The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.'", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909i/295.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Childrens", "Fiction", "Pirates", "Novels", "Literature", "Young Adult"], "asin": "0753453800", "isbn": "0753453800", "isbn13": "9780753453803", "publisher": "Kingfisher", "author": ["Robert Louis Stevenson", "N.C.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion", "title": "Persuasion", "titleComplete": "Persuasion", "description": "Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385172413i/2156.jpg", "genres": ["Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Historical", "Historical Romance", "Audiobook", "Fiction", "Classic Literature", "Literature", "19th Century"], "asin": "0192802631", "isbn": "0192802631", "isbn13": "9780192802637", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "author": ["\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0439\u043d \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d", "Jane Austen", "Richard Fadem", "Deidre Shauna Lynch", "James Kinsley"], "publishDate": 1072944000000, "characters": ["Charles Musgrove", "Sophia Croft", "Louisa Musgrove", "Henrietta Musgrove", "Sir Walter Elliot", "William Elliot", "Lady Russell", "Mrs. Smith", "Captain Harville", "Penelope Clay", "Captain James Benwick", "Admiral Croft", "Elizabeth Elliot", "Mary Musgrove", "Anne Elliot", "Captain Frederick Wentworth"], "places": ["Lyme Regis, England", "Somerset, England", "England", "United Kingdom", "Bath, Somerset, England"], "ratingHistogram": [11359, 25374, 115407, 226385, 301233], "ratingsCount": 679758, "reviewsCount": 31244, "numPages": 249, "language": "English"}

Within minutes of his arrival, however, the night takes a bizarre turn. A disturbing object - artfully encoded with five symbols - is discovered in the Capitol Building. Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient invitation...one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.When Langdon's beloved mentor, Peter Solomon - a prominent Mason and philanthropist - is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations - all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single, inconceivable truth.As the world discovered in The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons, Dan Brown's novels are brilliant tapestries of veiled histories, arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes.

Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous \"White City\" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1583433024i/397483.jpg", "genres": ["True Crime", "American History", "Biography", "Crime", "Historical", "Audiobook", "History", "Nonfiction", "Book Club", "Mystery"], "asin": "0609608444", "isbn": "0609608444", "isbn13": "9780609608449", "publisher": "Crown Publishers", "author": ["Erik Larson"], "publishDate": 1044950400000, "characters": ["Daniel Burnham", "H.H.

In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge. Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families.

Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets.Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note? But life is never as you dream it, and River House isn't what she'd always imagined it was. Intense, literary, and harrowing, Houdini Heart is a tale of bone-chilling horror, emotional torment, and psychological terror. Gripped by River House, trapped in an aging hotel of mirrors only Houdini could escape, how much can haunt a mind before it too is only a thing once imagined? \"A haunting and disturbing journey through the psyche.\"\u2014Erika Mailman, Author of \"The Witch's Trinity\"", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1510418043i/11324204.jpg", "genres": ["Thriller", "Psychological Horror", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Horror", "Gothic", "Magical Realism", "Literature", "Supernatural", "Mystery"], "asin": "0975925512", "isbn": "0975925512", "isbn13": "9780975925515", "publisher": "Eio Books", "author": ["Ki Longfellow"], "publishDate": 1303714800000, "ratingHistogram": [482, 483, 819, 1698, 2240], "ratingsCount": 5722, "reviewsCount": 228, "numPages": 254, "language": "English"}

So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant\u2019s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion.

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11989.The_Plague", "title": "The Plague", "titleComplete": "The Plague", "description": "The Plague is a novel by Albert Camus, published in 1947. It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434i/11989.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "20th Century", "Fiction", "Philosophy", "Novels", "French Literature", "Literature", "France", "Literary Fiction"], "publisher": "Vintage International", "author": ["Albert Camus", "Stuart Gilbert"], "publishDate": 667814400000, "characters": ["Father Paneloux", "Mme.

And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving\u2014and human\u2014figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1413215930i/656.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Historical", "War", "Fiction", "Novels", "Russian Literature", "Russia", "Literature", "19th Century"], "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "author": ["Louise Maude", "Aylmer Maude", "Leo Tolstoy"], "publishDate": 898758000000, "characters": ["Fedja Dolochov", "Nikolai Bolkonsky", "Anna Scherer", "Platon Karataev", "Maria Bolkonskaya", "Prince Andrey Bokonsky", "Mademoiselle Bourienne", "Vasili Denisov", "Lise Bolkonskaya", "Pierre Bezukhov", "Osip Basdeev", "Sonya Rostova", "Anna Drubetskaya", "Helene Kuragina", "Ilya Rostov", "Anatole Kuragin", "Adolf Berg", "Nikolai Rostov", "Mikhail Kutuzov", "Natasha Rostova", "Boris Drubetskoy", "Petya Rostov", "Vera Rostova"], "places": ["St. Petersburg", "Moscow", "Russia"], "ratingHistogram": [8145, 14600, 48547, 97346, 152067], "ratingsCount": 320705, "reviewsCount": 16660, "numPages": 1392, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Audie Award", "awardedAt": 1672560000000, "category": "Literary Fiction & Classics and Nominee for Best Female Narrator", "hasWon": null}]}
{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas", "title": "Cloud Atlas", "titleComplete": "Cloud Atlas", "description": "A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn\u2019t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852i/49628.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Contemporary", "Dystopia", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Fiction", "Novels", "Literature", "Literary Fiction"], "asin": "B00A2M3QD4", "isbn": "0375507256", "isbn13": "9780375507250", "publisher": "Random House", "author": ["David Mitchell"], "publishDate": 1092726000000, "characters": ["Isaac Sachs", "Joe Napier", "Sonmi~451", "Luisa Rey", "Nurse Noakes", "Ernie Blacksmith", "Zachry", "Jocasta Ayrs", "Hae-Joo Im", "Yoona-939", "Bill Smoke", "Old Georgie", "Mr. Meeks", "Javier Gomez", "Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck", "Rufus Sixsmith", "Vyvyan Ayrs", "Autua", "Fay Li", "Dr. Goose", "Timothy Cavendish", "Robert Frobisher", "Adam Ewing", "Meronym"], "places": ["Seoul, South Korea", "London, England", "Belgium", "England", "South Korea", "Neerbeke, West Vlaanderen", "Buenas Yerbas", "Maui, Hawaii", "The United States of America", "Chatham Islands"], "ratingHistogram": [7770, 15396, 41410, 83733, 97367], "ratingsCount": 245676, "reviewsCount": 21713, "numPages": 509, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Booker Prize", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Best SF Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Arthur C.

The Quran is composed of verses (Ayat) that make up 114 chapters (suras) of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0629) or Medinan (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0629) depending upon the place and time of their claimed revelation.

The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1275263838i/646462.jpg", "genres": ["Theology", "Classics", "Reference", "Mythology", "Islam", "Spirituality", "Philosophy", "History", "Nonfiction", "Religion"], "author": ["Anonymous", "Ya\u015far Nuri \u00d6zt\u00fcrk"], "publishDate": -41655139200000, "characters": ["Mary (mother of Jesus)", "Moses", "Adam (Bible)", "Abraham (Bible)", "Jesus"], "places": ["Mekka and Madina"], "ratingHistogram": [4324, 2866, 5065, 5159, 49519], "ratingsCount": 66933, "reviewsCount": 3624, "numPages": 604, "language": "Arabic"}

Nominated as one of America\u2019s best-loved novels by PBS\u2019s The Great American Read.Gulliver's Travels describes the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication.

Thoreau lived alone in a secluded cabin at Walden Pond. It is one of the most influential and compelling books in American literature. This new paperback edition-introduced by noted American writer John Updike-celebrates the 150th anniversary of this classic work. Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as \"Reading\" and \"The Pond in the Winter\" Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows. For the student and for the general reader, this is the ideal presentation of Thoreau's great document of social criticism and dissent.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630470982i/16902.jpg", "genres": ["Classics", "Biography", "Memoir", "Nature", "Philosophy", "Essays", "American", "Environment", "Literature", "Nonfiction"], "publisher": "Princeton University Press", "author": ["Henry David Thoreau", "Bill McKibben"], "publishDate": 1082271600000, "characters": ["Henry David Thoreau"], "places": ["Concord, Massachusetts", "The United States of America"], "ratingHistogram": [8146, 16287, 43067, 59996, 58510], "ratingsCount": 186006, "reviewsCount": 7469, "numPages": 352, "language": "English"}

The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children.

The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor,\" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463702268i/30236962.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Fiction", "Horror", "Paranormal", "Gothic", "Thriller", "Vampires", "Mystery"], "asin": "B000FCK6EI", "publisher": " Little, Brown and Company", "author": ["Elizabeth Kostova"], "publishDate": 1462086000000, "characters": ["Paul Ross", "Turgut Bora", "Anton Stoichev", "Ev\u00e1 Orb\u00e1n", "____ Getzi", "Hugh James", "Stephen Barley", "Bartholomew Rossi", "Vlad III", "Helen Rossi"], "places": ["Istanbul", "Turkey", "Amsterdam", "England", "Netherlands", "Oxford University, Oxford, England", "Budapest", "Hungary"], "ratingHistogram": [10571, 22909, 59529, 86978, 83133], "ratingsCount": 263120, "reviewsCount": 18028, "numPages": 704, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "International Horror Guild Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Hopwood Award", "awardedAt": 1041408000000, "category": "Novel in-progress", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Book Sense Book of the Year Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Best Adult Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "The Quill Award", "awardedAt": 1104566400000, "category": "Debut Author of the Year", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Lord Ruthven Award", "awardedAt": 1136102400000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}]}

Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.This Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist is the first critical edition to faithfully reproduce the text as its earliest readers would have encountered it from its serialisation in Bentley's Miscellany, and includes an introduction by Philip Horne, a glossary of Victorian thieves' slang, a chronology of Dickens's life, a map of contemporary London and all of George Cruikshank's original illustrations.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives \u2013 until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts.

Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want\u2014a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world\u2014all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way\u2014unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society\u2019s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503066414i/19501.jpg", "genres": ["Romance", "Chick Lit", "Biography", "Contemporary", "Travel", "Memoir", "Autobiography", "Spirituality", "Biography Memoir", "Nonfiction"], "asin": "0143038419", "isbn": "0143038419", "isbn13": "9780143038412", "publisher": "Riverhead Books", "author": ["Elizabeth Gilbert"], "publishDate": 1170144000000, "characters": ["Wayan", "Liz Gilbert", "Richard from Texas", "Felipe"], "places": ["India", "New York City, New York", "Southeast Asia", "Ubud, Bali", "Bali", "Indonesia", "Rome", "Italy"], "ratingHistogram": [121382, 186890, 418467, 480100, 503743], "ratingsCount": 1710582, "reviewsCount": 57783, "numPages": 368, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Puddly Award", "awardedAt": 1199174400000, "category": "Nonfiction", "hasWon": null}]}

The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\"Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His \"wonderful, awful\" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.

It begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867i/3412.jpg", "genres": ["Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Historical", "Adult", "Historical Romance", "Adult Fiction", "Fiction", "Novels", "Drama"], "publisher": "Avon Books", "author": ["Colleen McCullough"], "publishDate": 1009872000000, "characters": ["Meghann \"Meggie\" Cleary", "Rainer \"Rain\" Moerling Hartheim", "Francis \"Frank\" Cleary", "Luke O'Neill", "Ralph de Bricassart", "Stuart \"Stu\" Cleary", "Dane O'Neill", "Padraic \"Paddy\" Cleary", "Luddie Mueller", "Anne Mueller", "James and Patrick \"Jims and Patsy\" Cleary", "Jack Cleary", "Mary Elizabeth Cleary Carson", "Archbishop (later Cardinal) Vittorio di Contini-Verchese", "Fiona \"Fee\" Cleary", "Harold \"Hal\" Cleary", "Hughie Cleary", "Bob Cleary", "Justine O'Neill"], "places": ["Australia", "Outback", "Vatican City", "New Zealand"], "ratingHistogram": [4053, 11464, 51409, 109124, 170263], "ratingsCount": 346313, "reviewsCount": 7706, "numPages": 692, "language": "English"}

Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories. Now, in A Walk to Remember, he tells a truly unforgettable story, one that glimmers with all of his magic, holding us spellbound-and reminding us that in life each of us may find one great love, the kind that changes everything...", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498755310i/35545737.jpg", "genres": ["Romance", "Chick Lit", "Contemporary Romance", "Contemporary", "Love", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Fiction", "Drama", "Young Adult"], "publisher": "Grand Central Publishing ", "author": ["Nicholas Sparks"], "publishDate": 1496300400000, "characters": ["Landon Carter", "Jamie Sullivan"], "places": ["North Carolina", "Beaufort, North Carolina"], "ratingHistogram": [14433, 31439, 126089, 235115, 386467], "ratingsCount": 793543, "reviewsCount": 16245, "numPages": 215, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Iowa High School Book Award", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family\u2014Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma\u2019s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa\u2019s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running.

The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet.

But in addition to the parties, socials, and \u201cliteraries,\u201d work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It\u2019s not easy, and for the first time she\u2019s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend.

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives \"lickings\" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn \u00ad the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a \"tattle-tale.\"  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \"engaged\" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:\"TOM!\" No answer. \"TOM!\" No answer. \"What's gone with that boy, \u00a0I wonder? You TOM!\" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked\u00a0through\u00a0them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \"style,\" not service\u2014she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: \"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll\u2014\" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat. \"I never did see the beat of that boy!\"", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404811979i/24583.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Adventure", "Childrens", "Fiction", "Novels", "American", "Literature", "School", "Young Adult"], "asin": "0143039563", "isbn13": "9780143039563", "publisher": "Penguin Classics", "series": ["Adventures of Tom and Huck"], "author": ["Amanda Lee", "Mark Twain", "John Seelye", "Guy Cardwell", "Mark Hallaq"], "publishDate": 1141113600000, "characters": ["Huckleberry Finn", "Tom Sawyer"], "places": ["Hannibal, Missouri", "Missouri"], "ratingHistogram": [19504, 52157, 212115, 328957, 302036], "ratingsCount": 914769, "reviewsCount": 13292, "numPages": 244, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Lewis Carroll Shelf Award", "awardedAt": -94665600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}]}

The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him. What ensues is a novel of inexhaustible energy, humor, and philosophical depth, a work whose nuances emerge for the first time in Diana Burgin's and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor's splendid English version.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327867963i/117833.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Novels", "Magical Realism", "Russian Literature", "Russia", "Literature", "20th Century", "Literary Fiction"], "asin": "0679760806", "isbn": "0679760806", "isbn13": "9780679760801", "publisher": "Vintage International", "author": ["Hans Fronius", "Ellendea Proffer", "Mikhail Bulgakov", "Katherine Tiernan O'Connor", "Diana Lewis Burgin"], "publishDate": 825667200000, "characters": ["Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz", "Margarita Nicolaevna", "Behemot", "Master", "Pontius Pilate", "Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyryov", "Yeshua Ha-Nozri", "Korovyev", "Stephan Bogdanovich Likhodeyev", "Azazello", "Natasha (The Master and Margarita)", "Hella (The Master and Margarita)", "Lucifer"], "places": ["Jerusalem", "Russia", "Moscow"], "ratingHistogram": [5227, 12948, 42872, 94377, 182979], "ratingsCount": 338403, "reviewsCount": 19445, "numPages": 372, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Premi Cr\u00edtica Serra d'Or de Teatre i arts esc\u00e8niques", "awardedAt": 1072944000000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Read Russia Prize", "awardedAt": 1388563200000, "category": "20th-Century Russian Literature for Alexander Nitzberg", "hasWon": null}]}

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1659905828i/7235533.jpg", "genres": ["High Fantasy", "Epic", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Adult", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy", "Audiobook", "Fiction", "Magic"], "asin": "0765326353", "isbn": "0765326353", "isbn13": "9780765326355", "publisher": "Tor Books", "series": ["The Cosmere", "The Stormlight Archive"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"], "publishDate": 1283238000000, "characters": ["Sylphrena", "Adolin Kholin", "Kaladin Stormblessed", "Shallan Davar", "Hoid", "Dalinar Kholin", "Renarin Kholin", "Jasnah Kholin"], "places": ["Roshar"], "ratingHistogram": [3407, 5175, 20149, 90166, 344074], "ratingsCount": 462971, "reviewsCount": 32767, "numPages": 1007, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Locus Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "Best Fantasy Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "David Gemmell Legend Award", "awardedAt": 1293868800000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Whitney Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Best Novel of the Year", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Goodreads Choice Award", "awardedAt": 1262332800000, "category": "Fantasy and for Favorite Book and for Goodreads Author", "hasWon": null}]}

He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir.

He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine\u2014differences of race, of age, of cultural background\u2014that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination\u2014which dominates the early acts of the play\u2014turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795105i/12996.jpg", "genres": ["Poetry", "Classics", "Read For School", "Theatre", "Fiction", "Tragedy", "Plays", "Literature", "School", "Drama"], "asin": "B006U1QW78", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster", "author": ["Paul Werstine", "William Shakespeare", "Barbara A.

It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of \"the African\"\u2014Kunta Kinte\u2014but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him\u2014slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects\u2014and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities.

Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.Speak was a 1999 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529044298i/39280444.jpg", "genres": ["Banned Books", "Realistic Fiction", "School", "Contemporary", "High School", "Fiction", "Mental Health", "Coming Of Age", "Teen", "Young Adult"], "asin": "0374311250", "isbn": "0374311250", "isbn13": "9780374311254", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux (BYR)", "author": ["Laurie Halse Anderson"], "publishDate": 1547539200000, "characters": ["David Petrakis", "Ivy Hall", "Melinda Sordino", "Rachel Bruin", "Heather", "Andy Evans", "Nichole Smythe Burnell", "Mr. Freeman"], "places": ["Syracuse, New York"], "ratingHistogram": [12161, 29916, 110113, 195747, 232187], "ratingsCount": 580124, "reviewsCount": 30399, "numPages": 224, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "SCBWI Golden Kite Award", "awardedAt": 915177600000, "category": "Fiction", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Edgar Award", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": "Best Young Adult", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Michael L.

Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: \"Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally.\" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410727190i/24337.jpg", "genres": ["Romance", "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Childrens", "Fairy Tales", "Fiction", "Magic", "Retellings", "Middle Grade", "Young Adult"], "asin": "0590920685", "isbn": "0590920685", "isbn13": "9780590920681", "publisher": "Scholastic Books", "series": ["Ella Enchanted"], "author": ["Gail Carson Levine"], "publishDate": 904633200000, "characters": ["Mandy", "Hattie", "Prince Charmont", "Ella Varner", "Lucinda", "Areida", "Olive Abroholos Elephanta"], "ratingHistogram": [7812, 22097, 89696, 131281, 159072], "ratingsCount": 409958, "reviewsCount": 12013, "numPages": 240, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Newbery Medal", "awardedAt": 883641600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Mythopoeic Fantasy Award", "awardedAt": 915177600000, "category": "Children's Literature", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Grand Canyon Reader Award", "awardedAt": 915177600000, "category": "Teen Book", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Maryland Black-Eyed Susan Book Award", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": "Grade 6-9", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Vermont Golden Dome Book Award", "awardedAt": 915177600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Iowa Teen Award", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": "", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "California Young Readers Medal", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": "Middle School/Junior High", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Rebecca Caudill Young Readers' Book Award", "awardedAt": 946713600000, "category": null, "hasWon": null}]}

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, \"Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\"WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1547467608i/17250.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Read For School", "High School", "Historical", "Theatre", "Fiction", "Plays", "Literature", "School"], "asin": "0142437336", "isbn": "0142437336", "isbn13": "9780142437339", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["Christopher W.E.

It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509802323i/3876.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Fiction", "Spain", "Novels", "American", "Literature", "20th Century", "School", "Literary Fiction"], "publisher": "Pan Books", "author": ["Ernest Hemingway"], "publishDate": -410198400000, "characters": ["Michael Campbell", "Pedro Romero", "Jake Barnes", "Brett Ashley", "Robert Cohn", "Bill Gorton"], "places": ["Paris", "Basque Country", "Spain", "Pamplona", "Madrid", "France", "San Sebasti\u00e1n"], "ratingHistogram": [13948, 36006, 104296, 150131, 129983], "ratingsCount": 434364, "reviewsCount": 18092, "numPages": 189, "language": "English"}

The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589i/2696.jpg", "genres": ["Short Stories", "Poetry", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Read For School", "High School", "Fiction", "Classic Literature", "Literature", "School"], "asin": "0140424385", "isbn": "0140424385", "isbn13": "9780140424386", "publisher": "Penguin Books", "author": ["Geoffrey Chaucer", "Nevill Coghill"], "publishDate": 1044345600000, "characters": ["The Wife of Bath"], "places": ["England"], "ratingHistogram": [9182, 25622, 70665, 67526, 45047], "ratingsCount": 218042, "reviewsCount": 4249, "numPages": 504, "language": "English"}

{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses", "title": "Ulysses", "titleComplete": "Ulysses", "description": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialized in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire movement.\" According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking\". Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature. Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 to protracted textual \"Joyce Wars.\" The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose\u2014replete with puns, parodies, and allusions\u2014as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.'", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428891345i/338798.jpg", "genres": ["Banned Books", "Irish Literature", "Classics", "Unfinished", "Fiction", "Novels", "Literature", "20th Century", "Ireland", "Literary Fiction"], "publisher": "Vintage", "author": ["James Joyce", "John M.

Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even \"settle down\" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642i/43763.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Horror", "Paranormal", "Gothic", "Supernatural", "Vampires", "Urban Fantasy"], "asin": "0345476875", "isbn": "0345476875", "isbn13": "9780345476876", "publisher": "Ballantine Books", "series": ["The Vampire Chronicles"], "author": ["Anne Rice"], "publishDate": 1093935600000, "characters": ["Louis de Pointe du Lac", "Lestat de Lioncourt", "Claudia", "Daniel Molloy"], "places": ["Louisiana", "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Paris"], "ratingHistogram": [10802, 30757, 116094, 198221, 219188], "ratingsCount": 575062, "reviewsCount": 15451, "numPages": 346, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "British Fantasy Award", "awardedAt": 220953600000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}]}

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age 13 she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate\u2014a life and a role that she has never challenged ... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister\u2014and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. My Sister's Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100i/5043.jpg", "genres": ["Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Historical", "Fantasy", "Adult", "Audiobook", "Fiction", "Novels", "British Literature", "Medieval"], "publisher": "NAL Trade", "series": ["Kingsbridge"], "author": ["Ken Follett"], "publishDate": 1012809600000, "characters": ["Lord Percy Hamleigh", "Stephen of England", "Richard of Kingsbridge", "Alfred Builder", "Henry II of England", "Tom Builder", "Jack Jackson", "Empress Matilda", "Waleran Bigod", "Ellen", "Thomas Becket", "William Hamleigh", "Lady Regan Hamleigh", "Aliena", "Remigius", "Prior Philip"], "places": ["England"], "ratingHistogram": [13151, 23216, 79792, 216345, 416557], "ratingsCount": 749061, "reviewsCount": 36726, "numPages": 976, "language": "English"}

In recent years it has been named to \u201cbest novels\u201d lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy\u2014it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he\u2019s assigned, he\u2019ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller\u2019s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller\u2019s personal archive; and much more.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming \u201cunstuck in time.\u201d An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.", "imageUrl": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg", "genres": ["Classics", "Adventure", "Dystopia", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "War", "Audiobook", "Fiction", "Young Adult"], "asin": "0812550706", "isbn": "0812550706", "isbn13": "9780812550702", "publisher": "Tor", "series": ["Ender's Saga", "Enderverse:  Publication Order", "The Enderverse"], "author": ["Orson Scott Card"], "publishDate": 1096527600000, "characters": ["Dink", "Bonzo", "Mazer Rackham", "Major Imbu", "Valentine Wiggin", "Alai", "Hyrum Graff", "Andrew Wiggin", "Major Anderson", "Peter Wiggin", "Bernard", "Petra Arkanian", "\"Bean\""], "places": ["Outer Space"], "ratingHistogram": [23182, 41606, 156208, 403082, 722155], "ratingsCount": 1346233, "reviewsCount": 48824, "numPages": 324, "language": "English", "awards": [{"name": "Hugo Award", "awardedAt": 504950400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Nebula Award", "awardedAt": 473414400000, "category": "Best Novel", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premio Ignotus", "awardedAt": 757411200000, "category": "Mejor Cuento Extranjero", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Premi Ictineu", "awardedAt": 1388563200000, "category": "Millor novel\u00b7la tradu\u00efda", "hasWon": null}, {"name": "Margaret A.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman.
