        "user_review": "Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because Ireallydidn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish?And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves.And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there."

        "user_review": "\"I'm going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\"— Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds don't view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven't come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.InHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead's questions — and then some.Not only doesDeathly Hallowsrevisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil's Snare, Harry's best mate Ron bellows \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him\"Are you a wizard, or what?\"thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling's books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry's bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry's last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret \"shout-out\" to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that \"neither shall live while the other survives\", and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end.More than any of the other Potter books,Deathly Hallowsis a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort's Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears.This is not to say thatDeathly Hallowsdoesn't offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn't all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio showPotterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling's farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied."

I regret not reading it when I was younger, but I am so happy that I finally did, better late than never, right?The world built in these books is so real and tangible, it is truly a masterpiece. The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book.I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did. As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart. Now, having finished the last line, I am flooded with emotion. This series is more than a story or words on a page, it is magic."

I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\"- Interesting how, despite not hearing the prophesy, Voldemort came to the same solution on his own. Albeit for different reasons.(2) Bellatrix is the worst kind of groupie.(3) Tonks and Lupin are married already? I guess they eloped.08/05/2020- 4%(1) I don't want to attribute symbolism where there might be none, but wizards really do react to their wands being broken like they've been gelded.(2) \"The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.\"- Hermione has been plenty stupid before. It's just that hers has to do with common sense.08/06/2020- 6%(1) \"What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike?\"- I mean, saying nothing is always an option, that is, if you dislike them enough to not even want to talk.(2) It wouldn't surprise me at all if Dedalus Diggle was modeled after the White Rabbit. He's short, constantly checks his giant pocket watch, and always worries about being late.08/07/2020- 8%(1) Re Polyjuice: '\"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly.'- Foreshadowing the later Ron subplot.(2) '\"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on ... her waist.'- Well, can't look too eager.08/08/2020- 11%(1) Lupin: \"Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!\"- Exactly what I've been saying!(2) 'Hermione flew at [Ron] and hugged him tightly. \"I thought — I thought —\"\"I'm all right,\" said Ron, patting her on the back.\"'- Ah, Ron's learning.

Mark your territory.08/10/2020- 18%(1) Harry's already got Ginny, so why does Ron gift him a book on getting girls?(2) \"You've really got an eye for that sort of thing.\"\"Thank you, Ron!\" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry [smiled] to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments [in] his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches.08/11/2020- 21%(1) '\"Come and dance,\" [Ron] added abruptly to Hermione. She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.\"Ah, they are together now?\" asked Krum, momentarily distracted.\"Er — sort of,\" said Harry.'- Harry being a total bro.- Krum seems allayed by this news, like a suspicion's been proven true.08/12/2020- 23%(1) Harry: \"We just need to wipe their memories.\"Ron: \"But I've never done a Memory Charm.\"Hermione: \"Nor have I ... but I know the theory.\"- Didn't Hermione do a memory charm on her parents? I guess there's a difference between erasing a memory and implanting false ones.(2) Ron takes every chance to hug Hermione. So he's either an opportunist or formed a habit.08/13/2020- 26%(1) \"[Hermione's] fingers inches from Ron's. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made [Harry] feel strangely lonely.\"- Classic third-wheel talk right there.(2) Ron: \"Elf magic isn't like wizard's magic... I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can't.\"- Wizarding common sense is why Ron's valuable.08/14/2020- 29%(1) Re arresting Muggle-borns: \"I'll tell everyone Hermione's my cousin.\"Hermione covered Ron's hand with hers and squeezed it. \"Thank you, Ron, but I couldn't let you.\"\"You won't have a choice,\" said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back.\"- Ah, the old Abram and Sarai in Egypt trick.(2) \"Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him.\"- See, Ron's useful.08/15/2020- 32%(1) \"Harry felt sure [Ron and Hermione] were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.\"- Classic third-wheel talk right there.(2) '\"Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore's study — Merlin's pants!\" [Hermione] shrieked.'- I know enough of British English to understand that \"pants\" means something markedly different than the American definition.08/16/2020- 35%(1) \"A bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down ... to protect the prosecutors from ... from the dementors.\"- Umbridge's patronus reveals the viciousness beneath her kitty exterior.(2) '\"Expec — Expecto patronum,\" said Hermione.

Mrs. Cattermole.'- Well, glad she has a flaw.08/17/2020- 37%(1) \"Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.\"- Hermione swoons over sensitive Ron. He should do that more often.- #1 rule of swooning: don't get caught swooning.(2) Hermione's an awful cook. Flaws make her endearing.08/18/2020- 39%(1) Ted Tonks: \"The Prophet? ... You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\"- Ah, in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king... or however it goes.(2) Ron: \"We're about as near getting rid of [the horcrux] as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!\"- \"Effing\"? Some evil locket! Can't even influence Ron to use real effing swears.08/19/2020- 41%Kiss rejected! Sorry, Harry. She loves Ron.(1) Hermione: \"I'm staying. Ron, we said we'd go with Harry, we said we'd help.\"Ron: \"I get it. You choose him.\"Hermione: \"Ron, no — please — come back, come back!\"- Ah, the subtext is exquisite.(2) \"[Hermione] threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.\"- That's 4/7 books she's had a big Ron-cry.08/20/2020- 43%(1) \"Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs.\"- Harry must be thinking, \"I can't smell that bad? Can I?\"(2) Harry: \"Gryffindor came from Godric's Hollow?\"Hermione: \"As the village is named after him, I'd have thought you might have made the connection.\"08/21/2020- 45%(1) \"[Hermione] stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase.\"- When feeling shaky, bookcases are Hermoine's refuge.(2) \"[Harry] left [Hermione] sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.\"- On one hand, she broke his wand by accident. On the other hand, she did render him magically impotent.08/22/2020- 47%Literally Ron's worst nightmare.(1) Rita Skeeter: 'Elphias \"Dogbreath\" Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick [Dumbledore] had picked up at school.'- Sounds like film-Ron, except for the \"Dogbreath\" part. Lavender, for one, seemed to love his breath.(2) Rita Skeeter openly admits to using Veritaserum on Bathilda Bagshot. Last I checked, that was illegal.08/23/2020- 49%Ah, relationship back to normal. ¡La pasión!(1) Riddle: \"Least loved, always ... Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend ... Second best, always, eternally overshadowed.\"(2) \"Riddle-Hermione ... was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione.\"- Don't tell that to real Hermione that... being terrible to Ron's totally her thing.08/24/2020- 51%(1) Harry: \"She's like my sister ... I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew.\"- Didn't seem that way in the film... funny way to act toward your sister.(2) Ron destroys the locket and then has himself a big Hermione-cry. Eh, he was due. Seeing as she has four big Ron-cries under her belt.08/25/2020- 53%(1) Hermione to Harry: \"Maybe it's something you need to find out for yourself.\"Ron: \"Yeah! ... That makes sense.\"Hermione: \"No, it doesn't!\"- Being anti-Ron conflicts with being logical.(2) Harry: \"You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\"Ron: \"All's fair in love and war, and this is a bit of both.\"- Aww, he loves her... I'm sure not as a sister.08/26/2020- 55%(1) '\"There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —\"\"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron ... Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.'- Don't compare your girl to your mum!(2) Xenophilius: \"[Luna] is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.\"Harry: \"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\"- Checkmate!08/27/2020- 58%(1) Potterwatch code names:- Lee Jordan is River (as in Jordan River)- Kingsley is Royal (kings are royal)- Remus is Romulus (twin founders of Rome)- Fred is Rodent (because Weasley sounds like weasel), but wants to be called Rapier (???)(2) Hermione: \"I only said that to try and persuade you ... I didn't really believe it!\"- Questionable morals, that Hermione.08/28/2020- 60%(1) Why bother to change your name if you don't want anyone to say it?(2) '\"What is it, Wormtail?\" called Lucius Malfoy from above.\"Nothing!\" Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail's wheezy voice. \"All fine!\"'- I didn't know Ron could imitate voices. Must be a hit at parties.(3) Wonder if it still counts as suicide if your arm has a mind of its own?08/29/2020- 62%(1) Harry uses three wands at once to stupefy Greyback... makes you wonder whether multiple-core wands are a thing, or why no one owns more than one wand.- It'd probably be akin to using a machine gun.(2) \"With a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.\"08/30/2020- 64%(1) \"The steady rhythm of [Harry's] arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows ... Horcruxes ... Hallows ... Horcruxes ...\"- In the end, he chooses horcruxes.(2) Hermione and Luna wearing Fleur's clothes is a touch of hilarity beneath the sadness.(3) \"Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.\"- Aww... it's like a bicycle-built-for-two.08/31/2020- 66%(1) Olivander: \"Walnut and dragon heartstring ... Twelve-and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\"- As a woodworker, I can say that walnut has high acidity, and is one of the few species too toxic for mulch.(2) Hermione: \"I'm a Mudblood!\"Ron: \"Don't call yourself —\"Hermione: \"Why shouldn't I? ... Mudblood, and proud of it!\"09/01/2020- 68%(1) Bill: \"Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you'll know all that from History of Magic.\"- Yes, History of Magic... smile and nod.(2) '\"Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \"Congratulations!\" and Ron said, \"Blimey, a baby!\" as if he had never heard of such a thing before.'- To be fair, Ron was a year old when Ginny was a baby.09/02/2020- 70%(1) '\"You'll be using [Bellatrix's] actual wand,\" said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, \"so I reckon you'll be pretty convincing.\" Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her.'- Just don't use it for firewood or compost... walnut's toxic.(2) Harry casts the Imperius Curse which, while Unforgivable, is probably forgivable in this instance.09/03/2020- 72%(1) \"Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.\"- Ah, how very Ron and Hermione. How they each handle stress strikes at the heart of their personalities.(2) I think it's indicative of how good a job he's done that I've not mentioned Stephen Fry at all during this re-read.09/04/2020- 75%(1) '\"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters. Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.'- Well, it must be a real Hallow then, not summonable and thus not subject to other magic.(2) 'It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, \"Expecto Patronum!\"'- Aww... they're Harry's happy thought!09/05/2020- 77%(1) Ron: \"Yeah, well, food's one of the five exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.\"- Hermione must be beaming.(2) Seamus: \"We've been hiding out [in the Room of Requirement] ... and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up —\"Lavender: \"— and thought they'd quite like to wash, yes.\"- So... boys don't \"require\" washing?09/06/2020- 79%(1) Harry uses the Cruciatus Curse and McGonagall uses the Imperius Curse. Sure, rules get thrown out when it comes to war, but do the ends justify the means?(2) In the film McGonagall duels Snape one-on-one until he flees. In the book, it's Flitwick that runs Snape off.(3) 'Professor McGonagall dryly, \"we teachers are rather good at magic, you know.\"'- Ha! Sassy.*character limitClick here for the rest"

The final adventure, towards which we've been sailing for - through six amazing Hogwarts years - is here at last. And yet again, Rowling surpasses her own standards to bring us the most adventurous book of the entire series, to conclude everything is a most dramatic way. Twist after twist after twist is going to keep the reader immersed more than ever. Be warned: once started, you won't have a moment's rest till your finish this one!\"Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches\"It seems redundant now to repeat all the good things about Harry Potter books in general - from plot to writing style - which never reached a plateau, but kept on improving. All of that is still there. But setting up the atmosphere for events has reached a level that is far beyond anything we've seen before. And the complexity of the events has also been increased. Even the few sup-plots are highly detailed and complex, and contributes a lot to the main story. It gives a very fulfilling feeling, when the reader is allowed to connect all the dots as progressing towards the end, tying up a lot of loose ends. Also, it's unbelievable how well the plot twists are introduced - whether they are happy or sad - maintaining suspense better than ever.\"permettez-moi to assister vous,\"The reader is bound to encounter a lot of heartbreaking disappointments here, but all that help make the ending much more satisfying. I did miss the occasional humor, though it would not have complimented well the dark world we are in right now. Oh, and I'm really happy that I only had to hate Snape for a few days... (from finish of Half-blood prince till now) I guess that's the good thing about reading all the books of series at once: less anxiety!\"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure!\"When I started Philosopher's Stone, it made me realize that I've been missing out on a lot - a world of magic which is full of amazing characters. Then the journey got ever so thrilling and entertaining, with each book outperforming the previous one in every possible way. It's been three magical weeks for me - literally and figuratively - from the starting of the first book till the last. I don't recall ever been immersed in a book series as much as I did with Harry Potter, and, though the ending was great, it's sad not being able to continue, to know that this is the end. I've watched the first few HP movies a long time ago, but those didn't come anywhere near the books in my opinion, and I really wasn't a fan. But now, I'm finally enlightened as to why Harry Potter series is much loved by millions. It's impossible not to, once you're through with the books! A well thought out foundation put in place in first three books, then setting stage for the core of the series in next two and finally, an incredibly thrilling ending with the last two books, while each book being a five-star read, at least for me. Harry Potter became the my all-time-favorite book series.\"Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,\""

        "user_review": "Hot take: I like A Very Potter Musical more than I like the Harry Potter series. Please feel free to physically fight me. (And no, \"AVPM wouldn't exist without the series\" is not a valid argument, because duh.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...God, what an unexpected result this is.Let's talk about it for six pages.I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series forfive months.More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February,and I didn't pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort's, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let's talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin' but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw thosegloriousGIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like,What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we're eating?(Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying \"Accio salmon\" in order to eat and were just like,That information's going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and takeliterally no effortby the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I'm almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it's over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I'm big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We'll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he's Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he's treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD'S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that's who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He's barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we'll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT'S \"Garry\") just based off of Ginny's apparent greatness. BUT NO IT'S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn't be less cute. It's justI miss Ginnyyyyyyyyyoverandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It's just J.K. Rowling being like,Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here's a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne,Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer.SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN'S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don't...I don't even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn't Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn't Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she's all, \"Why won't Lupin loooooooove me.\" Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn't mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn't mean that James's dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don't just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, \"Oh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I'll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it's almost like I've emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!\"You can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She's a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can't!!! Because shekeeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, \"You and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,\" which is really Joanne saying, \"I have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?\"Here's one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there's a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly \"dies\" when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry thatisn't, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily's protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I'M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I'M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain't seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I'm going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is \"get in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.\"AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped.either that or this book was garbàge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request. (the whole contract is fine print.)ah jesus. you guys thought you hated me before.review to comeeeeee-------------------------me waiting for this book to be over"

Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves,the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneaksomething tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley's computer, or put on the television and flicked through thechannels to his heart's content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling toremember those times; it was like remembering a younger brotherwhom he had lost.ثم موت هيدويج..والذي لا اعتقد ان هاري وحده شعر بالحزن لذلك بالتأكيد كلنا شعرنا به لذكرياتنا معها و نجحت المؤلفه في تعميق ذلك الاحساس باخر مشاهدها في برايفت درايف. وان كنت احسب للفيلم تعميق دورها بهذه الطريقههنا ستشعر بالمعني الذي تقدمه المؤلفه والنادر تقديمه في روايات تصنف بنفس النوعيةComing of Ageستكون كهاري واصدقاءه..تشعر بكم المسئوليه عليهم ..توديعهم للطفوله والمراهقه للالتفات للمسئوليه الكبيره الواقعه عليهم كي يتغلبوا علي المحن والقهر الواقع عليهم وعلي كل من حولهموتبدأ

في \"دمبلدور\" والذي بوفاته صار الكثيرون يشككون فيه وفي توجههاته و اسلوبه وحياتهيبدأ يشك ان دمبلدور لم يكن يثق فيه ولم يعلمه بما فيه الكفايه ولم يمنحه ما يساعده في المهمه التي القي بحملها علي عاتقه قبل وفاته ..فيتسأل هل كان حقا يهتم به ام انه تركه للمجهول دون مساعده واضحه كما صار الكثيرين يتهمونه بذلك..تركه ليهلك دون مساعدههل حقا كان وقت شبابه يبحث عن ان يحكم بالقوه؟يحكم في ان يكون هو ومن مثله

للحكام..انظر الي كتاب \"حياه واكاذيب دمبلدور \" للصحفيه الكاتبه الرهيبه ريتا سكيتر...انظر كيف حولت احداث تاريخيه وقامت بتفسيرها علي اهوائها مما يؤدي لزعزعه الايمان في الرمز المتمثل في دمبلدورمما لا شك

المؤلفه بذكاء كيف ان السحر لا يجلب لك الطعام من لا شئ-القوه والبحث عنها حتي وان كان للخير الاعظم لم يكن من الحكمه ابدا..دمبلدور كان خير مثال لذلكوعاما قالت جي كي رولينج وقت انتهائها من الروايه انها

من السهوله ان تقتنع ان بطل قصه يسير الي هلاكه..موته ..حتي وان كان يعلم انه حتميا بكل ثقه وهو يشعر انه يفعل الواجب عليه؟من اصعب حبكات الدراما والتي دائما ما يقع فيها الادباء عندما يقدم البطل نفسه للموت..دائما ما يكون الامر سطحيا ويبتعد كثيرا عن الواقعالا ان الامر ليس هكذا ابدا في هذه الحاله..في هذه الروايه العبقريهان المؤلفه اختارت للجزء الاخير تيمه الموت..وهذا ما كان واضح ايضا من كل الرموز التي قدمتها حتي الدينيه منها والتي لاول مره تفصح عن توجهاتها الدينيه.هاري كان خائفا من الموت..كبشر طبيعي وليس كبطل..كان يذهب للقاء الموت وهو يتمني ان يراه احد ويوقفه..كان يفكر في شئ واحد,هل سيؤلمه الموت؟ نعم هو ذاهب ليموت ولكنه لا يستطيع كتمان خوفه..هذه-بالاضافه لكل الروعه في رسم الشخصيه- جعلت لهاري روح ونبض بكلماتها الذكيه ..لهذا تشعر ان فعلا جي كي رولينج يجب ان تلقب كملكه الروايههاري ما زال هاري..مازال يتعلم من اخطائه..مازال كما وصفه دمبلدور في الفصل قبل الاخيرHot Head راسه حاميلم يكن ملاك باي حال من الاحوال..ولكنه كان بشرياكل الشخصيات في الروايه كانت تستكمل دورها بكل سلاسه لم يكن هناك تجاوزات او اشياء غير متوقعه ..ربما كانت خفيه لنا بذكاء وحنكه ..وأؤكد انه اذا تم اعاده قراءه الاجزاء كلها مره اخري ستكتشف ان ليس بالامر اي خدعه..كل مافي الامر هو ان المؤلفه نجحت بعبقريه شديه اخفاء ما تريد من الشخصيات لاظهارها في وقت لاحقكذلك بالنسبه للدوافع التي تختلف بحسب المواقف التي تقع فيها الشخصيات , مثلا عائله مالفوي ودوافعها, دافع هاري عند عودته لهوجوارتس والذي لم يكن من اجل المحاربه في ذلك الوقت.لا اعتقد - من وجهه نظري- ان المؤلفه افسدت روح شخصيه او خيبت املنا في اي حدث من احداث الروايهومن اجمل المواقف في الروايه هو المواجهه الاخيره بين هاري وفولدمورت.. والذي يدعوه فيها للندم علي كل من قتله..الندم علي افعاله في روحه التيقسمها وارواح الاخرين التي ازهقها\"You're right. But before you try to killme, I'd advise you to think about what you've done. . . . Think, andtry for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\"\"What is this?\"Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this.

Try forsome remorse. . . .\"حتي هنا الامر ليس غريب علي هاري , وليس غريب علي فولدمورت رد فعله عنهاما عن سناب..فبما اني قرأت الروايات مره ثانيه فاني اؤكد ان من المستحيل ان يتم التشكيك ان نهايه شخصيته كانت ملفقه او بها خدعه..الشخصيه مرسومه بكل دقه من اول ظهور لهالنهايه*******لن يكون هناك نهايه لما اريد ان اقوله حول سلسله هاري بوتر..اعتقد اني يجب ان اعيد كتابه الريفيوهات من الجزء الاول حتي استطيع كتابه كل ماتستحقه السلسلههي سلسله انصح اي من لم يقراها او استكفي بمشاهده الفيلم البدء فيها , فهي ستغير مفهومك عن الروايات..لن تجد مثل ذلك الخيال الواقعي,الشخصيات التي تنبض عبر الصفحات, الاحداث الشيقه التي تدخلك فيها دخول هاري بوتر لمذكرات توم ريدل في الجزء الثاني :)محمد العربيالنسخه العربيه من 25 يناير 2008الي 30 يناير 200814/01/16: ورحل عن عالمنا المبدع الذي جسد شخصية بروفيسور سناب بمنتهي الأتقان, الان ريكمان"

It's tough to pick a favorite from the group, but the Deathly Hallows is a worthy contender for that coveted first spot. As the dark tension that began growing at the finish of the Goblet of Fire has come full circle, I felt this was the perfect finale to a (rightfully) highly acclaimed series. I'm so happy to have finally experienced first hand this beloved story arc that so many readers hold dear to their heart. I'm already trying to figure out when I can reread them. 😭 Now, on to our annual Christmas time watching of the films while we wrap presents! 😍———Gulp.This was my PIFM choice for the month of November in the A Good Thriller group here on Goodreads. I can't believe its finally time for my first read through of the Harry Potter books to come to an end, but I'm also dying to read this one and see how it compares to the film."

I did. The Prince's Tale gets to me every time. The epilogue seems to belong to Cursed Child more than to Deathly Hallows, but J.K. Rowling is only human."

        "user_review": "After watching 20th anniversary of my all time best fantasy series( feeling sorry for both Roberts and Watson), I chose the last book to return back to the universe for saying see you soon to my favorite characters.Even though the book is slow burn, I didn't mind as long as I already know where it goes. It might be my fourth time read and I'm so sure it won't be last!So many people may think why we connect with HP books so deeply? My answer is it awakens different feelings that change at each people. For me: it brings out so many complex feelings: an emotional trip in memory lane that reminds of my excitement at each time I start a new book of the series. Hope, sadness, fear always blended. Seeing my favorite characters' growing up, making mistakes, choosing their paths and evolving are the best things I've witnessed!The entire final book focuses on Harry's teaming up with his friends- more like family- Ron and Hermione to finish the task Dumbledore gave them.The ending of the book gives us the epic final that has been promised from the beginning. Its big screen adaptation truly reflected the terror, emotional breakdowns, excitement of the conclusion even though making two additional movies from one book was not the best idea!Prisoner of Azkaban is gonna be my favorite book of the series( the author's significant walk to the dark side and Harry's big discovery about his godfather) but it was still great to have fourth tango with the final book of the series!I think it's time for me head out Universal Studios to visit Hogswart and have a thrill ride for showing my tribute to this strongest installment of the century!Let's see my favorite quotes;\"It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.\" —Remus Lupin\"No, Harry, you listen,' said Hermione. 'We're coming with you. That was decided months ago — years, really.'\"\"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\"It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.\" — Albus Dumbledore\"All was well.\""

        "user_review": "First of all, It's awesome finding out that this book is Dedicated specially to you by the Queen herself -for me Joanna Rowling is the English Queen for Magic, just as there's a Queen for muggles- & it's Really yours personally..If you Stuck With Harry Until The Very End.I've been stuck with Harry myself for 10 years now..when I first read the Arabic edition of the 1st book on Sep.2003.. I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other HomeI finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever.Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter SagaThe Plot********Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling?**Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it.**And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape.**How he can do all that without Dumbledore , Black and all of those he can't tell about his quest as Dumbledore ask him to not tell but to Ron and Hermione.We all thought it will be difficult to fit it all in one last volume ,and to wrap up characters and events.But the amazing plot of that book didn't only fit for that all. and also add a new element \"The Deathly Hallows\" and fit it perfectly into the full story..I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying \"Voldemort\"'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters**************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no \"new\" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the \"real responsibilities\" that comes with the coming of age.or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any \"Exaggeration\" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawnThe Message***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.ِِAnd look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER\"You're right. But before you try to killme, I'd advise you to think about what you've done. . . . Think, andtry for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\"\"What is this?\"Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harrysaw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyeswhiten.\"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . .I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try forsome remorse. . . .\"It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some.It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of LoveSo glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real lifeThank you Joanna Rowling.Mohammed Arabey16 April 20132 May 2013 \"Harry Potter International Day\"****On That Day 2nd May 1998 ,The Battle of Hogwarts and Lord Voldemort's downfall .Happy 15th Anniversary..14/01/16R.I.P Alan Rickman..one of the greatest talented actors ever,here's his last farewell for a character he made so real..Oh God, And that's even Sadder...:("

I liked that.but the newspaper articles about the backstory was boring. & the part before the main story begins, & the camping-no-clues part, without anything interesting (or useful) happens were slow.This is the most emotional book in HP series; from the beginning. maybe the most crying book of my whole life:I cried at first, 25%, in the middle, later in the middle, in 75% & many times toward the end:Hedwig's death, Kreacher's tale & Regulus' bravery & kindness & acts trying to make his mistake right (why if my fav character is not the main hero, they ended up already dead?!😭 James & Regulus), the scene of James & Lily's death was very emotional, especially at the end when little Harry found out something was wrong, Luna's room, even cried (a bit tho) for wormtail, Dobby's death, many Deaths in the battle of Hogwarts😭 the Forest again; how he felt about Life when it was going to an end, his courage to face the his destiny... & Always (I liked Snape just because he made hard times for Harry. (ahhhh Evil me!) although I can't forgive Snape as Harry did; but this part was very emotional & he turned out to be a hero.)sobbing & curling in the corner. (I am even crying now as I'm just typing these.)always crying; at all the readings.also Stephen Fry narrating was amazing; made me cry even more & also at the last 40%.All his emotions not just in quotes, but in Harry's thoughts, memories & feelings, all their tones, all parts their voices broke, shattered or trembled, now very very tangible & more realistic. (better than my imagination; also Harry's voice is exactly the voice I always heard in my head reading the books.)I love this book!I think in my 7th read, I cried even more over my most crying book.(I mean, I cried all over the 'forest again' chapter & the last sentences made me completely burst into tears.)don't worry, it has fun times too.the ending was brilliant! mysteries solved! (& I'm mad about changing it in the movie!)epic battle!I had kinda subconsciously known before I read it for the first time that where the end battle would be. it just made sense that way. back Home one last time, defend Hogwarts.\"Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known.\"(I mean can you imagine the battle between Harry & Voldemort after he destroyed all the horcruxes happening in like an unknown nowhere land or something?-nope, right? XD)Romione & then Harry's reaction was priceless!and the Flaw in the Plan....One of my favourite chapters in the whole HP! I love the last battle. I love the way Harry explained it. (confident! courageous! sassy! taunting!) the clues even I, as a reader, might have missed. (at least in the first read I did. that's the whole point of a story being a legend, you don't see the clues wrapping up in the story until it's explained & next times you re-read it, you'll see them.)I can read those last 3 chapters over & over again.so exciting! so epic! so brilliant! (& they CHANGED that in the movies! How DARE they!?)I was at the edge of my seat for the last 30%. all of it. in most of my readings. so thrilling! never gets old!Harry is smart & brave.& I love the epilogue. fun & great.2021 May:now I can say I read the whole HP series 10 times, yay! until next time!& at my first read, I was afraid about how the story would be ended (because Harry is my favourite character) & this was my first series (no experience, no reader prediction ability, etc, etc.& I thought he must die (& at that time, I didn't have a clue he was\"you-know-what\". I just thought the story only ended when Harry dies. (actually I was afraid series only ended when the hero dies in General, so that way no other books would come out.) I'm actually thinking I was kind of right at some points. I'm surprised!but you know...All was well..\"Of course it is happening inside your head, Reader, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\"-World building: ★★★★★/5Characters: ★★★★★/5/ Characters development: ★★★★★/5Written style: ★★★★★/5/ feelz: ★★★★★/5plot: ★★★★/5General idea: ★★★★★/5-my edit of my feelings about this epic story with Queen's quote:"

Notjustthe books, but we kinda agedwithhim(or thereabouts). It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters.And wewerethere together. We were atmidnight release partiesand movie theaters, lined up and excited to share in the adventure. I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, andtheme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well."

Rowling shows us that even the nastiest of people deserve a degree of sympathy. Draco's story was more complex than we realised. He was never the person he secretly wanted to be: a good man.3.This scene was written superbly, the saddest moment of the series for me."

He accepts that he must die and understands that there are far worse things in the living world than dying.\"-Albus DumbledoreTo you, yes you, reader of this review, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews you'll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so don't tell me you haven't been warned.^^ToJ.K. Rowling,there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can't praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you're still human and surely you've recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can't blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death ofFred!. Why? Why kill him? Haven't you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don't think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don't the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don't you thinkProfessor Severus Snapedeserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened toProfessor Moody'sbody? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn't shed a tear. I just wish I read your books beforeAllegiantandMockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings.To Harry Potter, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.To Hermione Granger, you are the most kick-ass heroine I've ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest.To Ron Weasley, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.To Fred and George, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you.George, it's hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*To Hagrid (and Graupy), *hugs* I'll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.To Professor Snape,you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore's Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails*To Professor Dumbledore, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving.To Dumbledore's Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,, you guys are awesome!To the Order of the Phoenix,you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I'm so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much.To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant!To the Malfoys,uh I don't know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you!To Dobby,*wails* I can't…just thank you so much. You're the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know.To Kreacher,you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle.To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback, I have two words foryou. \"AVADA KEDAVRA!\"To Umbridge,off to Azkaban, you go!To Voldemort, that's right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?To the rest of the fallen,Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others, like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails*To the movie makers and actors, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'mHouse Gryffindor, hurray!I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.ToJiaandKyra, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends(March 06 is their actual birthday). You are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages. Savor that gift and seize your most special day! <3"

        "user_review": "Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in \"backwardness\" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting.Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the \"wronged\" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again?Of course this elevation of / identification with the \"wounded\"/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.)I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral \"triumph\", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it.Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:\"Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her.\" (p.178)\"'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You'vealwaysbeen a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'\" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my reviewThe Kite Runnerin February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review ofThe Kite Runner.This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion.Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is \"It was OK;\" 1 star is \"I didn't like it.\" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're \"supposed\" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such asDriving Miss Daisy,Clara's Heart,Bagger Vance, orGhost(all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't readA Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired."

        "user_review": "In 2012, when I was Mathematics teacher at a private high school in Iran, I had an Afghan student in my class. Sometimes, I discussed with my students about literature, and I told them of novels and poem. I found it very strange that my students had no interest in literature and even sometimes looked with hostility to this discussion. Days passed and much time was left to the end of school year. One day I saw Ali, Afghan student, came to me and had a booklet in his hand and I saw in his eyes several times as if he wanted to say something, but he was quiet. I waited for a little, and after a few moments, I began to speak. He smiled, and with a special Afghan accent, he said \" I have written a story, sir \" and became quiet again. I said \"it's excellent! \", and I asked, \"do you read books? \". Yes, sir, he replied. I asked, \"what kind of books do you like? \". Mark Twain and John Steinbeck and Jules Verne, he answered. I asked what you have written? He replied I wrote a story about a 13 years old Afghan boy who immigrated to Iran. I got his booklet, and I read it in a week. It was a dark story. A week later, we discussed again after class. Ali invited me to go his house at night for reading books. I was pleased, and I greeted this plan. When night arrived, I took the kite runner and went to Ali's home. When I entered the house, I saw a house with mud walls that has no rooms, except a small hull that there was a table in the middle of it and almost nine children were dining. Of clothes of Ali's father, it was obvious that he was a building worker and he welcomed me very sincerely. I thanked him, and I went to the storehouse in the corner of the yard that Ali had made it, a place to be alone. Ali took the book and with incredible passion began to read. This process was repeated almost every night for a week, and we have read half of the Kite Runner. Among pages of the book, Ali informed me about Afghanistan, explained of how twenty people, entered Iran with a small car, illegally and secretly. Of how his classmates ridiculed him because of his Afghan accent, of how he was forced to work in a brick burner factory all days after the school, of how his dad has forced him to marry at the age of 13 in the summer. Then Ali proceeded to speak that he wants to be a writer and prizes the Nobel award. I saw in his room that he had Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Hafiz and Rumi's book poem. When I looked at his face, I saw an unusual man who was ahead of his time and situation. Ali said, because Afghans have been banned of the registration in public schools in Tehran, he is forced to register in a private school, and now he and his mother must work hard to pay school charges.The next week, I went to class, but I didn't see Ali. When I asked the guys about him, they replied that because his father hadn't citizenship card and passport, he was arrested, and all of them have deported to Afghanistan. I was agitated that I couldn't continue reading Kite Runner never. Even I felt so depressed and sad when I saw the book in bookstores. Until this spring, after three years, I got a message in WhatsApp messenger from Ali, that congratulated teachers day to me. He was written that he married to a girl who was in love with her and they have a two months old girl baby. He was written he is working at a bookstore in Kabul and he has read almost thousand books in three years. He was written they have the 4G Internet in Kabul and I replied him, it's supposed to we have 4G in Tehran as well, soon! When I received the message, I could reread the Kite Runner. It was a great book, especially for me, recall nostalgia of tired immigrants and unfavorable circumstances.*************************************سال 1391 زمانی که معلم ریاضی حق التدریس یه دبیرستان خصوصی شده بودم یه دانش اموز افغان هم سر کلاس داشتم ..هرازگاهی به بهونه های مختلف بحث رو به ادبیات میکشوندم و از رمان و شعر برای بچه ها میگفتم .. برام خیلی عجیب بود که بچه های کلاس هیچ علاقه ای به ادبیات نشون نمیدادن و گاهی حتی با دید تمسخر هم به قضیه نگاه میکردن.. روزها میگذشت و زمان زیادی به پایان سال تحصیلی باقی نمونده بود.. یک روز بعد از پایان کلاس دیدم علی محصل افغان , اومد کنار میز من و تووی دستش یه دفترچه داشت و تووی چشاش دیدم که چندبار انگار میخواست حرفی بزنه اما سکوت کرد.. کمی صبر کردم و بعد از چند لحظه سر صحبت رو باز کردم.. لبخند زد و با لهجه افغانی خاصش گفت \"اقا من یه داستان نوشتم \".و سکوت کرد.. گفتم خیلی عالیه.. پرسیدم. کتاب هم میخونی? گفت اقا بله..گفتم چی میخونی? جواب داد مارک تواین و جان اشتاین بک و ژول ورن.. گفتم چی مینویسی ..جواب داد یه رمان نوشتم درباره یه پسر سیزده ساله افغان که به ایران مهاجرت کرده. دفترچه رو از علی گرفتم و تووی یک هفته خوندم. داستان غمگین بود. یک هفته بعد دوباره بعد از کلاس با هم صحبت کردیم. علی من رو دعوت کرد که شبها به خونه شون برم و کتاب بخونیم. خب خیلی از این پیشنهاد خوشحال شدم و استقبال کردم. شب کتاب بادبادک باز رو برداشتم و رفتم . وارد خونه که شدم دیدم یه خونه با دیوارهای کاهگلی که هیچ اتاقی نداره بجز یه پذیرایی که وسطش یه سفره انداخته بودن و هشت نه تا بچه کوچیک داشتن غذا می خوردن. پدر علی که از لباسهاش مشخص بود یه کارگر ساختمونی هست با گرمی خاصی از من استقبال کرد. من تشکر کردم و با علی رفتیم به سمت انباری کوچیکی که گوشه حیاط بود و علی از اون یه جایی برای تنها بودنش درست کرده بود. علی کتاب رو از من گرفت و با شعف خاصی مشغول خوندن شد.. تقریبا یک هفته هر شب این جریان تکرار می شد و ما نیمی از بادبادک باز رو خونده بودیم. علی لابلای صفحه های کتاب برام از افغانستان میگفت از این که چطور بیست نفر با یه سواری وارد ایران شدن ازینکه چطور بچه های کلاس اون رو بخاطر لهجه افغانی مسخره میکنن از این که عصرها بعد از مدرسه مجبوره تووی کارگاه اجر پزی کار کنه. از اینکه پدرش مجبورش میکنه که تابستون تووی سیزده سالگی ازدواج کنه.. بعد علی ادامه داد دلش میخواد نویسنده بشه و جایزه نوبل بگیره. توی اون انباری کوچیک دیدم که شاهنامه و خیام و حافظ و مولوی هم داره.. میگفت حافظ رو از بر داره و خیام رو هم.. و من توی اون نگاهش یه پسر شریف رو می دیدم که خیلی از زمان و محیط خودش جلوتر رفته بود. علی گفت چون توی مدارس دولتی نامنویسی افغانها ممنوعه مجبور شده توی یه دبیرستان خصوصی درس بخونه و حالا خودش و مادرش برای تامین این هزینه مجبورن کار کنن.. هفته بعد که باز سر کلاس رفتم علی رو ندیدم. وقتی پرسیدم بچه ها گفتن که چون پدرش کارت نداشته گرفتنش و همشون رو فرستادن افغانستان. اونقدر ناراحت شدم که دیگه سمت بادبادک باز نرفتم. حتی دیدن کتاب تووی شهرکتابا غمگینم میکرد.. تا اینکه بهار امسال بعد از سه سال پیامی از علی تووی وایبر رسید که روز معلم رو تبریک گفته بود.. نوشته بود با دختری که دوستش داره ازدواج کرده و یک دختر دوماهه داره. نوشته بود حالا در یه کتابفروشی توی کابل کار میکنه و توی این سه سال هزارتا کتاب خونده.نوشته بود ما اینجا تووی کابل اینترنت نسل چهارم داریم. براش نوشتم قراره نسل چهارم بزودی به ایران هم برسه! با رسیدن پیام علی باز تونستم به بادبادک باز نزدیک بشم .کتاب خوبی بود.. مخصوصا برای من یاداور غربت مهاجرای خسته و ناسازگاری روزگار..."

        "user_review": "This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly. Just like the spate of Native American pop fiction in the late eighties, this is overwhelmingly colonized literature, in that it pretends to reveal some aspect of the 'other' culture, but on closer inspection (aside from the occasional tidbit) it is a thoroughly western story, firmly ensconced in the western tradition.Even those tidbits Hosseini gives are of such a vague degree that to be impressed by them, one would have to have almost no knowledge of the history of Afghanistan, nor the cultural conflicts raging there between the Shia and Sunni Muslims, or how it formed asurrogate battlegroundfor Russia and the United States in the Cold War, or forColonial conflictsin the centuries before. Sadly, for all the daily news reports about Afghanistan, most people know very little of its history.Hosseini's story is thickly foreshadowed and wraps up so neatly in the end that the reader will never have to worry about being surprised. Every convenient coincidence that could happen, does happen. He does attempt to bring some excitement to the story with dramatized violence, but that's hardly a replacement for a well-constructed plot. He is also fond of forcing tension by creating a small conflict between two characters and then having them agonize over it for years, despite the fact that it would be easy to fix and the characters have no reason to maintain the conflict. And since the conflict does not grow or change over time, everything is quickly reduced to petty and repetitive reactions.He even creates a cliched 'white devil' character, a literal sociopath (and pedophile) as the symbol for the 'evils' of the Taliban. This creates an odd conflict in the narrative, since one of the main themes is that simple inequalities and pointless conflicts stem from Afghan tradition, itself. His indelicate inclusion of wealthy, beautiful, white power as the source of religious turmoil in the mid-east negates his assertion that the conflicts are caused by small-mindedness.The fact that this character seems to have the depth of motivation of a Disney villain also means that he does not work as a representation of the fundamental causes of colonial inequality, which tend to be economic, not personal. The various mixed messages about the contributors to the ongoing Afghan conflict suggest that Hosseini does not have anything insightful to say about it.Perhaps the worst part about this book is how much it caters to the ignorance of White America. It will allow naive readers to feel better about themselves for feeling sympathy with the larger mid-east conflict, but is also lets them retain a sense of superiority over the Muslims for their 'backwards, classicist, warlike' ways. In short, it supports the condescending, parental view that many Americans already have about the rest of the world. And it does all this without revealing any understanding of the vast and vital economic concerns which make the greater mid-east so vitally important to the future of the world.It is unfortunate that nowhere amongst this book's artfully dramatized violence and alternative praising and demonizing of the West is there the underlying sense of why this conflict is happening, of what put it all into place, and of why it will continue to drag us all down. The point where it could turn sympathy into indignation or realization is simply absent.There is a bad joke on the internet showing a map of the world with the mid-east replaced by a sea-filled crater with the comment 'problem solved'. What this map fails to represent is that there is a reason the Westkeeps meddlingin the affairs of the mid-east, and that every time we do, it creates another conflict--because almost every group who we decry as terrorists now were originally trained and armed by the US and Western powers to serve our economic interests.As long as we see extremists as faceless sociopaths, we can do nothing against them. We must recognize thatnormal people fall down these paths, and that everyone sees himself as being 'in the right'. Who is more right: the Westerner whose careless bomb kills a child, or the Muslim's that does?The point shouldn't be to separate the 'good Muslims' from the 'bad Muslims', because people aren't fundamentally good or bad. They are fundamentally people. Almost without exception, they are looking out for their future, their children, and their communities. Calling someone 'evil' merely means you have ceased to try understanding their point of view, and decided instead to merely hate because it's easier to remain ignorant than to try to understand.This book isn't particularly insightful or well-written, but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers. The problem is that Americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east. This book will make people feel better about themselves, instead of helping them to think better about the world.For an actually insightful, touching view of the Afghan conflict, I would suggest avoiding this bit of naive melodrama and looking up Emmanuel Guibert's'The Photographer'."

It is going to manipulate your emotions. It may include some random words in my native language for no reason whatsoever. It will teach you unnecessary things about my culture. It will not be smarter than a fifth grader. And it will include as many cliches and as much foreshadowing as is humanly possible.You are going to be shocked. I, for one, never saw it coming. So I doubt you will. Get ready. Aren't you so ready to be shocked? You're never going to see this coming.What comes next is the big revelation, so get ready!Wait, I need to ask you something first. Did you know that the Irish like potatoes? Yeah, we really enjoy them. And alcohol too. It's pretty great.Erin Go Bragh!This means Ireland Forever! Unfortunately, you will be very sad to know that my father just died due to an Irish car bomb. Well, about 15 of them to be exact. All on an empty stomach! It makes me sad and you should feel sad too, kind reader.Ok, on to the big reveal. Here it is:On that frigid overcast day, which happened to be the day that I decided to quit readingThe Kite Runner, I became a book snob.BecauseThe Kite Runneris adored by most people who read it, I am forced to conclude that most people need to read more. A whole lot more. You should be embarrassed if you like this book. Seriously. The moment I became a book snob (shortly after \"The Scene\"), I became so embarrassed to be seen reading it that I accused the guy sitting next to me on the subway of putting the book on my lap while I wasn't paying attention. \"How dare you, sir! Have you no decency?\" I exclaimed excitedly in my native language. Then I noticed a monkey on the platform waiting to board a train. I quickly hopped off my train, ran to him, handed him the book, and said \"Top O' the Mornin' to ya!Enjoy!\"Later that day, I saw that monkey flying a kite in front of the Washington Monument. I noticed that the glass string wasn't making his hands bloody. Do you know why? He was wearing gloves.---------------------------------------------------------------Please note that I have absolutely no appreciation for life and reality.**Bart Bondeson, who claims to be \"a better person for having read this book,\"suggestedthat I make this clarification to my review. Thanks for the suggestion, Bart! Hopefully that clears things up for those who were wondering."

        "user_review": "Sad stories make good books.\"I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975.\"There are two types of books, usually, that makes one feel like there are no words to describe the experience: They are either unbelievably detrimental, or exceptionally (and positively) impactful. Given the overall high rating, it is redundant to tell, to which category does The Kite Runner belong. I don't think there are that many books, especially fiction, that could leave such a profound effect on a reader's mind.\"People say that eyes are windows to the soul.\"\"Time can be a greedy thing - sometimes it steals all the details for itself.\"What I loved the most about this book is the set of characters. Hosseini has done an amazing job developing them, which increases the emotional impact of the plot tenfold. Especially, it's remarkable how well he handled the first person protagonist, Amir. The traditional 'do wrong, then atone, conclude with happy ending' is not the way with The Kite Runner, but utilizes an attempt to direct Amir towards a path of atonement, while sticking to a more realistic ending. Had it not been for Hosseini's unique narrative, Amir's character could have turned far more contemptible. Luckily, for me, it was never the case. Many would probably love the secondary characters more, but it is important to remember that it was the protagonist's undistorted, self-criticizing account of the events that made it that way. It's not a perspective you see everyday, but I loved it.\"It always hurts more to have and lose than not have in the first place.\"I was perfectly satisfied with the pace of the story, including the intermittent jumps in time Hosseini used to separate the book in to a few main parts. Each of these parts had their own theme going on, while introducing an occasional twist to keep things interesting. The only minor complaint I have is about the attempt at creating a villain. Even though it introduced a tiny bit of mystery to the plot, that particular part felt a little out of harmony with the rest.\"That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.\"The writing style is somewhat simple, but I believe most readers would be too absorbed in the plot to notice it. If anything, it felt more appropriate, reducing distractions from the flow of the story. But the plot, and the characters make up perfectly for any other shortcoming in my opinion. I wouldn't call this an emotional rollercoaster, for, the majority of the emotions include regret, disappointment, sadness, fear, anger, privation but very little happy ones. But all this helped the book become more moving. I usually don't enjoy books with sad endings but this one was definitely an exception, and worth all the heartbreak.\"Better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.\"Before starting the book, based on almost all the reviews, I knew this was a sad story. But with fiction, if and when things get too depressing, a reader could always be consoled by the fact that this is, after all, fiction. It's easier attributing everything to being not real, and proceed from that safe spot. You're no going to find that solace here. If anything, unless we are fooling ourselves, the severity of reality has been lessened to make it more bearable. But I guess that's the whole point. That's what makes this deliver a profound reading experience. It enables all readers to understand, to empathize, and be considerate towards others. Kite Runner easily made it to my All-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone.'For you, a thousand times over!' he said. Then he smiled his Hassan smile and disappeared around the corner."

Amir desperately wants his father's approval, but Baba is not quick to give it. He is a rich man, brimming with macho vibrancy, while his son is a different sort altogether. Amir is fast friends with Hassan, the son of his father's servant. They are as close as brothers. But, beset by bullies, an event occurs that changes Amir's life. There is much death and horror in this portrait of a tortured country. But there is also emotional richness, and a look into the inner life. By the end of the book there was not a dry eye in the house. It is recommended unreservedly. A wonderful tale, movingly told."

        "user_review": "Two little friends, an unspeakable secret, and a quest for redemption.\"Amir\" and \"Hassan\" are two little boys living in the peaceful Afghanistan of 1975, before the russian invasion, and the subsequent civil wars. Amir is the spoiled son of a wealthy and prominent merchant. Hassan is the cleft lipped son of an inferior caste, and a servant in the house they both live in. During their childhood they become fervent competitors in kite fighting tournaments, and unquestionable friends. Until one fateful day a traumatic event starts gradually separating them forever apart. Decades later, the dark secret that separated them so many years ago starts re-emerging. A secret that ends revealing long forgotten family betrayals, wars, and ethnic differences that led two little inseparable boys into very different life paths.A novel about the inherent strengths and weaknesses in each person, the guilts, and the terrible consequences of trying to endure them, or avoid them.Highly recommendable, very powerful, inexplicably painful. There are books that tell an unique unforgettable story, but there are a few special ones that also have the exceptional quality of transmitting something immensely valuable about the culture of a foreign country; beyond the deeply ideological differences, pros and cons you may find with such society. And, like I hold \"Shantaram\" as an unequalled novel about indian culture, I will hold \"Kite Runner\" as an inestimable novel about afghan. And I remain hopeful of ever finding books like these two, regarding any foreign culture.Few times I suffered so much with a book, but the level of suffering is a good measure of how much you strongly and deeply connected with said book. An infinity of quotes and moments to remember.Still remaining, the movie.-----------------------------------------------PERSONAL NOTE:[2003] [371p] [Historical] [Highly Recommendable][The bathtub scene <\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3]-----------------------------------------------Dos pequeños amigos, un secreto inconfesable, y una cruzada por la redención.Amir y Hassan son dos pequeños niños viviendo en la pacífica Afganistán de 1975, antes de la invasión rusa y las subsiguientes guerras internas. Amir es el hijo mimado de un prominente y rico señor comerciante, Hassan el hijo de labio leporino de una casta inferior y sirviente de la casa en la que ambos viven. Durance la infancia se vuelven fervientes competidores en torneos de lucha de barriletes y amigos incuestionables. Hasta que un fatídico día un hecho traumático termina gradualmente separándolos para siempre. Décadas después, el oscuro secreto que los separó tantos años atrás vuelve a resurgir. Un secreto que termina revelando olvidadas traiciones familiares, guerras y diferencias étnicas que llevó a dos pequeños niños inseparables por muy diferentes caminos de vida.Una novela sobre la fortaleza y la debilidad inherente en cada persona, sobre la culpa, y las terribles consecuencias de tratar de sobrellevarla, o evadirla.Muy recomendable, muy fuerte, inexplicablemente doloroso. Hay libros que cuentan una historia única e inolvidable, pero existen algunos muy especiales que además tienen la excepcional cualidad de trasmitir algo inestimable sobre la cultura de otro país; más allá de las profundas diferencias ideológicas, pros y contras que uno pueda ver en dicha sociedad. Y así como estimo a Shantaram como una novela inigualable sobre la cultura india, tendré a Kite Runner como un fruto inestimable de la cultura afgana. Y me mantengo esperanzado de encontrarme alguna vez con otras novelas como éstas dos, sobre cualquier cultura extranjera.Pocas veces sufrí tanto con un libro, pero la medida del sufrimiento es una buena medida de lo profundamente que conectaste y te llegó determinado libro. Infinindad de frases y momentos para el recuerdo.Queda pendiente la película.-----------------------------------------------NOTA PERSONAL:[2003] [371p] [Histórica] [Altamente Recomendable][La escena de la bañadera <\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3]-----------------------------------------------"

        "user_review": "\"When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing.\"I'm going to be honest with you. To read this book was a constant struggle, not because I didn't like the writing style, not because it was bad and not because it was boring. No, if anything\"The Kite Runner\"was so hard to read because it was so exceptionally painful.This book made me so sad! I felt helpless and angry and there were times I actually was more than just tempted to stop reading. Some of the chapters were just too hard to bear and the book touched me in a way I can't even describe. It did something with me… and I'm still not sure whether this was good or bad.All I know is that the injustice in this book made me furious and that I just have to think about it and already feel sick to my stomach again. There were so many serious topics in this book but I think what really got to me was the central theme of violence, injustice and abuse. To read \"The Kite Runner\" was so devastating and nerve-racking I actually couldn't read more than two chapters a day. It was so upsetting that I found it difficult to motivate myself to read it and even though this was such a painful read, I still wanted to know what would happen next.Amir's and Hassan's story was so horrible, appalling, powerful and beautiful at the same time. It left me completely broken and raw and I think my emotions are still all over the place. So if my review sounds a little incoherent and illogical you can blame it on the book hangover I'm currently suffering from. XD\"But we were kids who had learned to crawl together, and no history, ethnicity, society, or religion was going to change that either.The plot:Amir and Hassan are best friends who grew up together and live in Kabul. They do almost everything together and one of their favourite hobbies is kite running. One day there is a local kite-fighting tournament Amir is determined to win and with the help of Hassan he is even able to achieve his goal. The victory of the tournament comes with a high price though and in the end their moment of happiness isn't only short lived but also comes to an abrupt end. What happens after the competition destroys their lifelong friendship and shakes the foundations of their trust, the course of their lives changing as they try to deal with the repercussions of a single day.\"It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime, Amir,\" he said.The characters:Beware there are plenty of spoilers lying ahead of you!!!Amir:\"I pretended I was reading from the book, flipping pages regularly, but I had abandoned the text altogether, taken over the story, and made up my own. Hassan, of course, was oblivious to this. To him, the words on the page were a scramble of codes, indecipherable, mysterious. Words were secret doorways and I held all the keys.\"Puh, what to say about him? I think I never disliked a protagonist as much as I disliked the narrator of this story. I just couldn't stand his younger self and I thought he wasn't just egoistic but also spoiled and more than just unethical. The way Amir treated Hassan made me sick and his betrayal towards his best friend hurt so much! I mean how could he let this happen? How could he stand aside without intervening? How could he even think that Hassan is \"just a Hazara\"?! I don't understand it and if I'm entirely honest I really think that it was good he felt bad throughout the entire book! His past haunted him and in the end it actually made him a better person. A person that stood up to bad people and a person I was finally able to forgive. It was a long journey for Amir but he eventually did the right thing and when I read the finial sentences of this book I was even proud of him. XD\"It's all right.\" I turned to the general. \"You see, General Sahib, my father slept with his servant's wife. She bore him a son named Hassan. Hassan is dead now. That boy sleeping on the couch is Hassan's son. He's my nephew. That's what you tell people when they ask.\"They were all staring at me.\"And one more thing, General Sahib,\" I said. \"You will never again refer to him as a 'Hazara boy' in my presence. He has a name and it's Sohrab.\"I waited 331 pages for that to happen!!! XDHassan:\"Then Hassan did pick up a pomegranate. He walked toward me. He opened it and crushed it against his own forehead. 'There,' he croaked, red dipping down his face like blood. 'Are you satisfied? Do you feel better?' He turned around and started down the hill.\"God bless his kind and innocent soul!!! This boy was an angel and I don't even know how he was able to forgive Amir. As it seems he managed to do it though and my deep respect and love for his character will never cease. I loved Hassan with all my heart and I think his only flaw was that he was just too good to live in this sick and violent world. He would have deserved so much more than life gave him and when I found out about Sohrab's ordeal I was more than just heartbroken.I was devastated!!!I know Hassan must have turned over in his grave and I felt so, so, so damn sorry for what happened to both of them.Baba:\"The problem, of course, was that Baba saw the world in black and white. You can't love a person who lives that way without fearing him too. Maybe even hating him a little.Baba definitely was a very flawed character but I still couldn't help but had to love him for it. There was so much good in him, yet he also had his bad sides. For a person that was described as seeing the world in black and white he actually was all different kinds of grey and in some way that made him extremely likeable and disagreeable at the same time. *lol* I think he was a very contradictory person and after finding out about his secret I was finally able to understand why. Still, I loved that despite everything he tried to be a righteous man and when it comes down to it he certainly had his heart in the right place.\"Ask him where his shame is.\"They spoke. \"He says this is war. There is no shame in war.\"\"Tell him he's wrong. War doesn't negate decency. It demands it, even more than in times of peace.\"\"And now, fifteen years after I'd buried him, I was learning that Baba had been a thief. And a thief of the worst kind, because the things he'd stolen had been sacred: from me the right to know I had a brother, from Hassan his identity, and from Ali his honor. His nang. His namoos.\"Sohrab:This boyB.R.O.K.Emy heart and I don't even know how I'm supposed to pick up the pieces. He was just ten!! Damn it!! I don't understand how people can hurt children and I can't even… *argharghsdfjklmno* I hate what Assef did to him and I'm so glad Sohrab got away from his clutches! Chapter 22 was so horrible to read… It made me sick to my stomach and I swear I was tempted to throw the book against a wall… Urgh… just to think about his hands on Sohrab… My heart aches so much for that little boy!!! He deserved a better childhood than that! Damn no!! He actually deserved a childhood to begin with!!!!\"I miss Father, and Mother too,\" he croaked. \"And I miss Sasa and Rahim Khan sahib. But sometimes I'm glad they're not … they're not here anymore.\"\"Why?\" I touched his arm. He drew back.\"Because –\" he said, gasping and hitching between sobs, \"because I don't want them to see me… I'm so dirty.\" He sucked in his breath and let it out in a long, wheezy cry. \"I'm so dirty and full of sin.\"And OMG that beautiful ending! That hopeful, amazing and beautiful ending! It killed me, it was the death of me, it was the final nail in my coffin!!! That sweet and gentle and shy boy!!!! XD I already get emotional just thinking about it! *blinking away tears*The bottom line:I hated the book! I loved the book!I hated the injustice, the pain Ali, Hassan and Sohrab had to go through, I hated the way the Taliban treated everyone they considered to be wrong and different, I hated to read about the destruction of Amir's hometown, I hated the violence, I hated the war, I hated to read about the many orphans, the hungry children on the street. I hated the way Amir acted when he was younger!!!\"She had a large purple bruise on her leg for days but what could I do except stand and watch my wife get beaten? If I fought, that dog would have surely put a bullet in me, and gladly! Then what would have happened to my Sohrab?\"But I loved the details about Afghan culture, I admired the bravery of Hassan and Baba, my heart sang whenever they tried to be righteous and good. In a world that had gone to hell they still tried to be decent, they still tried everything possible to stand up for their people, to do the right thing. They still had values and they didn't just believe in them, they also acted according to them!!!So yes, for me\"The Kite Runner\"was a very powerful book. It pushed my boundaries and forced me to fight through it! It made me think about unpleasant things, it forced me to see the bad and ugly things our world is made of, but it also showed me the good in people and their kindness!If you can live with a broken heart and are able to deal with the pain, this book his highly recommended. If you're one of the faint-hearted you better give it a wide berth.As for me, I definitely will never re-read this book ever again! I'm kind of proud that I accomplished to read it though! XD\"For you, a thousand times over.\""

Sometimes incidents you've read are extremely hard to absorb. You want to take a break, closing your book, gathering your composure to return back. The viciousness, unfairness, the tragedies shake you to the core, hurting you deeply as if tiny pieces of glasses are embedded under your skin.I think not any human being in this world can finish this book dry eyed. This is my third rereading and i cannot stop crying!Definitely A MUST READ! Powerful, provocative, dark, sad, heartbreaking, perfectly written! Best work of the author!"

        "user_review": "i really wanted to like this novel. judging from its thousands of 'five-star reviews' hailing it as the one of the 'best books ever written,' i'm in the minority when i state that this novel, while well-intentioned, just left a little bit of sour taste in my mouth.my problems with the novel are as follows: first of all the writing itself is so ham-fistened, heavy-handed, distracting and otherwise puzzling that by the midway point, i seriously considered chucking the book against the wall. each page of the novel has at least 5-10 incomplete sentences. i'm all for experimental and fractered prose--but it's important for authors to use it judiciously. hosseini, unfortunately, beats it to death. a lot of his language is cliched, too, which is funny considering there's a passage in the book about a writing teacher who warns the narrator, amir, about using cliches. i don't know if that was supposed to be funny or not, but it made me laugh (and what was worse was the san francisco's chronicle's glowing review on the book's cover and the san francisco chronicle's glowing review of amir's novel--coincidence?).the author's use of farsi--especially in the dialogue--was equally distracting. my point is that no one speaks the way his characters speak. people don't switch back and forth between languages while speaking, and if they do, they certainly don't speak 1/2 the sentence in english, say one word in farsi, then traslate the farsi word to english, then finish the sentence in english, when they're presumably speaking farsi to begin with. i didn't pick up this book for a crash course in colloquial farsi. after 370 pages, i was frustrated--and annoyed.hosseini's plot often borders on the ridiculous. the'twists' are just TOO coincidental--and not surprising at all (except in how contrived they are). for example, in a devasted kabul, amir sees a homeless man in the street. the homeless man, of course, was a former university professor who just happened to teach with amir's long deceased mother. what a coincidence! what makes it worse, is that the narrator, amir then explains that while that may, in fact, seem like a coincidence, it happens in afghanistan happens all the time. of course it does. in another example, amir's former nemesis, assaf (now a taliban crony), beats up amir and amir ends up with a scar above his lip, just like his dear friend hassan, who was born with cleft-pallet. oh, the coincidence! (and the fact that amir even runs into assef again is ridiculous). another example: amir and his wife aren't able to have children, and of course they find an orphan boy who happens to be extended family and they adopt him. what a coincidence! and after amir returns to afghanistan he doesn't call home to his dutiful wife for over a month. i kept wondering 'when's he gonna call home?' and any plot advanced by a series of 'tragedies,' (and in this book they are legion) shows little more than the writer's inability to craft a meaningful and interesting plot. not only is it pretty poor form, it's also highly manipulative and condescending. i found myself continually frustrated by hosseini's apparent distrust of the reader. we don't have to be told how and when to interpret metaphors. and if i read one more book where the protagonist is a writer or professor, i'm gonna ram my head into a metal post.i don't want to sound like a misanthrope or jaded literature reader because i'm certainly not. this novel just left me wanting so much more in terms of plot and characterization. having said that, however, the novel could be important in that shows the cruelty of the taliban. much of what hosseini writes about is important, especially for us westerners unfamiliar with the breadth and scope of the afghani tragedy.in the end, it was worth the $2.00 i paid for it."

        "user_review": "Abuse, caste system, and invasion long time effectsDescribed in explicit detailThat´s one of the reasons the book first had problems with all audiences, Westerners, and different fractions of the Afghan people. It´s just totally in your face and doesn´t care about genre conventions regarding violence and especially sexual explicitness. The fact that that´s unacceptable in non democratic Afghan parties is understandable. But that first world people had problems with some heavy stuff is one more ridiculous overkill, especially because it uses the described atrocities toDenounce invasions, hierarchies, and sexual abuseThe cruelty of war is the most obvious problem everyone agrees upon, but what about status? No matter if it´s in a feudal medieval state, a caste system, or defined by socioeconomic power and thereby worth, dividing people by giving them different social positions is a game as old as time. And it works so well, everyone high in the ranks will use her/his big influence to concrete this power for eternity and all others are busy fighting to reach the top or just somehow survive. Thereby, they aren´t able to work together and realize the immense influence they could have as united citizens of a country or people of the world, and insteadHelp the 1 percent become even mightierThe Western US and EU model of doing as if there is a democracy and equality, while it´s in reality just an oligarchy of international megacorporations, military industrial complexes, and public private partnerships controlling all governments except for the rare eco social Nordic model ones, is even more ludicrous than pure caste systems. At least they honestly say that they believe in the hereditary, faith fueled, or traditional different worth of people. One of the most disturbing real life manifestations of this is how they deal withStrong sexual predatorsEveryone else is prey and they exactly know that nothing can happen to them. In industrialized countries, there is at least a small chance of a metoo wave and many speaking up after one dared to do so, although victim blaming, slut shaming, and perpetrator protection are often louder than the cries of the rape victims. In caste systems, it´s simply a kind of inherent right of alphas to do whatever their fetish is with everyone else in alphabetic order. All these elements are unitedTo describe the unnatural friendshipOf a high and a low ranking kid of a society. Besides great characterizations, the invasion pimping the plot, a detailed description of the Afghan society, and the mentioned deeper messages, innuendos, and connotations, their life is the essence of this outstanding novel. And there is no room for unrealistic fairytale tropes, happy endings, or justice in a country so grim, gruesome, and sadistic. The essence of the world humans love to create so much withSuperpowers playing chess with weaker nationsNo matter which country in the Southern hemisphere, Middle East, and Central Asia, they are all victims of neocolonialism, sometimes full scale military invasions and occupations, and everything the WTO, World Bank, and IMF throw at them in economic warfare experiments. But guess what, hypocritical and bigoted Europeans and US Americans prefer to be sad about the terrible things described in novels showing the consequences of exploitation, than to realize that their political and economic system is the reason for all the suffering.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "I liked this book a lot. Due to the uncomfortable nature of the story told, I'll probably never read it again, but I'm glad that I did read it once. I saw it as the story of one not very likeable boy growing up in a soon to be war torn region and his eventual struggle for redemption.I was quite surprised to see how popular some of the negative reviews of this book were and I'd like to comment on a few of the comments they contained.One condemnatory critic said \"This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly.\" Ah, if only that were truer. In a study done not long ago, over half of American adult men, when asked, admitted to having read NO books in the last year. Personally, as a white American, this book made me grateful that I grew up where I did, and once again reminded me of how good I've had it, and how little I really know about life outside these insular, isolationist, United States.Another critic claimed that this book \"...portrays Afghanistan as backward\" Personally I thought that it portrayed it as a war torn, deeply wounded country that was at one time a bit like our ante-bellum south. It was made quite clear that we saw pre-soviet Afghanistan through the eyes of a doubly privileged class, the rich child.Another critic claimed \"The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters.\" Yes, that's true. But the viewpoint is a that of an over-privileged, rich, selfish child. Given the ante-bellum south atmosphere that our protagonist sees, it's a wonder that the epithet \"uncle Tom\" wasn't used.Finally one critic complained \"The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban.\" Personally, I felt that while that need may be great, I didn't see that as the purpose of this book.I saw this book as the story of one man's journey toward redemption against a background of a troubled heritage. I sometimes recall doing things as a child that now makes me wonder about myself, and while I like to think I've become a better human being, I sometimes shudder at the savage, thoughtless child that was once under this skin. For the personal perspective alone, I think this book is a worthwhile, if sometimes uncomfortable, read. If you let it, it may make you a better person."

        "user_review": "The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini ( Berliani M. Nugrahani, Translator) is a 2004 Riverhead Books publication.Earlier this year I read Moloka'i by Alan Brennert, another book, like this one, written back in 2004. It seemed I was the only person in the world who had not read the book, and once I'd finished reading it, I wondered why it had taken me so long to read it. This got me to thinking about all the books that I'd intended to read, but never got around to. So, despite my strong feelings about making reading resolutions, I vowed to read more books 'the entire world has read but me'. Other than Moloka'I, I have also read 'The Handmaid's Tale\", and now- \"The Kite Runner\".The Kite Runner has over 68,000 reviews on Goodreads, so I'm not going to recap the synopsis, nor am I going to break down all the various ways in which this book touched me in one way or another, or analyze all the important messages in the story, as I don't think I can add anything more to what has already been said.However, I couldn't simply leave a rating and felt compelled to add a few personal remarks about my experience with this novel- but I'll keep it brief.First of all- why on earth did I wait so long to read this book?This story is an incredible gut-punching- heart-wrenching, powerful and very thought-provoking family saga.The juxtaposition between the two boys and the separate paths on which they embark is tragic, but eventually leads to long overdue penance and justice, as well as redemption and forgiveness. This riveting drama is very reflective, and handled with crisp precision, evoking a myriad of emotions. While the story is deeply depressing and so very sad, it is also an uplifting, inspirational story of a personal reckoning and redemption, which is the part of the story I'll always carry with me.I'm so very glad I took the time to finally sit down and read this book! Although the book is fifteen years old now, it still has the same profound resonance it did when first published. I'm still hugging my box of tissues!Amazing storytelling, amazing book- One I will never forget!"

Still, I will feel that it is not enough.The story of the extraordinary friendship between Amir and Hassan told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan will incontrovertibly move your heart and bring some tears to your eyes. If you are a person who reads only 5-6 books a year, this one should be at the top of your reading list."

        "user_review": "Check out more of my reviews atwww.bookaddicthaven.com'The Kite Runner' had been sitting on my TBR list for years. I kept putting it off because while I was sure that it would be a fantastic book, it isn't the type of smutty romance that I usually read. I knew that I'd have to be in the right kind of mood to read it. Finally, I found myself wanting to read something a little different to break me out of a reading rut and I downloaded the Audible version of 'The Kite Runner' and started listening.As expected, this book was nothing like my usual love stories. This book is the type of book that makes you think about your life and reevaluate your values and what you think you know. It is the type of book that makes you question what you'd do in a given situation if the tables were turned.If you're like me, and have always been blessed to live in a country where you've never experienced the brutality and terror of warfare firsthand, this book serves as a reminder of how lucky you truly are. As a woman, and a mother of two daughters, I cannot begin to express how grateful I am that I was born in a country where women are treated as equals. Sure, there are still some inequalities. However, when I think of how women are treated in many other regions of the world, I am incredibly thankful to have the freedoms that I do.I won't rehash this story, because it's been done a million times already and I don't think there's anything I could say that hasn't been said already. However, I will say that this was a wonderful book. It was grim, brutal and depressing, but also beautiful at times. It was emotional and infuriating, but you can't say that you didn't \"feel\" while reading this one. I experienced a full range of emotions.In the end, it grounded me and put all of my petty gripes into perspective. We all need to be reminded of how blessed we are at times. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an emotional and enlightening story."

Maybe I was more interested in the subject of women's rights in Afghanistan and it made my sympathies with the main characters. I was moved by the women's struggle whereas the story of Amir failed to impress me.I have to be honest. I despised Amir from the first page and my feelings did not changed throughout the book. I know it should not be a reason for not appreciating a book and I agree with that when I read a literature masterpiece such as Hunger, The Trial or Crime and Punishment. However, here is not the case. In Khaled Hosseini books, if you are not touched by the characters, the magic of the book is gone as he manipulates you into feeling in a certain way and cry your eyes out at the end. It worked with A thousand Splendid Suns. No so much here. Maybe the timing was wrong.Even if I hated the MC I still enjoyed Khaled Hosseini writing style."

        "user_review": "I found this book a failure of courage and imagination -- all the more upsetting for the author's astute sense of detail and wonderful psychological depth. But ask yourself this: if the Taliban are real humans than why are they not represented as such? No doubt we will all love the movie as well.If you want to read a book on Afghanistan, I recommend Jason Elliot'sAn Unexpected Light.Below is my complete review:I started out loving this book. Hosseini is dead on target in his depiction of children's psychology, the non-contractual relationships between master and servant, and in his weaving of the threads between trauma, memory, and denial.Further, Hosseini captures the feel of life in a Third World country. His depiction of Afghanistan confirms my own short travels in Afghanistan during the 1970s. Indeed, I was becoming ever more excited with the possibility of teaching this book in my new course on Afghanistan. But alas.The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban. When we do not have an archive, or the possibility of getting at the facts and narratives of a part of history, fiction can be used creatively and responsibly in order to construct something real. Take, for example, the extraordinary slave narrative written by Guy Endore --Babouk. After years of research, Endore writes a history of a slave engaged in rebellion just prior to the Haitian Revolution.Hosseini has the skills but not the courage nor the empathy/sympathy to portray the Taliban as historical, sociological, economic, modern creations. Discounting and trivializing his own skills, he characterizes the Taliban in the easiest way -- as simple, cartoonish, evil. He thereby does nothing to enlighten us. Worse, he panders to a sleepwalking liberal public who happily accept his vision as a seemingly authentic reflection of their own myopia.Most everyone is satisfied: the U.S. public for having read about a country they destroyed -- feeling all the better at having disposed of evil; the publishers for their timely profit; and Hosseini for having expressed his romantic sense of loss.At least V.S. Niapaul is honest about his hatred for his own people. Hosseini's twist is less forgivable -- he gives aide to the very people whose malice, neglect, ignorance, and misunderstanding of Afghan people is one key factor in the destruction of this beautiful land and vital people.A failure of imagination is often the result of a failure in will, in courage, in politics. Hosseini traps himself in the politics of nostalgia.(For a similar review with a more academic bent, please see:http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2..."

        "user_review": "After pondering long and hard, I'm going to try now to articulate just what it was about this book that sucked so much, why it has offended me so greatly, and why its popularity has enraged me even more. This book blew so much that I've been inspired to start my own website of book reviews for non-morons. So let us explore why.First, let's deal with the writer himself. Hosseini's father worked for Western companies while in Afghasnistan. While daddy (who I am guessing, from Hosseini's tragic account of the \"fictional\" father, never accepts his son) worked and got wealthy, normal Afghans lived their lives. When war broke out, Hosseini's father was offered a safe position in Iran. Just before the revolution in Iran, his father was offered another job in Paris, before finally taking the family to the USA.That's fine ... some of us are lucky in life. Others are not. What bothers me, though, is that The Kite Runner is so obviously what Hosseini WISHES had happened.There is no doubt in my mind that the Hassan character really did exist in some form or another. Surely Hosseini had a friend/sometimes playmate/servant who was left behind while Hosseini's powerful family escaped. Surely, Hosseini feels guilty for leaving his homeland by simple privilege while the less fortunate were left behind to fight the Soviets, the Mujahideen, and then the Taliban. And surely, Hosseini wishes he were some flawed hero that didn't simply get lucky. Hewisheshe'd majored in English, as the protagonist does, and published fiction books instead of becoming a run-of-the-mill doctor; hewisheshis father had depended upon him in the USA as happens in the book, instead of getting by just fine as a rich exile with a daddy-doesn't-love-me complex; hewisheshe could go back to Afghanistan, risking his life to make ammends for his shitty and cowardly past, instead of remaining a wealthy outsider living happily in the USA.Hosseini is simply some guy who feels guilty about having escaped what so many of his fellow countrymen couldn't, and he makes up for it in fantasy in a million ways: accepting his fallen father, marrying an \"unsuitable\" woman, listening to a voice from the past, saving the son of his friend he watched being raped decades before (when he was too selfish to intervene), stomaching the live stoning of a burka-clad woman and her adulterous lover, taking a beating from an old enemy/Taliban child molestor, giving $2000 to a poor smuggler who tries to feed his kids on $3 a week, and saving a 12 year-old from suicide. If Hosseini REALLY did all this, what a hero he would be. Instead, he just makes it up and calles it a novel ... and people devour this shit with tears, labeling it as \"inspirational\" and \"moving.\"What really bothers me? Besides all of the contrived and predictable plot twists?? What really disturbs me is that people not only eat this shit up, but they also call it \"literature,\" award it, and give this guy money and license to write another book.For lack of better words ... WTF?!!!??! Has everyone just gone STUPID?!!?!?I could go on about how the writing sucks, especially when the author admits to using cliches (elephant in the room, dark as night, thin as a rake, et fucking c) but I won't.Why? A couple of reasons:1) If you liked this book, a part of you is sick, and a larger part of you is an idiot2) I could write a 100-page thesis about how much this book blew monkey chunks, but it's not worth my time3) This shit sells, and Hosseini, between his stupid book and movie deals, is an even richer man than he was before ... which in the end, makes him smarter than you, me, and everyone else .... He understands the market and fed it back to us. We probably deserve it."

        "user_review": "\"There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood.\"I've read books before with an unreliable narrator and also read accounts of cowardice and shame. Amir, the first-person protagonist and narrator from Hosseini's 2003 novel, filled me with such disgust and loathing that I almost put the book down at 25%.My doctor would say that Amir suffered from AWDD – Ass whooping deficiency disorder and I would enthusiastically second that diagnosis.That said, I invite everyone to read the book and see how it all plays out.\"There is a way to be good again...\"The poet Galway Kinnell once wrote that there are some regrets we can never be rid of. He was right in so many ways. An inability to forgive ourselves for past moments of cowardice, shame and inaction are the most troubling and relentless sorrows we can face as humans wandering around on this poor earth. We can forgive others, even those who have harmed us greatly, but looking ourselves in the eye and offering absolution can be an act beyond so many of us.I took my time getting to this book for a great many reasons and now that I have finally read it, I am so glad. This book moved me. Hosseini was able to pluck heart strings of emotion that I had thought silent and stolid. The themes of loyalty, friendship, devotion countered with betrayal, animosity and selfishness were plaintive notes played out in a literary orchestra of human sentiment.\"I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.\"We follow a distorted tale of mistakes and timidity towards an ultimate chance at redemption. Amir's is an understood but still contemptuous plight of lost opportunity. Shielded by cultural, social and religious privilege, his regrettable acts of pusillanimity are displayed against the heroic and admirable examples of his steadfast friend Hassan and his intrepid father. Hosseini paints us a picture of an evolving and destabilizing Afghanistan, tortured for years with Soviet occupation and then granted only the briefest of reprieves before falling to the theocratic and brutal rule of the Taliban. Amir's journey is one of deliverance and redemption.Hosseini's skill and adept description of a modern day caste system where an invisible division existed between the favored Pashtun and the disadvantaged Hazara may be a tale of Afghanistan, but this abstract and superficial distinction can also be a universal cautionary story about racism, intolerance and bigotry.Beautifully written and told with compassion, empathy and with a skilled writer's eye for detail and expression, this can also be a painful book to read. Not for everyone, but for those who can endure what is at times heartbreaking the reward is as magnificent as is this work.\"For you, a thousand times over\""

        "user_review": "After readingAdventures of Huckleberry Finn, I realized that I had absolutely nothing to say about it. And yet here, as you see, I have elected to say it anyway, and at great length.Reading this novel now, at the age of mumble-mumble, is a bit like arriving at the circus after the tents have been packed, the bearded lady has been depilated, and the funnel cake trailers have been hitched to pick-up trucks and captained, like a formidable vending armada, toward the auburn sunset. All the fun has already been used up, and I'm left behind circumnavigating the islands of elephant dung and getting drunk on Robitussin®. Same story, different day.How exactly did I make it through eight total years of high school and undergraduate studies in English without having read any Mark Twain but a brief (and forgotten) excerpt fromLife on the Mississippi? Isn't this illegal by now? I mean, isn't there a clause in the Patriot Act... an eleventh commandment... a dictate from Xenu? Isn'tHuckleberry Finn, likeRomeo and JulietandTo Kill a Mockingbird, now an unavoidable teenage road bump between rainbow parties and huffing spray paint? Isn't it the role of tedious classic literature to add color and texture to the pettiness of an adolescence circumscribed by status updates, muff shaving, and shooting each other? Or am I old-fashioned?Let's face it. In the greater social consciousness, there are two stars of this book: (1) the word 'nigger' and (2) the Sherwood Schwartz-style ending in which Tom Sawyer reappears and makes even the most casual reader wonder whether he might not be retarded.Huckleberry Finn, for all his white trash pedigree, is actually a pretty smart kid -- the kind of dirty-faced boy you see, in his younger years, in a shopping cart at Wal-Mart, being barked at by a monstrously obese mother in wedgied sweatpants and a stalagmite of a father who sweats tobacco juice and thinks the word 'coloreds' is too P.C. Orbiting the cart, filled with generic cigarette cartons, tabloids, and canned meats, are a half-dozen kids, glazed with spittle and howling like Helen Keller over the water pump, but your eyes return to the small, sad boy sitting in the cart. His gaze, imploring, suggestive of a caged intellect, breaks your heart, so you turn and comparison-shop for chewing gum or breath mints. He is condemned to a very dim horizon, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it, so you might as well buy some Altoids and forget about it...That boy is the spiritual descendant of Huckleberry Finn.The 'nigger' controversy -- is there still one? -- is terribly inconsequential. It almost seems too obvious to point out that this is (a) firstly a 'period novel,' meaning it that occurs at a very specific historical moment at a specific location and (b) secondly a first-person narrative, which is therefore saddled with the language, perspective, and nascent ideologies of its narrator. Should we expect a mostly uneducated, abused adolescent son of a racist alcoholic who is living in the South before the Civil War to have a respectful, intellectually-enlightened perspective toward black people? Should the character of Huck Finn, in other words, be ahistorical, anachronistic? Certainly not, if we expect any semblance of honesty from our national literature.Far more troubling to many critics is the ending ofHuckleberry Finn, when -- by a freakishly literary coincidence -- Huck Finn is mistaken for Tom Sawyer by Tom's relatives, who happen to be holding Jim (the slave on the run) in hopes of collecting a reward from his owners. There are all sorts of contrivances in this scenario -- the likes of which haven't been seen since the golden age ofThree's Company-- which ends with Tom arriving and devising a ridiculously elaborate scheme for rescuing Jim.All in all, the ending didn't bother me as much as it bothered some essayists I've read. That is, it didn't strike me as especially conspicuous in a novel which relies a great deal on narrative implausibility and coincidence. Sure, Tom Sawyer is something of an idiot, as we discover, but in a novel that includes faked deaths and absurd con jobs, his idiocy seems well-placed.In the end, I suppose the greatest thing I can say about this novel is that it left me wondering what happened to Huck Finn. Would his intellect and compassion escape from his circumstances or would he become yet another bigoted, abusive father squiring another brood of dirty, doomed children around a fluorescently-lit Wal-Mart?"

        "user_review": "This is a rant. I found Huckleberry Finn on my bookshelf had been changed to Huckleberry Finn Robotic Edition. Some very pc \"authors\" and \"editors\" took it upon themselves to change the N word to 'robot'. They then rewrote the book to take away any mention of humans and to 'roboticise' words such as 'eye' which becomes something like 'optical device'. The illustrations have also been changed. I have no problem with this, but I do have two major issues with this edition.The first problem is with the librarians who think think this is close enough to the original that it should be combined and therefore share the ratings of Mark Twain's original book. There was a long discussion in the librarian thread where some librarians thought it was essentially the same book, perhaps most. So it was combined and the edition of the book I read was changed to that one. I DID NOT read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Robotic Edition.This robot edition was a Kindle book. Think about it and the danger of these 'authors'. If this is acceptable and it is to a lot of the librarians, why not politically correct Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Agatha Christie (oh she's been done already. It was 10 Little N words, then 10 Little Indians, now it's Then there were 10, lol). Sooner or later print books will be in used bookshops, research libraries and old people's houses. They will become not books to be read but collector's items. For reading it will be the ebook where changes can be easily and instantaneously made.And if politically-correcting everything becomes Amazon policy then the whole publishing world will follow and your children will never know the original story that Mark Twain wrote. They will never understand how N word people were treated and that is my second issue with this pc book.They will never know that Jim, a grown man would not normally be expected to hang out with 13 year old boys, kowtowed to Tom and Huckleberry not just because they all liked each other, but because he was not free, he was a slave, property, and was subject to the usual treatment of property. He could be ordered to do anything no matter how stupid or harmful, he could be sold or mistreated not even for punishment but just because he had no human rights whatsoever.Changing N people to robots negates all this. Yes it is more politically acceptable to Whites but how would a Black person feel having their history taken away from them? This is not pc as much as sanitising history and is wrong on every level. And it was done by the authors to make it easier for White teachers to teach this important book (is it important if it is about robots though?) without engendering awkward discussions about race, slavery, why some people have rights and others are property which has also meant the book is on many 'banned' school lists.Do you find this acceptable? A lot of GR librarians don't see a damn thing wrong with it. But I do.SeeFahrenheit 451edited 27 Jan 2018"

        "user_review": "The ugly face of slavery and racismDescribed in detail by one of the big storytellersTwain just had the intuition and talent to create a milestone of enlightening literature, showing humankind its worst flaws by not moralizing, proselytizing, and thereby boring the audience. Instead, all the atrocities are shown in the actions, mentalities, and especially dialogues of theBigoted and primitive people of that timeThat deem themselves superior, smart, and just sheer Übermensch. Many works against slavery, fascism, extremism, and faith use that storytelling trick of making the hatemongering trolls, the stupid, uneducated antagonistic people of that time, ridiculous in contrast to the progressive, sophisticated protagonists. In the case of Huckleberry FinnEveryone except the protagonist is evilBecause the norms, rules, and laws of the time allow them to be. That´s the subject Twain isn´t directly pointing his finger at, but the underlying core of the tale, that opportunity makes thieves. And a society based on exploitation and brutality creates inhuman, full citizen status subjects with all democratic human rights that treat anyone inferior like an animal and worse than their dogs. That´sA scheme as old as historyAnd Twain digs deeper into it in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Courthttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...He goes above the average evil citizen and describes the ones, kings, god emperors, and faith fueled fanatics, who want this mess to better rule the mad masses. One of the, subjective, main reasons why Huckleberry is so much more successful than the Yankee is that it´s easier to read about bad people doing unfriendly things without directly attacking the system itself. The Yankee does this in a satiric way and is even today just too uncomfortable for people who believe that everything is fine. ThisHumor and irony are the final ingredientsOther great works against slavery are mind opening and well written too, but come with a depressing and hopeless undertone. Twain doesn´t just deliver the important messages, but he does it in combination with creating hilarious dialogues, motivations, and character evolutions that combine deep thoughts and giggles. When first reading Twain as a teenager I didn´t get that, I didn´t see the ingenuity of the whole plot that permanently delivers deep and cynical, postmodern social satire with tons of dark comedy elements.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "Mark Twain tells us the story of Huckleberry Finn and Jim, who attempts to free themselves from society's restraints in this book. The racism aspect of this novel is one of the most discussed and debated topics.The readers will have to encounter the N-word multiple times, which can be difficult for many people. The beauty of this book is that it can be viewed from various angles. The theme of how black and white people work together for their quest for freedom has inspired many people. There are many more layers to this book, including the empathy facet, which is not discussed in depth compared to the racism aspect. It is sad to see some people just considering it as a young adult book discussing racism which just high school children should read. This is unequivocally a true classic that all should read due to the author's exceptional writing skills and multiple embedded themes in it.\"Right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better.\""

        "user_review": "HUCK IL SELVAGGIOIl film più recente è del 1993 diretto da Stephen \"La Mummia\" Sommers. Huck è un giovanissimo Elijah Wood, otto anni prima della Trilogia dell'Anello, e suo padre nella foto è Ron Perlman.Romanzo d'avventure, romanzo di formazione, Huckleberry Finn è forse il Grande Romanzo Americano, come e più di Moby Dick.È così almeno per Hemingway che del libro di Twain scrisse:Tutta la letteratura moderna americana deriva da un libro di Mark Twain intitolato Huckleberry Finn. La scrittura americana arriva da lì. Non c'era mai stato niente del genere prima. E non c'è più stato più niente del genere dopo.Viene infatti da dire che è così almeno nella lingua: ben più 'sporca', ben più quotidiana, 'moderna' e impregnata della terra di quella di Melville.Huck e lo schiavo in fuga Jim.L'avventura c'è eccome, la formazione non saprei, forse no: perché Huck fugge per essere libero, per vivere come vuole, e alla fine è costretto a tornare indietro e rientrare in quella civiltà che rifiuta, dalla quale voleva allontanarsi e separarsi. Alla fine è sconfitto, ma non domo.Me ne stavo all'aria tutto il giorno, felice e contento, fumavo e pescavo e non studiavo mai. Così sono passati un paio di mesi e i miei vestiti sono tornati gli stracci sozzi di sempre, e io non riuscivo più a capire come mai m'era piaciuto dalla vedova, dove bisognava lavarsi, mangiare nel piatto, pettinarsi, andare a letto e alzarsi regolare e starsene sempre con un libro in mano con Miss Watson che rompeva tutto il tempo. Non volevo più tornarci. Avevo smesso di dire parolacce perché alla vedova non gli piaceva, ma adesso avevo ricominciato perché papà non aveva niente in contrario. Lassù nei boschi, tutto sommato, me la spassavo proprio.La versione di Michael \"Casablanca\" Curtiz del 1960. Sulla zattera insiem a Huck e Jim il Duca e il Re.Nella sua fuga il ragazzino naviga per il grande fiume Mississippi ed è istintivo pensare al fiume Congo, a Conrad e il suo Marlow, a quel cuore di tenebra che sembra riverberare in questo lungo e maestoso fiume americano dove anche Huck incontra gente ben selvaggia, più selvaggia di lui stesso.Fa poca differenza se il viaggio di uno è a risalire il corso d'acqua verso la sorgente e il suo cuore nero, quello dell'altro è invece a scendere verso la foce.E quando sull'isola deserta del fiume incontra lo schiavo nero Jim, che è fuggito alle catene, e lo porta con sé sulla zattera, come non pensare a Robinson Crusoe e Venerdì?In un mondo di adulti da evitare, sorta di feccia umana, violenti truffaldini lestofanti oppure bigotti e oppressivi, l'unico adulto che si salva è proprio lo schiavo nero Jim.Nella violenza del padre ubriacone che tiene chiuso e sequestrato il figlio come non ritrovare le figure di padri e tutori e maschi adulti che mettevano i brividi nei romanzi di Dickens?Nel film di Michael Curtiz del 1960 Buster Keaton nella parte di Lion Tamer.Romanzo d'avventura e (forse) di formazione, dicevo: ma anche romanzo picaresco per ragazzi e per adulti, pagine che parlano a grandi e piccini. Romanzo sulla fuga. Sulla libertà.Tom Sawyer, l'amico di sempre e delle altre avventure negli altri romanzi, uno prima e uno dopo questo, è un monello che alla fine accetta la civiltà e impara le regole: non così Huck, che rimane selvaggio – il suo viaggio nella civiltà è in realtà un viaggio attraverso la moderna inciviltà.Nell'edizione originale del 1884 ecco l'incontro tra Huck e Jim.Ci sono ovviamente altri livelli di lettura, meno diretti ai ragazzi e più agli adulti, come si addice a un grande romanzo: Huck mette in scena la sua morte, rinuncia alla sua identità per essere libero, dalla morte nasce la sua vita. E quindi una partenza ben nera.Come nero è Jim, nero il fiume percorso soprattutto di notte sotto le stelle, nero il mondo degli adulti (bianchi), nera la civiltà da cui è meglio tenersi alla larga, fuggire, nera la modernità, a cominciare proprio dagli Stati Uniti. Nera è la morale e nere sono le regole di questi adulti, del loro mondo 'civile' e 'moderno'…Huckleberry Finn in un disegno di E.W. Kemble dell'edizione originale 1884 del libro.È bello vivere su una zattera. Il cielo, lassù, era tutto tempestato di stelle, e noi ci sdraiavamo sulla schiena a guardarle e discutevamo se le aveva fatte qualcuno o se erano capitate lì per caso: Jim pensava che le aveva fatte qualcuno, io invece che erano capitate lì per caso – ci voleva troppo tempo per fare tutte quelle stelle. Jim ha detto che forse le aveva covate la luna, e a me mi sembrava sensato, così non ho detto niente anche perché avevo visto una rana covare altrettanti ranocchi e perciò era possibile. Guardavamo anche le stelle cadenti e le scie che si lasciavano dietro. Jim diceva che erano guaste e così le buttavano fuori dal nido.Huck e Jim sulla zattera, illustrazione dell'edizione del 1884."

        "user_review": "We catched fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed, only a kind of low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ~~ Mark TwainSelected by Kenny McCool for August 2021 Big Book Read (In August I am reading the entireTom & Huck Seriesas well asLife on the Mississippi&Huck Out West)Buddy Read with AesaanRandom thought:The more I readThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnthe more I believe this is my very favorite book. I grow to love it more with each repeated reading.In 1876, Mark Twain began writingThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the sequel to his widely popular novelThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer. After eight years of reworking ~~ and sometimes destroying ~~ the manuscript, the novel was published. Fans of its predecessor were surprised to find thatHuck Finnwas not the romantic depiction of southern boyhood thatTom Sawyerwas. Instead, the novel was a realistic look at the hypocrisy and senselessness of southern society.Huck Finntells the story of a young boy searching for freedom and identity in this backwards society.It's hard for many Americans to accept a simple truth ~~ American history is not always pretty. There are atrocities we don't like to be reminded of. For over 135 years,Mark Twain'sThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnhas held up that mirror and challenged us to examine our souls. WhenHuck Finnwas first introduced inThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, he was Tom's untamed friend, the one who was always ready to play hooky and look for pirate treasure; the friend Tom could always trust to follow him without question. In his own story, Huck takes over as narrator with his distinctive voice, sharing with the reader not only his escapades since fleeing his abusive father, but also his growing philosophy about slavery and the changing country around him.In many waysHuckleberry Finnis the story ofJim, the runaway slave who accompanies Huck on his adventures, as much as it is Huck's story. A complicated character, Jim goes from silly to tragic, sometimes even within the same paragraph. He dreams of freedom, not just for himself but for his wife and children, sharing with Huck his desire to purchase each of them back ~~ and if he can't buy them back, he'll steal them. To help emphasize the heartbreak of Jim's plight, Huck witnesses a family split up by a slave auction. Those around Huck are upset by it too, and their inaction speaks volumes.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnhas been one of the most banned books in America. From complaints about its use of foul language and stereotypes, to being a bad influence on children, this book has never escaped controversy. While re-reading it again this go around, I wondered who exactly didTwainpicture as his audience. Sometimes it feels like a young boy's adventure, others it reads as a dour tale for adults. Yes, Huck dresses up like a girl and gets in comic misadventures, but this is more a novel about slavery, beatings, child abuse, alcoholism and murder. Huck's America, much like 45's America, is not a friendly one.Viewing the novel as merely a contemporary tale ofTwain'stime, it is masterful how he handles Jim for that reader. Twain begins by hitting all of the stereotypes Americans of that period would have expected, then he builds on the character until he emerges as a hero, sacrificing his freedom to carry an injured white boy to safety. It is a subtle and brilliant statement against racism and for equality.Lastly,Huckleberry Finnis a book about transitions. These transitions can be seen in the intermediate setting between transitions in which the novel takes place, Huck's disenchantment with society over the course of the novel, and Huck's moral maturation.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnis filled with all sorts of transitions for Huck. Throughout the entire novel, Huck is in a state of Limbo. He's fourteen years old, an awkward stage after childhood and before adulthood ~~ in the throes of puberty, while he's floating down the Mississippi River, the boundary between individual freedom and an immature civilization. Huck transitions from a boy being civilized in St. Petersburg, Missouri, to a young man completely disenchanted with society. Finally, he transitions from being indoctrinated by southern morality to accepting his own individual morals and heading off to free Jim. Huck is constantly changing over the course of the novel. He starts out as the immature Missouri boy playing jokes on slaves, but by the end he is an enlightened young man ready to head west to a better tomorrow. Huckleberry Finn is the future of America.Update 2022: I just completed my annual reading. I love the character of Huck so much.Update 2023: It's amazing all the little things I picked up with this read. Twain is so good."

        "user_review": "\"Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.\"Like many, I've read this book when I was a kid (twice actually, as a kid and a teen), and this was the first time I revisited it as a (hopefully) fully functional adult. And this time my reactions to it were quite magnified. The parts I liked before I loved now, and the parts that irked me in childhood now irritated the living daylights out of me.Huckleberry Finnis a classic, and about half of it deserves that designation. Those are the parts where Twain shines — the parts with the mesmerizing and majestic Mississippi river, the ability to write injustice and abuse without proselytizing and falling into \"misery porn\" trap, and the sharp observation of the folks of the rural American South.\"We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed – only a little kind of a low chuckle.\"And then there are the parts when severe tonal dissonance kicks in and the whiplash of being in another book sets in. It first starts with a bit of annoyance in those endless \"king\" and \"duke\" chapters, but peaks at impressive rate once Tom Sawyer and his hijinks pop up. Tom Sawyer, who belongs in a kids book at best, whose overactive imagination in this situation is no longer cute but dangerous and cruel and incredibly thoughtless — and almost physically painful. (Yes, I know Tom Sawyer is supposed to come across as ridiculous here, but it went on for way too long).Oh, and how bleak and pointlessly violent was the world of rural American South of the 1830? Sometimes I wonder if humanity really deserves to continue on. Yes, there are quite a few funny parts (Huck's rant about Henry VIII many \"achievements\" - from Domesday book to malmsey wine drowning to Boston Tea Party comes to mind*), but my overall take this time is of resolutely grim life. Slavery, violence, alcoholism, cruelty, ignorance, disregard for rights of others - I need to stare at the wall for a little while now.* My favorite rant here, under spoiler tag for brevity sake:\"My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off. 'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'—and they chop it off. 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.\"Being a novel of its time it doesn't go where I wish it did, but even classics belong to their time, and this one is not an exception. And people needed to start like Huck — deciding that\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\"— because you have to start somewhere.3.5 stars, and my brain is busily editing Tom Sawyer out of this story).————Buddy read with Nastya.——————Also posted onmy blog."

        "user_review": "I first read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn when I was in high school. I don't remember if it was the full book or an abridged version in a textbook.I only remembered three things about the book.1. The Explanatory statement at the beginning of the book where Twain talks about dialects and such.2. Huckleberry and Jim floating down the Mississippi River on a raft. (I definitely didn't remember how their adventure started or ended.)3. I also remembered that Huck and others frequently used the N-word. (I didn't remember that they used the N-word 219 times!)I reread Huck Finn by listening to the first thirty-two chapters of an audio book narrated by Elijah Wood. Then I read chapters thirty-three through forty-three using a text-based digital copy of the book I obtained from my local library. I started with an audio book because I wanted to get a feel for the various dialects.I almost quit the book early on because I found the use of the N-word so offensive. I decided to continue reading the book after I read the PEN America essay titled Here's Why Banning 'Huck Finn' Over The N-Word Sends The Wrong Message.Huck Finn deals with serious topics such as slavery, child abuse, the flim-flamery we now call \"white\" crime, and the importance of personal loyalty and integrity. The book starts and ends like a humorous YA adventure but like a four star restaurant there's some serious meat and potatoes between the appetizer and dessert.I do have to admit I found the comedic shtick between Tom Sawyer, Huck, and Jim to be tedious. I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages, and finally chapters. Tom Sawyer seems to represent America's long standing bias against \"intellectural\" people. Tom reminded me of all the clever know-it-alls who do their own research during a pandemic. Tom and Huck express America's bias against deductive reasoning and its favorable view of \"common sense\"."

A question I have had to ask myself repeatedly over the last few days, after students in Grade 8 received the task to come to the library and \"check out a classic to read\". There was a list with the usual suggestions, but students ventured out and started to explore shelves, and then came to me with a wide range of books, repeating the question:\"Is this a classic?\"Why did I turn down the diary of a wimpy kid, they wanted to know, and accept Huckleberry Finn, even though it was so much harder to understand, and also, they had heard it was racist?All good questions, and I was careful not to give a too categorical answer. The last thing I wanted was for them to make the connotation that a classic is a boring must, while a \"good book\" is what the teachers and librarians would refuse.Difficult.I found myself talking about the Count of Monte Cristo and Voldemort, about Tom Sawyer and Oliver Twist in comparison to Harry Potter, and I made a case for trying to get through parts of Huckleberry Finn even though the language is challenging, mainly because it contains exactly the message that people become unfair \"when they don't know nothing about it\".I found myself talking about discovering other times, other societies, other ideas of justice and hierarchy, and I talked about living in the mind of someone other than oneself. Imagine Huckleberry on that raft on the Mississippi, I said. Imagine him being in a conflict between the values he was taught and the humanity he discovered together with his fellow human, who happened to be a black man in distress. Which concept of life would be stronger?Imagine a situation in which you would have to make a choice between what you are taught and what you perceive?\"That's interesting\", a student said.Another one replied:\"Yeah, but it really is racist too!\"And I thought:\"That makes a classic. A book that can still inspire discussions in a school library some 135 years after its initial publication.\"So, dear Harry, I hope that in the year 2133, some librarian will tell students that you are a classic hero, still worthy of their attention, even though your worldview may seem a bit dated and out of touch with their perception of reality! And just imagine all the Voldemorts we will have had to fight to make sure there are still school libraries and reading kids by then!To Huck and Harry!"

        "user_review": "NOTICEPERSONS attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.BY ORDER OF THE AUTHOR...Jim said that bees won't sting idiots, but I didn't believe that, because I tried them lots of times myself and they wouldn't sting me....Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnopens in the aftermath ofThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and for a time, it has the same joyous feel as the boys continue their antics of rebellious 12-year-olds. But the return of Huck Finn's drunk of a father, Pap, hints at the darker, more serious themes of this novel. After being kidnapped and beaten, Huck escapes his father by faking his own death and then going on the run. He soon crosses paths with a runaway slave, Jim, and together they raft their way down the Mississippi.Like its predecessor,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnis largely a series of vignettes with a very loose overarching plot. Huck and Jim travel from Missouri through Kentucky and Arkansas and into the antebellum South, getting into scrapes and making escapes along the way. There's some great humor in their conversations on the raft; their argument about the wisdom of King Solomon is priceless. And there's classic Twain satire and exposing of hypocrisy here, from the feuding Grangerford and Shepardson families to the con men known as the Duke and the King.So why was I reading this classic novel during Banned Books Week? For that, we have to talk about race and racism. The characters here (and the author, for that matter) are products of their 19th century time. The n-word is used relentlessly in this book, even by the slaves themselves, and it is jarring. Huck says casually racist things here that are heartbreakingly awful; on one occasion, for example, he compliments Jim by thinking \"I knowed he was white inside.\" And some critics fairly read this book as irredeemably problematic, reinforcing racist stereotypes and repeatedly deriving humor from a variation of a minstrel show.But I come down on the side of those who readThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnas transcending and challenging the racist stereotypes of the time. Huck has been taught by society all his life to view blacks as slaves, as less than. And at a pivotal moment, he writes a letter to report where Jim can be found by his master, and at first he thinks the letter is the right thing to do:I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\"All right, then, I'llgoto hell\"—and tore it up.Huck says the wrong thing, and uses racist language, again and again throughout this book. But he ultimately recognizes and acts on his and Jim's shared humanity and equality. That might be the best we can realistically expect from a book published in the 1880s. And some days, it's obvious that our society has not come nearly as far on this score as we'd like to think we have.IsThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinntheGreat American Novel? It's written by an immortal, epically talented writer. It was one of the first books to truly capture the course, plain spoken language of its time. And by focusing on racism and slavery, it speaks to America's original sin. So yeah, it just might be, even though I preferTo Kill a Mockingbird. Highly recommended."

        "user_review": "I had mixed feelings about this book.On the one hand, it's clear that Mark Twain was progressive for his day, satirizing the topsy-turvy morals of the slavery-era south. His heroes are two people at the bottom rung of the social ladder - a runaway slave, and the son of the town drunk. Though they're not valued by society, they turn out to be the two most honorable characters of the book. And I appreciated the questions it raised, about how we construct our own sense of morality in the context of broader social morals, and how we deal with potential conflicts between those two. I loved Huck for choosing to go to hell rather than turn in his friend.On the other hand, it's such a far-fetched farce, with so many over-the-top scenes, one crazy situation after another, so many coincidences, such silliness, that I had a hard time enjoying it. At the end, Tom keeps adding all kinds of superfluous details into the escape plan, just to satisfy his sense of drama. The author seems to think this will be amusing - see how it's a funny game to Tom, see how he's influenced by all the adventure books he's ever read... And I just wanted to smack the kid, and say, \"A man's life is in danger! How dare you treat this like a game of make-believe! Just get him out of there, you idiot!\"The humor reminded me a lot of Candide. That style (social satire, ironic farce, fable, whatever you want to call it) can be a great way to make a point. But it's not the same as a novel with well-developed characters and a realistic plot.Sometimes I enjoy satire, but yesterday, I just wasn't in the mood. I felt like the atrocities committed in our country against African-Americans were just too horrific to laugh at.I have heard that people often protest this book when it appears on school curricula, because of the repeated use of the n-word. I think I had an easier time accepting that word, because it reflected the common usage of the time, and it felt like part of the natural, authentic voice of the narrator. I had a harder time with the portrayal of Jim as a naive, superstitious, gullible, person, who seems completely dependent on a young white boy to figure out what to do. Jim is good, but he doesn't come across as particularly smart. He's more an archetype - the noble savage - than a real person.I think the main value of this book is as a historical artifact. You can see the important role it played if you look at what it was for the time it was written in, and how it influenced other books written in America. But I don't think it could get published today. I'm glad to say, we've come a long way."

        "user_review": "Why have I never readAdventures Of Huckleberry Finnbefore? Was it Twain's copious use of the N word? (I vaguely recall a primary school teacher abruptly halting a class read-aloud session, perhaps because of that.) Was it the air of earnest solemnity that surrounds so-called classics? Sheer laziness?No matter. I've read it now, and I'll never be the same again. Hemingway was right when he said (and I'm paraphrasing) all American literature comes from Huck Finn. While it'd be entertaining to read as a kid, it's even more rewarding to approach as an adult.Savour that wonderful opening paragraph (and tell me you can't hear Holden Caulfield in the cadences):You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly – Tom's Aunt Polly, she is – and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.Everything to come is in those opening lines, penned in that distinct, nearly illiterate yet crudely poetic voice. You get a sense of Huck's humility (compared to Tom Sawyer's braggadocio); his intelligence; a cute postmodern nod to the author; the idea that storytelling contains \"stretchers\" but can also tell \"the truth\"; and the fact that everyone lies, including Huck.EspeciallyHuck. He gets into so many tight spots that part of the joy is wondering how he'll get out of them.The outlines of the plot should be familiar: Huck, a scrappy, barely literate boy, flees his abusive, alcoholic father by faking his death and travelling the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with Jim, an escaped slave, on a raft.Huck's gradual awakening to Jim's plight is subtle and touching, never sentimental. In a sense the book chronicles his growing conscience. And the colourful characters he and Jim meet and the adventures they have add up to a fascinating, at times disturbing look at a conflicted, pre-Civil War nation.We meet a Hatfields vs. McCoys type situation; a group of rapscallions who put on a vaudeville-style act and try to fleece rubes; a scene of desperation and danger on a collapsed boat. We witness greed, anger and most of the other deadly sins – all from a little raft on the Mississipi. And before the midway point, we see the toll that a cruel joke can have on someone's feelings.To a contemporary reader, some of the humour can feel a little forced, and the gags do get repetitive, particularly when Huck's savvier, better-read friend Tom enters the scene.And then comes a passage like this:When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sun-shiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits whispering – spirits that's been dead ever so many years – and you always think they're talking about YOU.Wow. You can see, hear andfeelwhat he's describing. Hard to believe this was written more than 150 years ago.In the book's closing pages, Huck tells us this:If I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.Well, gosh, Huck, it war worth all yer trouble. We're darn glad you dunnit. Yessir."

        "user_review": "I had to readThe Adventures of Tom Sawyerin middle school, and I fervently wish that they had made us readHuck Finninstead. I mean, I understand why they didn't (giving middle schoolers an excuse to throw around racial slurs in a classroom setting is just asking for a lawsuit from somebody's parents), butHuck Finnis better. It's smarter, it's funnier, and Huck's adventures stay with you a lot longer than Tom's, because Huck's experiences were richer and more interesting, whereasThe Adventures of Tom Sawyercould easily have been titledThe Adventures of an Entitled Little Asshole.If Tom had to go through half of what happens to Huck in this story, he'd be balled up in the corner crying after five minutes. The action ofHuck Finnis set in motion when Huck's father shows up and decides that he's going to be responsible for his son now (the story picks up right whereTom Sawyerleft off, with Huck and Tom becoming rich, hence Finn Sr.'s sudden involvement in his kid's life). Huck's father essentially kidnaps him, taking him to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and getting drunk and beating his son. Huck escapes by faking his own death (and it'sawesome) and begins traveling up the Mississippi river. He runs into Jim, a slave who belonged to the Widow Douglas's sister. Jim overheard his owner talking about selling him, so he decided to run away and try to go north. Huck, after some hesitation, goes with him. From this point, the structure of the book closely mirrorsDon Quixote: a mismatched pair of companions travels the country, having unrelated adventures and comic intervals. On their travels, Huck and Jim encounter con men, criminals, slave traders, and (in the best mini-story in the book) a family involved in a Hatfields-and-McCoys-like feud with a neighboring clan. The story comes full circle when Tom Sawyer shows up and joins Jim and Huck for the last of their adventures, and the best part of this is that Tom Sawyer's overall ridiculousness becomes obvious once we see him through Huck's eyes.Huck is a great narrator, and I think one of the reasons I liked this book more than its counterpart was because it's narrated in first person, and so Huck's voice is able to come through clearly in every word. In addition to the great stories, there are also some really beautiful descriptions of the Mississippi river, as seen in this passage about the sun rising on the river:\"The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line - that was the woods on t'other side - you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness, spreading around; then the river softened up, away off, and warn't black any more, but grey; you could see little dark spots drifting along, ever so far away - trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks - rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking, or jumbled up voices; it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin on the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of the river, being a wood-yard, likely, and pulled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh, and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\"(also that was one single sentence. Damn, Mark Twain.)A fun, deceptively light series of stories that's funny and sad when you least expect it. Well done, The List - you picked a good one, for once....why are you still here? The review's over.Oh, I get it. You want me to talk about the racism, right? You want me to discuss how Huck views Jim as stolen property instead of a person and criticize the frequent use of the N-Word and say \"problematic\" a lot, right?Well, tough titties. I'm not getting involved in that, because it's stupid and pointless, and I'm just going to let Mark Twain's introduction toThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnspeak for itself, and the work as a whole: \"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\""

        "user_review": "One of my absolute favourite books, which I have read multiple times. A major classic. If at all possible, get an edition with the original illustrations.___________________________________(Expanded review based on conversation withJORDAN)Here in Switzerland,l'affaire du mot Nhasn't quite had the high profile it's received on its home territory. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that I hadn't even heard of it until Jordan gave me a few pointers earlier today. So, no doubt all this has been said before, but I still can't resist the temptation to add my two centimes worth.In case you're as ignorant as I was about hot topics in the literary world, the furore concerns an edition ofHuckleberry Finnin which the word 'nigger' has been systematically replaced with 'slave'. My initial response was plain surprise. One of the aspects of the book I enjoy most is Twain's appallingly exact ear for dialogue. He's reproducing the language actually used in the American South of the 1840s, and this, above all, is what gives the novel its force; so why on earth would anyone want to change it? For example, here's Huck's Paw in full flow:\"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me -- I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold? -- that's what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now -- that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger.I'm sorry, but I'm honestly unable to see how anyone could think the above passage was racist or might be improved by substituting 'slave' for 'nigger'. It's incidents like this which create the popular European myth that Americans don't understand the concept of irony.If you're curious to know more about the tradition of improving great works of literature by removing dubious words, you might want to take a quick look atthe Wikipedia article on Thomas Bowdlerwhich Jordan and I were giggling over. Bowdler, it turns out, had acted from the best of motives. When he was young, his father had entertained him by reading aloud from Shakespeare; butLater, Bowdler realised his father had been extemporaneously omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. Bowdler felt it would be worthwhile to present an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not a sufficiently \"circumspect and judicious reader\" to accomplish this expurgation himself.He undertook to create a suitably amended version. Or, to be exact, he got his sister to do it and then gave out the books under his own name. Again, his reasons were unimpeachable: it would have reflected badly on her to admit that she had understood the naughtier passages.I won't criticise Dr Bowdler or his equally well-meaning modern followers. I just think it's a shame Mark Twain never had the opportunity to write a story about them."

        "user_review": "THE Greatest American Novel?Well...No wonder the Spanish think themselves intellectually/culturally superior with their Quixote, undoubtedly a blueprint for this mischievous Every Boy! Huck Finn is the full embodiment of THE American Fantasy: mainly that dire misconception that the protagonist of the world is you and that everything gravitates around that essential nucleus. Everyone in town thinks Huck dead, and what does he do but follow the tradition of a plot folding unto itself (as Don Q finds his story become medieval pop culture in Part II of that superior novel) as he disguises himself as a little girl and tries to squeeze information out of some lady about his myth-in-the-making trek. It seems everyone cares for this vagrant, a perpetual Sancho P to Tom Sawyer's Quixote, whose redeemable features include (a pre-transcendental) openmindedness and an inclination to live only in the NOW. But the narrator, a very unreliable one at that, surrounds himself with bad bad men, playing the role of accomplice often, always safe and sound under the dragon's wing. Very American in his lemming mentality & in his misconceptions (though about his hometown and wilderness he knows much indeed).So: disguise used as an integral plot device several times throughout; brawny men taking a boy hostage; nakedness by the riverbed; costume changes, improvised Shakespearean shows, men almost always described as \"beautiful\" (and women solely as \"lovely\")....***GAY!!***Yeah, it really is hard to discern the allegory behind all of this hype. The humor is obvious, but I have to admit that this picaresque novel about a boy who avoids \"sivilization\" at all costs is beaten mercilessly by a more modern, therefore more RELEVANT tale of the South, \"Confederacy of Dunces.\" Although it must be admitted that \"Huck Finn\" does manage to surpass other often-praised classics, like the droll \"Wuthering Heights.\""

        "user_review": "Pretty good, kinda silly - but I think that is what Twain was going for - 3.5 stars.Twain is the king of the Yarn. Huckleberry Finn is a collection of outlandish tales all with lies and trickery at their heart. At the time of its release I am sure it became a bible for scoundrels and mischevious teens.This book is controversial, and even frequently banned, because of its portrayal of black slaves and the use of the N-word. I venture into shaky ground here by offering my opinion as I am white, but I don't think I will cause too much trouble. I can accept that at the time of writing the words and language were fairly normal so as a time period piece it is true. However, I can't say I have read a book that takes place in that time period that so flippantly tosses the n-word around. Regarding banning of this book - I can definitely tell why some parents might be concerned about their kids reading this book. I think a lot of it depends on how it is being taught - I would hope the teacher would put an emphasis on explaining the language being used.Summary:- A good book- Kind of silly- A handbook for deception- An understandably controversial reflection of the prejudices at the time it was written- Some may need guidance regarding the the way racial differences are portrayed in this book."

        "user_review": "\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\" --This is Huck's decision, rather than turn in his friend, Jim. They had been through many things together.Here's the story....Huck faked his death and ran away from his drunken father. On Jackson's Island, in the middle of the Mississippi River, Huck encounters Jim, a runaway slave and his friend. Jim fled because he overheard his owner, Miss Watson, planning to sell him to a plantation. Huck and Jim ultimately must escape the island because their campfire is spotted.Later in their adventures Huck reports...I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:'Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.'I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell.And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind.I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\" -- and tore it up.'Huck's epiphany is that Jim is a human being, no matter what people call him or how they treat him, and Huck is willing to risk his soul to help him.===========I don't listen to many audiobooks, but if you like them may I suggest the brilliantly narrated version by Elijah Wood. He captures the colloquial speech brilliantly in a way I never got from the written page.https://itunes.apple.com/us/audiobook..."

Apart from the names, there is no other similarity between the two.I was baffled by the style of writing. It was different. The tone was different too. I enjoyed reading about Huckleberry Finn more than Tom Sawyer.If you happen to be one who's always in the hunt of character development while picking a book. Sadly, this one might not be the one for you. I for one couldn't find any difference in Huckleberry Finn from start to end, as far as character is concerned. He remains the same throughout the story.This book has racism, misogyny and bad parenting behaviour. So look out for those while you decide to read it.Review Posted: 21 May 2022.VisitMy Blogto read this and all my other reviews."

        "user_review": "I knows I's gywne teh like tis bookA delightfully funny and nostalgic piece of writing. This is my first Mark Twain and it will most certainly not be my last.Secondhand NostalgiaAlthough my grandfather grew up in the 1940s and not 1840s, there is an undeniable similarity in their childhoods. Both by grandfather and Huck are masterful storytellers who convey a tenable sense of freedom - stories that elicit nostalgia in me although I have not experienced them myself. Both convey a time that was simpler, and yet in many ways infinitely more complex than our own.Mark's a funny guyI believe that the relationship between Huck and Jim is very well executed. It is not simple. A major theme of the novel is that Huck's religious and societal beliefs (going to hell for helping an escaped slave) and his moral beliefs (that helping a slave is the right thing to do) clash. The way in which Twain portrays this clash is not only masterful, but shrouded in humour as Twain is wont to do. What I adore about Twain's humour is that it is still relevant and funny more than 100 years later.Old kids on the BlockI also feel that Twain writes children very well. I could immediately relate to Huck's out-of-the-box thinking and Tom's outrageous answers to solving problems. Twain reminds us that although Huck is faced with immense challenges that question his moral fibre and very place in society, he is just a kid. Mark has a penchant for writing child characters as well as Stephen King.Hobbit's got a voiceThe conversations between Jim and Huck had me crying with laughter. This was enhanced by Elijah Woods' narration of the audio book. His intonation, emphasis and accents were all well-timed and well-executed. This hobbit did good.Racism and Huck FinnWhat I find interesting about this book is that it was initially banned for being too liberal and pro-black. Several decades later, it is considered racist and slandering. I will not comment on this - only that it reveals a lot about how a society develops. Always take a classic with a grain of salt. Misogyny and racism are an inevitability in many classics and should be taken as a period piece and not a criticism for social justice. Jim's also the result of the times - he may seem a caricature, but I feel that we won't do Jim justice if we don't look at his situation as well as his deep meanderings on life that are often masked as humour and satire.The only reason I did not give Huck Finn 5 stars is that the book degraded in quality by the last quarter. I felt that it was being drawn out and forced by then.All round, Huck Finn is a solid classic and I'll be happy to return to Huck's world when I read Tom Sawyer."

        "user_review": "I have re-read Huckleberry Finn after more than 30 years and I must say that I did not remember it at all like that. Another of those books that are read by children believing that they are children's books and that then when they re-read as adults they have unexpected feelings. There are all the emotions of the great American novels of the past, that is, the discovery, the journey, going beyond both geographical and psychological borders, the vastness of America, freedom, everything. If you read it as a boy you like it; if you read it as an adult, you like it even more. It is a book on nonconformism, on the choice (possible but not obvious) to go against the current, not to do what others would like us to do. In some Twain biographies it is said that to write Huckleberry Finn he was inspired by his childhood friend, a boy who lived in a shack on the banks of the Mississippi. A boy out of limits, who did not go to school, did not work and spent his time fishing or hunting in the woods, refractory to all the rules to which all the others had to comply. In the book, Huckleberry Finn is a motherless boy with an abusive and alcoholic father. Huckleberry smokes, says bad words, does only what he likes and is not afraid of anything or anyone. When he and Tom Sawyer (the one from Twain's other book, of which this is the continuation) share the bandits' treasure, they become rich, which is why Huckleberry, abandoned by his alcoholic father, is adopted by Mrs. Douglas, a bigoted widow. After a while, Huck decides to escape from the widow's house, who had set herself the goal of civilizing Huck, teaching him education, reading the Bible and sending him to school. To escape, he uses a raft found on the Mississippi embankment and begins his journey with Jim, a black slave, who has fled his mistress who wanted to sell it. The Mississippi is described very well with its storms, its mists, its silences, its beauty, but the journey of the two is also full of pitfalls, such as when, for example, they meet a couple of scammers, who with various expedients manage to sell Jim to Tom's aunt's sister. The story then continues with Huckleberry and Tom trying to free Jim, while in the meantime Huckleberry and Jim are wanted by the police who want to recapture the black fugitive. After many attempts the two companions finally manage to free Jim. At the end of this trip Huckleberry is informed of the death of his father and plans to leave with his companions for a thousand other adventures, starting with the Indian Territories.The book is very pleasantly read and, despite being a classic, it is still very current, proving, if needed, that Twain was a Great. In his journey, Huckleberry will learn to distinguish good from evil and will understand, among great difficulties, values such as solidarity and equality between men. A very readable, fun, but also profound book: during their escape Huck and Jim live the greatest and most beautiful adventures they can imagine, under the banner of the American dream of freedom. Huck and Jim embody this dream, while all the other protagonists of the book represent the \"pigeonholed\" or the negative, that is, the bigots, the greedy, the boring, the hateful. If the little reader recognizes the protagonist of the book in Huck, the adult reader will find that the most important figure is Jim, the black, the slave, the human refusal, or better, what society does not even consider a human being. Instead he is the only real man in the novel. The rebellious boy and the escaping slave: two to whom nobody would give two cents. Yet these two, in the nights spent on the river looking at the stars, ask themselves the same questions that the great philosophers ask themselves: they wonder (and ask us) about freedom, about the stars of heaven, about the existence of God. Does it seem little to you?"

        "user_review": "3rd Review- August 2022I readFrankensteinfor a sixth time this week. Although it is one of my favourite novels, and in my opinion one of the finest pieces of fiction ever written, I find myself with a new appreciation of the text every time I come to it.A large proportion of one of my PhD chapters is about this novel. I'm discussing the idea of the vegetable diet along with purity and becoming our natural selves. And I'm also considering notions of animal rights, of the idea that man is very much an animal too and he has lost this sense of original self.Frankensteinat its very core is a novel about duality, of our capability to be both good and evil and to be both human and animal.There is so much to take from this book and there's so much that be taken apart, scrutinised and then put back together again. What's truly striking about the work is how much is reflects the anxieties of the age. It's full of insecurities about nature, god, science and our place in the world. Ultimately, it is a novel that creates a sense of unease because it highlights so much about the inauthentic nature of the lives many of us live. Running through the novel is a craving for freedom: a craving to to simply exist in a natural way.2nd Review- January 2020Some books teach you something new each time you revisit them.I picked up the tragically wonderfulFrankensteinfor a fifth time this week, and I was totally mesmerised by the descriptive language used to describe the natural world.In all my previous readings, I focused on all the classic tropes of man and monster though I never considered the importance of the serene beauty that surrounds the story. The natural world dominates the background of the novel. It's there, like a pervading monster that lingers in the darkest reaches of the mind.What struck me most about it was the fact that both Victor and his creation long for a real life, a life where one is truly alive. And they both ponder what this means at length, reaching the same conclusion: to go completely nomad. They both wish to live a life free of burden and complications, no money, no commitments and no responsibility. They just want to be totally free in the wilderness with the ultimate goal of finding happiness by looking after their most immediate and natural desires.And for me this says a great deal about society, not just the society in which this was written, but society in general: how many of us feel truly alive?Original Review- 2016Let's have a party Victor. Let's get together and celebrate all things Gothic, and dark, and wonderful. Let's have it in an attic in an old house in the middle of a thunderstorm, and then afterwards let's go to the graveyard with our shovels and our body bags. Sounds good doesn't it Victor? We could then create our own doppelgängers from the corpses of criminals and geniuses. Then we can abandon our marvellous creation to fend for itself with his childlike innocence, and then wonder why it goes so horribly wrong and blows up in our faces.Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. On second thought we probably shouldn't have that party.Because if we did it would end in bloodYes, lots of blood: the blood of everyone you love, the blood of all your family Victor. You blame the monster, but you are his creator. You should have taught him the ways of the world and guided his first steps. The things you two could have accomplished together. So I ask you this Victor, who is the real monster? Is it the creature that has gone on a murderous rampage or it you? You are the man who played at god and was horrified at the consequence. You judged your creation by his physical appearance, which was more a reflection of your vain soul. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. Surely you don't wonder why the monster revenged himself upon you?\"I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...\"Indeed, the real monster of this novel is Victor Frankenstein, and not his monstrous creation. The creature is a monster on the outside but Victor is on the inside, which is a form much worse. By abandoning the creature he has taught him to become what his appearance is. The first human experience he receives is rejection based upon his physicality. His own creator recoils in disgust from him. He cannot be blamed for his actions if all he has been taught is negative emotion, he will only respond in one way. He is innocent and childlike but also a savage brute. These are two things that should never be put together. Woe to Victor Frankenstein's family.\"There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.\"Mary Shelley raises questions of the danger of knowledge, and shows a probable consequence of trying to play god; the novel portrays nineteen century fears for the rising field of science and knowledge and questions how far it could go. Indeed, in this case Victor takes on the role of a God by creating new life. She also shows us what can happen to a man if he so driven by this thirst for knowledge and how it will ultimately lead to a fall. Victor reminds me somewhat of Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) in this regard. Faustus is a man who sold his soul to Lucifer for unlimited knowledge in the form of arcane magic. Victor, like Faustus, has stopped at nothing to gain his goal, but in the end is ultimately dissatisfied with the result.Suffice to say, I simply adore this book as you may have gathered from my ramblings. I think this, alongside Dracula, are amongst the strongest representations of Gothic literature. Furthermore, I have a real soft spot for epistolary means of storytelling. I'm not sure why, perhaps it's the stronger sense of intimacy you fell with the characters as you see their words on the page rather than an impartial narrators. You see inside their heads more and understand their motifs and feelings.My favourite quote:\"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.Listen to the passion, to the intellect and witness such a wasted opportunity. Victor, you're a silly, silly, man.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________"

        "user_review": "Myapologies, but thisreviewis going to be a bitfranticdue to mybrainbeing sooxygen-starvedby the novel'sbreath-stealinggorgeousness that I'm feeling a bit light-headed. So please forgive the random thoughts.First:Mary Shelley…I love you!!Second:Dear Hollywood - you lyingdung pileof literature-savaging, no talent hacks…you got this all wrong. Please learn to read and get yourself a copy of the source material before youFUBARit again.Third:My heart shattered for the \"monster\" and I haven't felt this strong a desire to \"hug it out, bitch\" since readingGrendelandCrooked Letter, Crooked Letter. The \"wretch\" is so well drawn and powerfully portrayed that he form the emotional ligament for the entire story. He is among the finest creations the written form has to offer.Fourth:As surprised as I am to be saying this, this novel has oustedDraculaas my all time favorite of the classic horror stories…sorry Bram, but the good/evil, sad, desperate loneliness of the orphaned monster trying to find a purpose and to define himself in the world trumps The Count.Five:No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.As gorgeous as the prose is, I thought it a crime not to include at least one quote.Six:The \"non-explanation\" for the process that Victor uses to create the monster is thing of genius. No other approach could have possibly conveyed the majesty and significance of the achievement, because we would have known it was bullshit. Shelley did it perfectly…which leads me nicely into…Seven:The corny, slapdash lightning scene is entirely a work of Hollywood? There's …NO…lightning…scene? Are you kidding me? Even Kenneth Branagh's supposedly \"true\" adaptation had electric eels providing power to the \"it's alive\" process. All of it bunk. I'll say it again, Hollywood is a bunch of useless tools. . LIARS!!!Eight:Speaking of tools, Victor Frankenstein is a giant one. As far as I am concerned, he is clearly the villain of the piece. However, what I found so squee-inducingly magical about Shelly's writing was my degree of vacillation when it came to Victor's character. I liked and even admired Victor in the beginning of the story and found his personal journey compelling. He was a genius driven by his desire to unlock the secrets of the universe and had that manic, \"mad scientist\" focus necessary to the accomplishment of such a lofty goal. However, once the \"birth\" of the monster came, I found myself waffling back and forth throughout the rest of the story. Ironically, his moment of success and his reaction to life he had conjured was when he began to lose his humanity in my eyes.His treatment of the monster was abhorrent. Despite this, Shelley was able to get me to see over my disgust and appreciate Frankenstein's position and understand why he was so unwilling to continence the existence of \"the wretch.\" Not enough for me to forgive his lack of compassion, but enough for me to see him as a tragic figure. Huge propers for Shelley as that is excellent writing.Nine:I would place the monster among the finest literary creations of all time. This singular manifestation of humanity's scientific brilliance and callous indifference to the consequences thereof is masterfully done. Frankenstein's \"wretch\" became the prototype of the literary outcast and every \"misunderstood\" creature since has been offspring from his loins. His character profile is phenomenal, and just as Victor's actions garner sporadic moments of understanding for his cruel treatment of the monster, so the monster's wanton acts of vile cruelty severely test our compassion for him. Tested, bent and stretched, but, for me at least, never broken. I understood his pain…I understood his anger…I understood.Ten:No spoilers here, but the final resolution of the relationship between Victor and the child of his genius was…stellar. Everything was reconciled and nothing was resolved. The final reckoning occurs and it is both momentous and useless.Eleven:I expected the prose to be good but, having never read Shelley before, I was still surprised by how exceptional and ear-pleasing it was. Her writing really resonated with me and I loved her ability to weave emotion, plot momentum and a high literary quotient seamlessly together. Good, good stuff.Twelve:The novel is structured as anepistolary nesting dollusing the frame story ofCaptain Waltoncorresponding with his sister about his expedition to the North Pole. While at the top of the world, Walton finds Victor Frankenstein stranded. This sets up the dovetail into Walton relaying Victor's story which takes up the bulk of the novel and includes within it the incredibly poignant story of the \"monster\" in the creature's own words. It is superbly executed and I thought the framing device was very effective.Thirteen:Despite my trashing of the movie versions earlier, there was one scene that I thought was handled far better on screen than in this story. Kenneth Branagh's portrayal ofthe murder of Elizabeth by the monsterwas far more chilling than Shelley's more subdued recounting. I actually anticipated this segment being far more shocking and I was a tad let down as a result. This is probably my only gripe about the book.Fourteen:On my list of all time favorite novels. The writing, the story, the characters, the emotion, the imagery, the power…all off the charts.6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!P.S.(orFifteen:) I listened to the audio version of this read by Simon Vance and his performance was extraordinary, especially his portrayal of the \"monster.\" Definitely check it out if you are a consumer of audio books."

        "user_review": "So.I finished it.Warning:If you are a fan of classic literatureand/orare utterly devoid of a sense of humor this review may not be for you.Also:Yes, I realize that I'm a moron with zero literary credibility. So, stop reading right now if the sound of an idiot whistling out of their asshole bothers you too terribly. Sure, you can comment below and tell me how stupid I am, but it probably won't make me a better person. Or will it...?I've always wondered what therealFrankenstein story was like...and now I know.Sadly, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality.And therealityis, this book is a big steaming pile of poo.It's an old-timey horror story, right?Not so much.I mean, I wasn't expecting it to actually be scary, but I thought it might be slightly creepy. Unfortunately, the onlyhorrorin the story centered around me having to keep turning the pages.Unless...Beware mortal! You will DIE of boredom! Oooga-Booga-Booga!Yep. Truly frightening.It starts like this:An upper-crust guy sails off to the Arctic tomake discoveries, and to pass the time he writes to his sister. Supposedly, he's been sailing around on whaling ships for several years. And he's been proven an invaluable resource by other captains.So I'm assuming he's a pretty crusty ol' sailor at this point.Pay attention, because this is where Shelly proves that she knowsnothingabout men...So this guy goes on and on in these letters to his sister about how he wishes on every star that he could find a BFF at sea. After a few (too many) letters, they pull a half-frozen Frankensicle out of the water.Aaaaand here's what our salty sea dog has to say about the waterlogged mad scientist...\"Blah, blah, blah...his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness...blah, blah, blah...\"Lustrous eyes?! No (straight) sailor ever, in the history of the world, EVER referred to another dude's eyes aslustrous.Ever.And I know what you're thinking.Well, Anne, maybe this character was gay. Didn't think about that, didja?!Actually, yes. Yes, I did.The only problem with that theory is thatNONEof the male characters in this book sounded remotelymale.Ladies, do you remember that time in your life (probably around middle or high school), when you thought that guysactuallyhad the same sort of thought waves running through their heads that we do? You know, before you realized that the reallydon'tcare about...well, all of the things that we do? You thought that while they were laughing at the booger their idiot friend just flicked across the room, somethingdeeperwas stirring in their mind. It just had to be!I'm not sure when it happens, but at some point, every woman finally realizes the (fairly obvious) truth.Men aren't women.That booger was the funniest thing ever, andnothingwas stirring around in them other than maybe some gas.And that's ok.Fart-lighting and long distance loogie hawking contests aside, they can pretty darn cool.But this author was too young to realize that.My personal opinion is that Mary was probably fairly sheltered when it came to real men. She was a teenage girl apparently running around with a bunch of artsy-fartsy dudes. Much like today, I would imagine these junior emos were probably blowing poetic smoke up her young ass in the high hopes of getting into her pants.Although it's possible I'm totally misreading the situation.Anyway, Frank tells his story, and Sea Dog writes it all down for his sister.In excruciating detail.Rivers, flowers, rocks, mountain tops...agonizingly cataloged. And the weather? God forbid a breeze blows through the story withoutat leasta paragraph devoted to the way it felt on his skin or affected his mood!And speaking of Frankenstein'smood.I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of reading about a character this spineless before. What a pussy! He didn'ttalkso much as hewhined.And the swooning!He was like one of those freaking Fainting Goats!I can't even count how many times he blacked out and fell over. Of course, then he would get feverish and need \"a period of convalescence\" to recover.Again, every episode was recounted with incredible attention to detail.I'm thrilled that I never had to miss a moment of his sweaty brow getting daubed with water!Randomly Inserted Fun Fact:Themonsterquoted Milton in Paradise Lost.Shockingly, I only know this because it was in the appendix, and not because I have any real-life experience with reading that one.Was this the most painfully unnecessary book I've read this year?Yes.Is there a deeper moral to this story?Yes.Some would say, that the monster is a product of a society that refuses to accept someone who is different. Or maybe that Victor Frankenstein was the real monster for not realizing that he had a duty toparentand care for his creation? Perhaps it is meant to point out our obsession with perfection, and our willingness to disregard people who don't meet the standards of beauty as non-human?Some might say any of those things.I,however, learned a far different lesson from Frankenstein.And it's this...Trust no one.Not even someone who (just an example) has been yourBest Friendfordecades!Let's read a classic, Anne. It'll be fun, Anne. We can call each other with updates, Anne. It'll be just like a book club, Anne. Tee-hee!Liar, liar! Pants on fire!I read this whole God-awful book, and you quit after 10 pages!I'm telling your mom!Anyway.Here's the quote that sums up my experience withFrankenstein:\"Blah, blah, blah...in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\""

If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.\"-From the 1994 movieThe worst thing about this novel is how distorted it has become by constant movie adaptations and misinformed ideas about the nature of Frankenstein and his \"monster\". For years, like many others, I thought Frankenstein was the name of that slightly green dude with the bolts in his neck. Nuh-uh.DidFrankensteinscare me? Did it have me staying awake and sleeping with the light on, jumping at every slight creak in the house? Was I terrified of the monster and technology and the dangers of playing God?No.Because the beauty of this story is that it isn't the one so many people think it is. Which is almost my favourite thing about it. This book is not a Halloween kind of story with Halloween kind of monsters.This story is heartbreakingly sad.\"...once I falsely hoped to meet the beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.\"The book offers many interesting avenues of philosophical exploration if one wishes to ponder such things. For example, allusions to religion and Genesis, possible criticisms of using science to \"play God\", and the relationship between creator and creation. All of these things interest me, yes, but it is the painfully human part of this book that has always so deeply affected me.Because the sad thing, the really sad thing, is that pretty much everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... but so many don't know howhumanthe character is. Created as a scientific experiment by an overly ambitious man, he comes into a frightening and hostile world that immediately rejects him on sight. Even the man who made him cannot look upon his creation without feeling horror. It's that same thing that gets me in books every time:things could have been so different. If people had just been a little less judgmental, a little less scared, and a little more understanding.This being, created from different parts of corpses, seeks love and finds hatred, so he instead decides to embrace it. Fuelled by his own rage at the unfairness of the world, he gradually turns towards evil.He belongs in my own little mental category with the likes of Heathcliff and Erik (aka The Phantom of the Opera). Scared, angry villains who were made so by their own unfortunate circumstances.The kind of characters you simultaneously hate and love, but most of all hope they find some kind of peace.So call it science-fiction, if you want. Call it horror, if you must. But this story is brimming with some of the most realistic and almost unbearably moving human emotion that I have ever read.Blog|Leafmarks|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr"

Seems I'm never too old to be wrong. This time, I don't have the excuse that I was forced to read this for high school lit. class. Oh no, this time I read this of my own volition and for fun. Yeah, fun. Kinda like sticking bamboo shoots between my fingernails type of fun. Watching paint dry fun. Going to an Air Supply concert fun.OK, to be fair, I need to tell you what I liked about this....Well, Mary Shelley was a teen when she wrote this. Color me impressed. At 19 I was just looking for my next college boyfriend, not penning the great English classic. Kudos to Mary for that.Otherwise, I can't think of anything to admire in this book, apart from the fact that it's the only book in my reading history where I actually noted EVERY SINGLE PAGE NUMBER and mentally counted down the time I'd be finished.Why did I persist, you may ask? Well, at the point where the pain became mind numbing, I decided to channel my inner John McCain and just survive the torture. Figured it would make me a better, stronger reader. Might even make me enjoy a re-read ofBreaking Dawn....(well, no it wouldn't, but you get the idea).Frankensteinis a classic alright. A classic melodrama. Complete with a wimpy, vaporish, trembling prima donna main character and a pseudo monster whose only sin is being uglier then Bernie Madoff in cell block D. After the upteenth tremble/jerk/gasp/faint/start from our mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, I could only sign in relief that he wasn't a Rabbi about to perform a bris circumcism - oy vey!Were we supposed to be outraged at the monster's killing spree? By the books end, I was merely miffed that the creature murdered the wrong Frankenstein sibling. He would have saved himself a good deal of traveling (and saved me a good deal of suffering) had he snuffed out hismakerbefore he could high-tail it out of the birthing room.I'm sure that the fans of this book will say that I didn't understand the deeper, symbolic nuances of this book, and I'm sure that they are right. At this point in my life, all I know is what I like and don't like in a book, and as far as I'm concerned, this book is unadulterated, mind-numbing crap. But that's just me. Your mileage will vary (as I sincerely hope it does). As for my own mileage, it can best be compared to driving a Ford Pinto in the Indy 500...EDITDue to the efforts of a few Kool-ade drinking trolls who have gotten their big girl/big boy panties in a wad over an almost 200 year old book and can't comment nicely on my review, I am suspending all future comments.Don't like it? Blame the navel grazing trolls for not accepting the concept of aPERSONAL OPINION."

It's in the same vein as thinking of that urban legend about the people who watched the first movie screaming when the train races toward them. \"AAAAAH! I AM IN A THEATER, BUT I'M ABOUT TO GET HIT BY A TRAIN!!! HERE IT COMES! TELL MY WIFE I LOVE HER!\"I highly recommend reading it through that lens. Just thinking about that original audience who thought this was a horror. \"Oh, my stars! A creature of most unholy origin! I daren't think of it!\" Idiots.Again, I digress.This is so beautifully written. It really forces you to slow down and take the story in, just so you don't miss a gorgeous line - which in turn makes you appreciate how many great and beautifully executed themes there are at play.Count me impressed.But again, I'm mostly just thinkin' bout how #relatable Frankenstein is.And also the fact that I can Finally I can be one of those assholes who's like \"Frankenstein is the SCIENTIST, not the monster!!!!\"I'm living the dream.Bottom line: This is nonstop fun and everyone should have (read: read) it.-------------currently-reading updatescan already relate to victor frankenstein as i, too, create massive problems and then avoid dealing with them until the repercussions threaten to destroy my life and even then am kinda like \"ok but do i have to\""

        "user_review": "Mary Wollstonecraft, a teenager, was spending a vacation in Switzerland with her fiancé,Percy Shelley, their mutual friend,Lord Byron, and a few other people. Was the weather gloomy that summer of 1816? Were the companions bored to death? One evening, they challenged each other into writing the scariest ghost story they could come up with. No one remembers what the fellows wrote on that occasion. Except for the young woman's literary creature and the misfortunes of Victor Frankenstein.Since then, what was meant as an entertaining story, rose to the dimension of a myth. So much so that the original novel itself has been covered up by layer upon layer of external imagery, which has very little to do with it — in particular, the heavily made-up face of Boris Karloff in the 1931 unfaithful film adaptation of this book. Nowadays, there are all sorts of adaptations (e.g. Kenneth Branagh's movie, with De Niro, more on that below), parodies (Mel Brook'sYoung Frankenstein), and probably even spooky porn versions.However, Mary Shelley's novel is not so much about ghosts or monsters, as it is a meditation on the Biblical theme of Creation and Fall. Naturally, the idea of creating a living being — using some human technique instead of natural reproduction —, comes from the 16th-century Jewish narrative of theGolemof Prague. The subtle hints and overt references to Milton'sParadise Lostare also quite noticeable — the \"daemon\", rejected from the start as an ugly duckling, learns to read with a copy of this book (?). At any rate,Frankensteinis a brilliant and existential reverie on the theme of God and Satan (Frankenstein and the \"daemon\") and Adam and Eve (Frankenstein and Elizabeth / the monster and the potential lady-monster).Another striking aspect ofFrankenstein's narrative is the Russian-dolls-like structure of the tales: first Captain Walton's letters, which frame the whole novel, then Victor Frankenstein's account and, finally, a tale within the tale, thedaemon's story. This particular form is in keeping with earlier gothic novels and harks back to theOne Thousand and One Nights, to which Mary Shelley might have had access, through Antoine Galland's translation into French. Incidentally, Safie's story, around the middle of the novel (another embedded tale within a tale), has some oriental undertones.Mary Shelley's book is considered one of the earliest examples of the Science Fiction genre. However, there is not much science or technology to speak of inFrankenstein, apart from a few mentions ofParacelsusand a couple of other alchemists and astrologers. The minor references to electricity, magnetism and galvanism are in the spirit of the times. Still,Michael Faraday, who would soon bring significant breakthroughs in these fields, was about the same age as the precocious author ofFrankenstein. Still, the presence of electromagnetism is not only a reference to the myth of Prometheus and the stolen fire. If anything, it expresses a fascination with landscapes: now sunny, beautiful and pleasant; now stormy, sublime and menacing, with ghastly thunderbolts ripping the clouds apart. Mary Shelley had a couple of predecessors —Coleridgeis quoted a few times in her novel —, but that sort of imagery was, by and large, a novelty at the time. It might be interesting to note that while Mary Shelley was writingFrankenstein, Caspar David Friedrich was painting his famousWanderer above the Sea of Fog(see below). This obsession with ominous landscapes would soon become a trope within the romantic and gothic literary tradition (cf. the often ridiculedBulwer-Lytton's \"dark and stormy night\").Frankensteinis also considered an early example of the modern Horror genre. However, the general impression is not exactly a feeling of terror. Rather a romantic and quite often bombastic expression of strong emotions: despair, anguish, despondency, melancholy, misery, wretchedness, affliction, etc., are words that come repeatedly under Mary Shelley's pen. This accumulation of epithets might feel quaint and a little schmaltzy to a modern reader.Even so,Frankensteinhas probably been a significant inspiration to crime mystery novels, such as Stevenson'sDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hydeand later avatars of serial killers on a murderous rampage. It has probably also exerted a strong influence on scary adventure stories, such as Poe'sNarrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, Wells'Island of Doctor Moreau, or Lovecraft'sAt the Mountains of Madness. It might, nowadays, become once more a significant source of inspiration, as contemporary technology explores new forms of sentient and intelligent beings, out of GMO, silicon or some weird combination of the two.Mary Shelley's Frankenstein(1994), directed by Kenneth Branagh, followed Francis Ford Coppola's box-office hitBram Stocker's Dracula(1992). The cast is imposing: De Niro, Branagh, Hulce, Bonham Carter, Holm, Cleese. The screenplay (written by Frank Darabont, who would later developThe Walking DeadTV series) is, for the most part, faithful to Mary Shelley's novel. However, while Coppola'sDraculawas darkly luxurious and decadent, the style of Branagh'sFrankensteinis loud and vehement, at times stomach-churning or downright silly.The biopicMary Shelley(2017) by Haifaa al-Mansour, with Elle Fanning, is primarily a romance, recounting the complicated situation in which the young woman met her husband and how she got to write her masterpiece. The portrayals of Percy Shelley and Lord Byron are rather unflattering."

        "user_review": "It's been fifty years since I had readFrankenstein, and, now—after a recent second reading—I am pleased to know that the pleasures of that first reading have been revived. Once again--just as it was in my teens--I was thrilled by the first glimpse of the immense figure of the monster, driving his sled across the arctic ice, and marveled at the artful use of narrative frames within frame, each subsequent frame leading us closer to the heart of the novel, until we hear the alienated yet articulate voice of the creature himself. In addition, I admired the equally artful way the novel moves backward through the same frames until we again reach the arctic landscape which is the scene of the novel's beginning...and its end.This time through, I was particularly struck with how Mary must have been influenced by the novels of her father. The relentless hounding of one man by another who feels his life has been poisoned by that man's irresponsible curiosity is a theme taken straight out of Godwin'sCaleb Williams, and the cautionary account of a monomaniac who gradually deprives himself of the satisfactions of family, friends and love in pursuit of an intellectual ideal is reminiscent of the alchemist ofSt. Leon. Her prose also is like her father's in her ability to make delicate philosophical distinctions and express abstract ideas, but she is a much better writer than he: her sentences are more elegant and disciplined, and her descriptive details more aptly chosen and her scenes more effectively realized.The conclusion of the novel seems hasty and incomplete, but perhaps that is because the concept ofFrankensteinis so revolutionary that no conclusion could have seemed satisfactory. At any rate, this fine novel has given birth to a host of descendants, and—unlike Victor Frankenstein—is a worthy parent of its many diverse creations."

        "user_review": "''Man,' I cried, 'how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!''For over 200 yearsFrankensteinby Mary Shelley has captured our minds and toyed with our fears, entering the canon of classic while remaining as relevant and thought provoking a metaphor as science progresses onward. It is certainly worthy of the lasting fame, being an exquisite blend of gothic horror and Romantic morality that delves into philosophical and allegorical inquiries in an endlessly engaging narrative that had me reading late into the night with a fervor to reach the end. It is a story we likely all know, and not much new to say someone hasn't already said and better, but even still I was fascinated by every detail, with its fabulist monster story, the nested framing of two men on a quest in the arctic, the epistolary narrative, the plots of murderous vengeance and, of course, the fall from innocence with the damnation of ambition. This is also a story about how being a deadbeat dad passes along trauma that reacts negatively and is rather terrifying with its massive monster that moves fast and kills hard. This cautionary creation tale of catastrophe forces us to confront the grotesqueries of humanity grappling with life and death, and question what is truly monstrous.'Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.'This is a book where the story about its creation is just as compelling as the novel itself. Written when Mary Shelley was 19, this would arrive on the scene under high expectations to see what the young writer of notable literary heritage (her father wasWilliam Godwinand her late mother the feminist writer and activistMary Wollstonecraft) would produce. 'My husband,' she writes in an introduction, referring toPercy Bysshe Shelley, 'was from the first very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enroll myself on the page of fame.' The novel sprang into creation supposedly during a dream (not unlike her doctor Frankenstein's prophetic dream of creation) afterLord Byronproposed to his friends they each should write a ghost story while they were allstuck indoors on a retreat togetherat Lake Geneva. This same retreat would also birth the novelThe VampyrebyJohn William Polidori, who based his villain on Byron himself becauseLord Byron was kind of insufferable. And a deadbeat dad, not unlike Victor Frankenstein. The novel itself can be read as a commentary on the experience of writing it, something she teases in her introduction about the creative experience of an artist and to which she writes that 'I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper.' Unlike her doctor, there is a sense of care over her creation. Now, onward!'To examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death.'This book is sort of the antidote to those cliche inspirational office posters about ambition everyone had in the 90s, because here we find ambition to drip into arrogance and basically create calamity. Framed from the perspective of Cpt. Walton as he attempts to reach the North Pole—and fails—we hear the story of another man who's blinded by his own ambition until it is too late. Doctor Victor Frankenstein's story is a chilling fall-from-grace story, beginning with a sweet adolescence that slowly turns to the grotesque along a path of bloodied corpses of innocent people to chronicle his own loss of innocence. The spark to this is the early death of his mother, coupled with his reading of scientific books at university (self-education through books is mirrored as well through his monster), amalgamating into an idea with the best intentions to 'renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.' We all know the maxim that good intentions are the paving stones to Hell, however.'Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed.'While we tend to just remember the Doctor's last name, the full title of the book isFrankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,and here we begin to understand why fire and light is such a frequent symbol. As Prometheus gave fire to humans and was punished for it, we see Frankenstein attempt to 'pour a torrent of light into our dark world' by conquering death and creating life (with electric shock instead of fire but close enough), something that will be his own undoing. It is only natural, drawing on ideas of the Romantics that nature is the pinnacle of good and perfection and since he 'collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame,' to create and give life to his creation, therefore the manufactured (see also: \"unnatural\") creation must also be profane and Frankenstein shall be punished. You know, the whole 'don't play god' argument. The creature wrecks havoc on Frankenstein's life as 'the cold stars shone in mockery,' and the barren Arctic is a sort of Hell (devoid of fire and warmth) where Victor inevitably meets his demise.Yet Victor never views his ambitions as unnatural (him and the Captain being figuratively blinded by their ambitions functioning as another fire/light metaphor), and even at the end he says to Walton 'I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.' He sees no ethical dilemma in his manufacturing of life, his fears stem from the supposed hideousness of his creation—'ugly…a thing such as Dante could not have conceived'—and then later the string of murders. 'A new species would bless me as its creator and source,' Victor writes, propping himself up as a paternal godlike figure, 'no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs,' however he fails as a father to his creation by abandoning it. He does not even give the creation a name, even when hunting it after the multiple murders. This is key, as in fairy tales naming something is a way to take away it's power (think Rumpelstiltskin being defeated by guessing his name). 'I think of the act of naming as diagnosis,'Rebecca Solnitwrites in her essayCall Them by Their True Names, 'once you name a disorder, you may be able to connect to the community afflicted with it, or build one.' Seeing as the creation turns to evil deeds due to a feeling of isolation and being othered, this idea of naming, of giving a space, makes the lack of naming or any parental care more emphasized as a fatal misstep. So not only does Victor have his fall from grace for trying to play god, but also failing in even the most basics of paternal support.'Am i to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?'Let's turn now to Frankenstein's monster. Left to his own devices, this giant manufactured from death finds he is met with fear and misunderstanding at every turn. While he seems to only have pure intentions at first, he is pushed into solitude and begins to lash out, especially at his creator (definitely some religious symbolism there). While he may be manmade, he is also very human all the way down to emotions and existential crises of selfhood:'I was dependent on none and related to none. The path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.'The creature conducts his autodidactic education mostly through reading and watching a family interact. Among his books are Goethe'sThe Sorrows of Young Werther, and Milton'sParadise Lost, the latter being very influential on his impressions of the world and themself. From Milton he reads himself first as Adam in the creation story, but later identifies with Satan instead:'I am thy creature: I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.'Though he also notes that 'yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone' Milton pops up everywhere in his sections, such as the monsters statement that 'evil thenceforth became my good,' which paraphrases Milton's line 'Evil be thou my good.' In anessay on the novel,Joyce Carol Oatesargues that the monster's surprise at his reflection in the water is not a reference to Narcissus as is typically claimed, but instead a reference to Eve from Paradise Lost: 'Of sympathy and love; there I had fixt / Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire.' This, she argues, makes the monster a sort of reverse holy trinity of creation instead of creator, speaking from Milton's Adam, Eve and Satan as opposed to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. There is another interesting reversal that Shelley plays with, somethingWilliam Veeder callsthe 'negative Oedipus.' The monster kills Elizabeth to get to his 'father', Frankenstein, while the death of the doctor's mother is his motivation to play Holy Father. At all times Shelley constructs a duality of parenthood and horror.While the classic human vs nature and the whole ethical conundrum is fascinating, it is the look at the person under the extreme absence of love and support that grabs me most. On one hand it is an intriguing look at the horrors of isolation and being othered, but it also makes me wonder how narratives like this became concrete in collective consciousness and instill further fear into people against anything different. Is this also central to ideas of xenophobia and pushbacks against equality, the fear that if we allow the marginalized to have space they will harm the people-of-status-quo/colonizers as a state of revenge? Thinking about it that way is frustrating and sad, the idea that those who have been harmed continue to be so out of fear for the repercussions, which only furthers the othering and marginalizing. So I guess that's something to consider too and work on undoing in social consciousness. And a reminder to give love and empathy. The creation only wanted to be understood, given empathy and space, given love.'I could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other.'Now the question here proposed by Shelley is, who is the 'true' monster? The man who reached for the profane and abandoned it into a life of torment turning toward evil, or the misunderstood being thrust into the world already considered an abomination and becoming 'malicious because I am miserable.' Its ethical quandaries like this that make this a fantastic classroom choice or one to toss and turn with for days. The National Theater had an excellentstage adaptationwhere the two leads, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, alternated roles as Frankenstein and Frankenstein's monster to further interrogate this question. Though perhaps the creation says it best: 'Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!'In aninterview with LitHub, authorJeanette Wintersonsays ofFrankensteinthat 'we are the first generations to read it not as gothic horror but as contemporary reality.' Where Shelley's doctor steals body parts to create life with electricity, in our modern day we are pushing closer towards digital AI and already have manufactured body parts to replace our own. Even just this week it has been in the news that scientistshave revived cells in dead pig's brains and other organs, something that could be a breakthrough in increasing viable organ transplants. Perhaps there is something to learn from Victor's failures as we consider how to usher new systems into the world, such asissues of bias in algorithms, or if an AI were to learn from us, what are we reflecting back to ourselves. Perhaps this is why Mary Shelley's classic has endured all this time; with each new advancement in science many fear a Frankenstein unleashing his monster and with each ambition of our own we fear what may happen if we are blinded by our desires. Mary Shelley captures this perfectly and I was surprised how engaging this book was and how relevant it still felt all these years later.4.5/5'Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.'"

That´s theUnderlying ethical, philosophical partBesides faith, there is an open question about identity, soul, consciousness, and especially death. Something so deeply build into our fragile flesh systems that it freaks us out each time we are confronted with it. Thinking about the implications is what Frankenstein is about, mixed withBorderline science and the question of who is really evilMad scientists are certainly as old as time, although I can´t choose if a crazy priest vivisecting human sacrifices is cooler than a Star Wars/Trek antagonist letting robots and AI do all the dirty work.

A reason for that might be that it´s much easier to create a stereotypical work without much depth than to show the complex inner lives of all protagonists and antagonists.Integrating this element opens up many ethical implications regarding who the real monster is, leading toToo many open questions that can´t be answered easilySo instead of being an action filled or thrilling horror fantasy novel, Frankenstein is much deeper than one would expect. Because, honestly, didn´t many people reading it expect something like a typical horror novel and were surprised by the density of wtf moments letting one stop reading to question humanities and life itself?Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "REREAD UPDATE - September 2018:One of my bookclubs (Click to check out Reading List Completists) is reading this for September 2018. I figure it was a good time for a reread since it was one of my favorites and it has been over 20 years since I read it.I did enjoy it again this time and it stands up to the 5 star review and designation of classic. There were a few slow parts - mainly when Dr. Frankenstein would stop the narrative to wax poetical about something - but, not enough t take a way from my overall enjoyment.I still recommend this for everyone and be sure to check out my full original review below.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is definitely one of my favorite books I was required to read in High School. Also, it is my favorite of the classic horror novels. It is perfectly written, suspenseful, and is a bit more thought provoking than scary. One of the best ways I can compare it to other classic horror novels is to Dracula - which I read recently. Dracula has so much repetitive filler that you do not find in Frankenstein, which is the main reason I find Frankenstein to be a more enjoyable book.Also, I would say that this is more a novel of the human condition than an actual horror novel. Some terrifying things happen, but it is the monster within all of us that may end up being more terrifying!Funny side story: when I read this in High School, it was around the same time that the Kenneth Branaugh adaptation came out at the theaters. We were all encouraged to go see it and found it pretty close to the source material. What was amusing was that Time Magazine had a review of the movie bashing it as untrue to the source material and how disappointed Shelley would be that the Boris Karlovian depiction of a lurching, flattop monster with bolts in its neck was ignored for a more serious drama movie. WHAT!? Time Magazine, for goodness sakes, published an article that claims to know the content of the book but is completely wrong and does it while bashing a movie that did a pretty good job with it!? I mean, it it is okay if you prefer the old time movie version of Frankenstein - and it is a classic - but to make definitive statements that are completely wrong in what is supposed to be a well thought of publication (not your typical tabloid supermarket checkout fodder), that is just too much!We need a copy editor over here!"

        "user_review": "LA MELODIA DEL DOLOREEcco il primo Frankenstein della storia del cinema: 1910, è un cortometraggio muto, americano, regia di James, Searley Dawley.Sono passati duecento anni, due secoli tra questo 2018 e quella notte del 1818.Sono la tua creatura, ricordalo: avrei dovuto essere il tuo Adamo, e sono invece l'angelo caduto che tu hai allontanato dalla gioia senza colpa alcuna da parte sua.Dieci anni dopo, 1920, sempre epoca di cinema muto, il primo Frankenstein italiano: la regia è di Eugenio Testa, Umberto Guarracino interpreta il Mostro (questo è l'unico fotogramma sopravvissuto del film).Non si può dire che Mary Shelley sia nata sotto i migliori auspici.Figlia deidue più grandi uomini del loro tempo(definizione che credo sia di Mario Praz), la madre Mary Wollstonecraft, probabilmente la prima femminista della storia, e il padre William Godwin, intellettuale e filosofo radicale, la futura signora Shelley nacque il 30 agosto al posto del figlio maschio che era atteso e per il quale era già pronto il nome di William junior.Il 30 agosto venne alla luce Mary, la madre si ammalò, dieci giorni di febbre, e, il 10 settembre morì.Segno indelebile sulla piccola Mary che probabilmente da questo momento acquistò la predisposizione al dolore e la sensibilità esasperata. Unastoria più romantica d'ogni possibile romanzo, come Mary stessa definì la sua vita.Sembra che ogni giorno si recasse sulla tomba della madre: a piangere, ma a sedici anni anche a promettere amore eterno al suo principe, o meglio, al suo poeta azzurro, Percy Bysshe Shelley.Il Frankenstein che ha cambiato la storia: 1931, regia di James Whale, così appare Boris Karloff nei panni della creatura dopo quattro ore quotidiane di trucco. Da qui in avanti l'aspetto fisico del mostro si rifarà a questo modello.Per continuare sul terreno fecondo alla sua narrativa impregnata disorrowful mood, Mary a 19 anni ha già perso la prima figlia, dopo solo un mese dalla nascita; partorisce un maschio, che muore a tre anni; ha un'altra femmina, che muore a un anno.Più o meno nello stesso periodo, la sorella maggiore Fanny, figlia di padre diverso, si suicida con il laudano. Nel giro di poco si suicida anche la prima moglie di Shelley, preparando così la strada al matrimonio tra la scrittrice e il poeta.Mary riuscì a seppellire anche il suo amato Percy, che morì annegato.Il romanzo di Polidori fu scritto contemporaneamente a quello della Shelley.È proprio in questo arco di tempo, segnato da morte e suicidio (tutte morti premature, se esiste un tipo di morte che non lo sia), che Mary Shelley partorisce il suo romanzo più famoso,Frankenstein, or, the modern Prometheus, tra il 1816 e il 1817, tra i diciannove e i venti anni (fu pubblicato nel 1818).La genesi è aneddoto piuttosto noto: Mary è convinta da sua sorella Claire (Clairmont: stessa madre ma padre differente), che all'epoca era l'amate di Lord Byron, a seguirla a Ginevra dove affittano Villa Diodati. La comitiva è composta da Mary e Shelley, Claire e Byron, il medico e scrittore John Polidori. Tempo piovoso, fu l'anno definito \"senza estate\", gli amici leggono molto, soprattutto storie tedesche di fantasmi e ilParadiso Perdutodi John Milton. Alla fine (solo tre giorni), Mary produce il Frankenstein, Byron frammenti di un romanzo, e PolidoriIl Vampiro, il primo vampiro moderno.La versione cinematografica che trovo più prossima al romanzo della Shelley è questa, del 1994: regia di Kenneth Branagh, Robert De Niro interpreta la mostruosa creatura.Si direbbe che Mary tolga la vita a chi la genera (la morte di parto di sua madre) e generi chi in vita non sa restare (i tre figli): nascere è direttamente collegato al morire, che col Frankenstein diventa assassinio.E Mary si sente contemporaneamente sia il creatore Frankenstein che la mostruosa creatura: Victor Frankenstein, lo scienziato e costruttore impegnato a riprodurre la vita (dalla morte, servendosi di parti di persone già morte) rifiuta la creatura che ha messo al mondo, e la creatura rifiutata si trasforma in agente di distruzione e morte, con metodo, ostinazione, e si direbbe quasi passione, si impegna a distruggere la famiglia del suo autore.Nel senso che, se la famiglia non lo vuole, il neonato (di dimensioni e proporzioni mostruose) eliminerà la famiglia.Kenneth Branagh, regista e interprete, nei panni (pantaloni) del dottor Victor Frankenstein.Viene da rintracciare una genesi del pensiero materno in materia di femminilità nel rifiuto della creatura al momento del concepimento: invece di provare affetto in qualche modo 'paterno', Frankenstein classifica la sua creazione come mostruosa sulla base del solo aspetto fisico e la respinge immediatamente (rifiuta, rinnega…).Eppure il 'neonato' non può essere malvagio fin dal primo momento, non può essere nato cattivo.Ed ecco qui a confronto la creatura e il suo creatore, Frankenstein/Branagh e Mostro/De Niro.Victor Frankenstein, medico e scienziato, è il moderno Prometeo: che ruba il fuoco della vita, ruba la vita alla stessa morte: la materia morta si trasforma in energia viva. Orrenda metamorfosi!Ma se è Frankenstein a sfidare dio, è sulla creatura che si scatena la punizione divina!È la stessa Shelley a essere, per così dire, schizofrenica con i suoi due personaggi: per quanto il lettore dovrebbe tifare in automatico per la creatura che è innocente, è una tabula rasa, dato che è appena nata, e certo non responsabile della sua nascita (come non lo è nessun figlio), la Shelley ci spinge (forse perfino di più) a prendere le parti del dottor Frankenstein, ci vuol convincere che la creatura è un mostro prima di tutto per il suo aspetto fisico (brutta, antiestetica).Jekyll e Hyde con settanta anni d'anticipo.Non poteva mancare il capolavoro, \"young Frankenstein\" di Mel Brooks (1974). Qui, Aigor \"appena morto\".Ma è un mostro umano, probabilmente il primo, e sin dalla sua prima apparizione il terrore si mescola alla compassione, perché la Creatura, che ruba il nome al suo creatore diventando Frankenstein tout court, è da subito un infelice, una vittima, un diverso, qualcuno con cui possiamo identificarci.Talmente umano da diventare sovrumano: la sua dimensione sessuale è elemento di curiosità e attrazione, almeno sullo schermo. Si pensi a Udo Kier che si accoppia con Dalila Di Lazzaro inIl mostro è in tavola, barone Frankensteinprodotto da Andy Warhol, oppure ad Aldo Maccione macho trash inFrankenstein all'italiana, al Frank-N-Furter in guêpière e paillettes inThe Rocky Horror Picture Show, o al tenerissimo mostro creatura di Mel Brooks dotato di grosso schwanzstuck.Creatore e creatura, padre e figlio, Gene Wilder e Peter Boyle.Tutti gli uomini odiano gli sciagurati. Quanto allora devo essere odiato io, di gran lunga il più miserabile tra gli esseri viventi. Pure tu, mio creatore, detesti e disprezzi me, tua creatura, a cui sei legato da vincoli che solo l'annientamento di uno di noi può sciogliere.PSI film dove compare Frankenstein, o meglio, la sua creatura, il Mostro, sono decine, io ne ho contati oltre settanta, incluse le parodie (su tutte, Frankenstein Jr), i cross-over (Frankenstein contro l'Uomo Lupo) , le parodie cross-over (Fracchia contro Dracula).Tim Curry indimenticabile Dr Frank-N-Furter in the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\", il primo artefice bisessuale della \"creatura\"."

        "user_review": "Mucho se ha hablado deFrankenstein. Se interpreta como una crítica al desarrollo científico, cuando este sobrepasa el curso natural de las cosas; se interpreta como una crítica a la religión y nuestra relación con Dios; hasta se ha dicho que es una alegoría a los miedos que surgen durante un embarazo. Todas estas lecturas probablemente sean correctas, pero omiten lo más básico. Lo que hace aFrankensteinuna obra atiborrada de humanidad, con interpolaciones que abordan la desventura a través de la complejidad de tres voces que derraman soledad y melancolía.Si intentara tratar aFrankensteindesde lo más superficial, acabaría hablando sobre la profundidad del espíritu humano y los peligros que conlleva un uso desmedido de sus facultades cognitivas o la influencia del sentimiento en sus actos. No se puede discutir este título sin penetrar en lo más reflexivo de nuestra naturaleza.Frankenstein, en su perfil más somero, abarca temas que atraviesan la columna vertebral de lo que nos hace seres en constante conflicto de moralidades y en una interminable búsqueda por pertenecer y ser reconocidos, como asimismo incluye el derecho a ser amados por al menos alguien en la vida.A partir de un análisis ligero,Frankensteintrata la venganza y el abandono. Son las dos cuestiones principales que hacen esta historia una historia con movimiento. La venganza desde el arrebato y la venganza desde el rechazo. También cabe destacar que es admirable la caracterización del Creador y su Criatura, y sus interminables pugnas por quién posee la más dañina amenaza; ya que, si lo vemos de esa forma, y teniendo en cuenta la completa implicación de las circunstancias en la novela, ¿qué es más nocivo, el rechazo injustificado o el asesinato como consecuencia de una iniquidad anterior?La denominada Criatura, Demonio, Engendro o Monstruo es de los personajes más humanos con los que me he topado. Es suntuosa la carga emotiva, el abigarramiento en el interior de un ser que fue engendrado por ciencia mal utilizada. Un vínculo irónico entre un hombre que quería ser dios y un ser que siempre quiso ser hombre. Para mí esta es la crítica más punzante de Mary Shelley. Repudia que nos dejemos llevar por las apariencias en vez de detenernos a pensar en lo que estamos haciendo. La egolatría, la soberbia y el prejuicio son lo más lamentable de nuestra conducta como humanidad, y esas condiciones danzaron alrededor del llamado Monstruo y acabaron destruyendo la bondad más pura, que, prácticamente, ni había llegado a florecer.No voy a omitir la prosa, que acompaña a la perfección la calidad de este libro. No hay mejor pluma que la que te abraza y te lleva consigo en un viaje por el tiempo y el espacio hacia su historia. Mientras leíaFrankenstein, me sentía allí, junto a Víctor y a su Criatura, percibía la realidad que me rodeaba como falsa, como un pobre bosquejo de lo que estaba leyendo, y creía que mi pertenencia radicaba en el siglo XVII. La ambientación de Shelley es tan estupenda que fue capaz de sobrepasar los límites de la narrativa e invadir el mundo real. Excelente trabajo de la autora. Su estilo de escritura es de los puntos más fuertes del texto.Frankensteinse ha transformado en una de mis obras favoritas. Su retrato de la soledad, el aislamiento forzado, la pérdida y la derrota es sublime. Un relato que se construye sobre lo emocional y que tiene sus raíces en lo más hondo del alma humana."

        "user_review": "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, Mary ShelleyFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by English author Mary Shelley (1797–1851) that tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a grotesque, sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment.Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823.Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment.Frankenstein is a frame story written in epistolary form.It documents a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville.Robert Walton is a failed writer who sets out to explore the North Pole in hopes of expanding scientific knowledge.During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure.A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew.Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning.The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه دسامبر سال 1995میلادی؛ تاریخ خوانش دوم: روز نوزدهم نوامیر سال 2011میلادیعنوان: فرانکشتاین؛ مری شلی؛ مترجم: جعفر مدرس صادقی؛ تهران، نشر مرکز، 1374؛ متن کوتاه شده در 224ص؛ شابک 9643051064؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 19ممترجم: محسن سلیمانی؛ تهران؛ قدیانی، چاپ چهارم 1392؛ در 326ص؛ شابک 9789645366184؛عنوان: فرانکنشتاین یا پرومته نوین؛ نویسنده: مری شلی؛ مترجم: کاظم فیروزمند؛ تهران، نشر مرکز، چاپ دوم 1389؛ در 262ص؛ شابک 9789642131037؛فرانکنشتاین، دانشمند جوانی جاه‌ طلب، و جویای نام است، که جانوری زنده، به شکل انسان، و با ابعاد کمی بزرگ‌تر از یک آدم معمولی، و با ریخت و قیافه‌ ای زشت، و مخوف می‌سازد؛ که همه، از جمله سازنده‌ اش، از دست او، و شرارت‌هایش می‌گریزند؛ اما به تدریج خود آن هیولا، به «فرانکنشتاین» نامدار شده، و این نام، اسم عامی شده، برای آفریده های ویرانگری که از اختیار آفرینشگر خویش نیز، خارج میشوند، و حتی آفریننده نیز، توان مهار نیروی ویرانگر آنها را ندارد؛ «مری شلی»، نویسنده‌ ی این اثر، همسر «شلی»، شاعر بزرگ رمانتیک «بریتانیایی» بودند، و رمان‌های دیگری نیز بنوشته اند، اما تنها همین اثر ایشان بود، که شهرت ماندگار و جهانگیر یافت؛رمانها: «فرانکنشتاین (1818میلادی)»؛ «ماتیلدا (1819 میلادی) - رمان کوتاه»؛ «آخرین نفر (1826میلادی) - در یک سه‌ گانه ی داستانی علمی-تخیلی را روایت می‌کند: سده ی بیست و یکم میلادی است، بیماری طاعون نسل بشر را از بین برده و تنها یک نفر باقی مانده‌ است، آخرین نفر»؛ «والپرگا (1823میلادی) - ماجرایی از زندگی در ایتالیای سده های میانی میلادی را نقل می‌کند»؛ «بخت و اقبال پرکین واربِک (1830میلادی)»؛ «لادور (1835میلادی) - همچنین با عنوان (بیوه زیبا) نیز شناخته می‌شود»؛ «فالکنر (1837 میلادی)؛داستانهای کوتاه: «یادبود»؛ «سفرنامه»؛ «تاریخ شش هفته ‌ای»؛ «وقایع بزرگ و فوق‌العاده»؛ «ولگردی در آلمان و ایتالیا در سال‌های 1840میلادی، 1842میلادی و 1843میلادی»؛شرح حال: شرح زندگانی برجسته ‌ترین ادبا و علما، و ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 12/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "\"It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs…\"-\tMary Shelley,FrankensteinFrankensteinis a marvelous example of a book that escaped from its author and took on an entirely new existence beyond the boundaries of the page. There is an elegant symmetry to this. After all, the novel concerns a \"monster\" or \"daemon\" that slips away from its creator, the scientist Victor Frankenstein, to cause havoc in the world.Today, when we think of Frankenstein – or more accurately, about scientist Victor Frankenstein's never-named creature – we are likely imagining something other than the somewhat vaguely-described human-ish thing in Mary Shelley's 1818 horror classic. Unmoored from its literary roots, the Frankenstein's monster we call forth in our minds is probably closer in conception to Boris Karloff's famous version from the 1930s: square-headed and scarred, with metal bolts in the neck. This is a visage that is ubiquitous every October, found in movies, on television, and selling Halloween candy.Part of the fun of readingFrankensteinis to see how far this cobbled-together man has traveled from Shelley's original iteration. Frankly, this was probably theonlyfun I had, asFrankenstein, for all its bursts of creativity, its sudden flashes of discrete violence, is a bit of a wordy drag. It is fully a piece from the Romantic era, from the overwrought emotional excesses of its characters, to the gorgeous, travelogue-like descriptions of the Alps.***According to Shelley – in an 1831 forward to the revised text –Frankensteinhad its genesis in a spontaneous parlor game between famed wordsmiths, of which she took part. Only eighteen at the time, Shelley was vacationing in Lake Geneva with her husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the famous Lord Byron. Byron apparently suggested they each write a ghost story, since the weather was too lousy to do much else. Mary Shelley's contribution, according to this lore, wasFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. The short story she began in a cold and dispiriting Switzerland eventually became a full-length novel that is currently enjoying a two-hundred year afterlife.***As an aside, Shelley's life, and her relationship with the doomed Percy, is worth exploring. There is free love, unfounded suggestions that Percy pennedFrankenstein, and tragedy aplenty.***Frankensteinutilizes an epistolary framing device, both beginning and ending with a series of \"letters\" from an adventurous mariner to his sister. Initially, I was entirely uncertain what these missives had to do with Frankenstein and his monster. As a result, the novel started extremely slow for me, as I found myself reading only a couple pages at a time before losing interest, never really finding the hook. Ultimately – as you can see – I pushed through, but it was only much later, when the letters reappear at the end, that everything clicked into place (and I went back and reread the opening gambit).Once this prelude is out of the way, we begin the main part of the narrative, which is told in the first-person by the emotionally labile Frankenstein. For reasons put down to obsession, young Frankenstein is preoccupied with creating new life. Working alone and in fanatical devotion to his goal, Frankenstein begins assembling histhing:I collected bones from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation: my eye-balls were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.It does not –shouldnot – spoil anything to say that Frankenstein is successful in his endeavors, at least up to a point.***The monster or creature or daemon or whatever you'd like to call it – just don't call it Frankenstein – comes to life and immediately begins to torment Victor. Unlike the shambling, slow-moving, slow-witted monster of modern pop culture, Shelley's creature moves faster than the zombies in28 Days Later, climbs mountains like Sly Stallone inCliffhanger, and is an exceptionally advanced autodidact, not only teaching himself to speak, but to readParadise LostandPlutarch's Lives.Frankenstein and his monster engage in a globetrotting game of cat-and-mouse, which might have been exciting, if not written in the overly formal, cluttered style of the early nineteenth century. Shelley tells this story broadly, seldom taking any time to build a scene, ratchet up suspense, or pay off a plot arc. Instead, through the excitable, often operatically frantic voice of Frankenstein, we are given broad characters (Elizabeth, for instance, seems to be a forerunner of Dickens's saintly – and boring – Esther Summerson), unexciting action, and pointedly telegraphed plot points. It says something that the high point ofFrankensteinis a story-within-a-story (in true Conradian fashion) told by the monster itself.Honestly, I have a predisposition against books written in the archaic-feeling style ofFrankenstein. It is something I always thought I'd grow out of as I aged. Alas, it has been two decades since high school, and my bias against writers who usetheeandthystill abides.That is not to say I recommend skipping this novel, because I don't. I also did not hate it, not by any means. The story works better in summary than in execution, and it requires close attention, but it is a genuine triumph of imagination. It is also far more polished and thematically coherent than Bram Stoker's later attempt at Gothic horror (which has also turned out to be undying).***Certain books have meanings beyond the composition of sentences and the contours of a storyline. Shelley created something inFrankensteinthat has endured for a couple centuries, and will likely live on forever, as long as people read. For that reason – if notonlyfor that reason – this classic example of a thinking person's horror novel is worth checking out."

        "user_review": "I have a favourite Kate Beaton strip framed up in our book room:(Full-size imagehere.)Mary was – what? – eighteen years old when she went on this famous holiday to Lake Geneva with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron and Byron's physician. She was calling herself 'Mrs Shelley', though they had not yet married – Percy was still married to someone else.The surroundings were familiar. The last time Mary and Percy had come to Switzerland had been during their elopement a couple of years earlier, accompanied by her sister, who was also in love with him; Mary had got pregnant, but the baby girl was born prematurely and died in February 1815. Now they were back, trying to put the past behind them and enjoy a holiday with Byron, who at the time was sleeping with Mary's stepsister. Percy's first wife would soon be out of the picture, found drowned in the Serpentine in an 'advanced state of pregnancy' before the year was out. Mary's other sister Fanny also drowned herself that year, 1816, also pining for Percy.So it was in the midst of this complex love-dodecahedron that the holidaymakers, their festive plans foiled by constant rain, held their famous competition to write a ghost story. The result is something very different from its image in popular culture. Instead of the smoke of Victorian London, we have the Swiss Alps and the Orkney Islands; instead of Igor and bolts through the neck, we have meditations on personal autonomy, scientific responsibility and eugenics.Frankensteinis overwritten and the narrative structure is a bit odd – she was still a teenager when she wrote it, let's not forget – but thematically, it's fascinating. I'm surprised by how few reviews I've read touch on what seems to me to be the intensely female experiences that it obliquely comments on. The confusion of bringing a creature into the world only to feel horror and revulsion towards it. The stress of releasing it into a hostile and uncaring world. And perhaps most of all, the deep sympathy shown with someone who feels that their body is not their own, that it is somehow owned and regulated by others. A body that one is taught by society to hate. The monster's feelings are unimportant, because he was created by a man for the man's own gratification.Mary quotes her beloved Percy Bysshe Shelley, unattributively, when Dr Frankenstein first spots his creature up on the Mer de Glace. She uses the final two stanzas from 'Mutability'. For me though it's the beautiful first stanza that better expresses the ferocious intensity of Mary and her circle of friends and lovers, surrounded as they all seemed to be by imminent, premature death:We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soonNight closes round, and they are lost forever…As they all were. But the writing they left behind will last as long as English literature is read, and for all of its problemsFrankensteinis among that select group."

        "user_review": "¡Qué daño ha hecho el cine a este libro!El ansia del hombre de ser Dios llevó a Víctor Frankenstein a crear un ser, un ser con apariencia humana de restos de humanos, tan deforme que resultó ser un monstruo en su exterior, pero no en su interior, humano dotado de sentimientos, sensibilidad, que lo que más ansiaba era no estar solo, una compañera con quien compartir su vida y el amor. Ante la negativa de su creador de crear otro \"monstruo\", el monstruo se vengó.Novela de personajes, que en un momento dado no sé si quién me daba más pena si el creado o el creador, ambos arrepentidos de distintos actos.Fantásticos los personajes secundarios, tanto la familia de Víctor como la familia con la que aprende su criatura o el capitán del barco.La ambientación gótica le dota a la novela de escenas terroríficas, cuando la criatura cobra vida, cuando huye herido tras haber salvado la vida de una niña que se ahogaba...En cierto momento me ha recordado a \"los miserables\" ¿quién es más miserable? ¿quién es así por su propia naturaleza o quién por las circunstancias acaba así?¿Las circunstancias que te rodean sirven de excusa para realizar esos atroces actos?Ambos parecen las dos caras de una misma moneda o al menos eso me parece a mí.No tengo un personaje favorito, son todos, y lo que más me ha gustado es la narración es casi como una novela epistolar, a veces sientes una narración pausada, tranquila, con matices que parecen versos con tintes oscuros y góticosTrata temas como los límites de la ciencia y la ética, la responsabilidad, la soledad, el amor, el egoísmo..., con muchos matices y muchas lecturas.Un libro muy recomendable."

        "user_review": "Sometimes literature stands for little. The Tambora volcano eruption in 1815 completely changed Europe's climate, particularly between 1816 and 1817. It led to almost glacial periods in the Alps. Around this time, friends Shelley and Byron traveled around Switzerland on vacation. The lousy weather obliges them to often remain secluded in their chalet, with, like a favorite pastime, to invent extraordinary stories. During one of these evenings, it would be born, from the imagination of Mary Shelley, the character of Frankenstein and his creature - feeding on romantic, gothic, and fantastic literature, with the scientific spirit in vogue at the time of the early 19th century. It remained to polish the plot with the help of Percy Shelley. He then relayed by cinema and the high physics of Boris Karloff. And this is how a myth is born!What remains today of good literary work? The plot is very moralizing. Like Prometheus, can a man play the Demiurge? The good feelings, the good, and the bad repeated to excess weigh down the story. Too many lengths on existential themes end up harming the action. From my point of view, this romanticism no longer passes for today's reader.Following the protagonists' wanderings, there remains a glimpse of Europe during the pivotal period between the 18th and 19th centuries, harmonious and fascinating descriptions of majestic landscapes, and a plot that retains an individual interest despite everything.To read to immerse yourself in the times."

        "user_review": "\"-¡Fuera de aquí! Rompo mi promesa. Jamás volveré a crear otro ser como tú, con tu misma deformidad y tus maldades.-Quise razonar contigo, pero has demostrado que no quieres. Recuerda que soy yo quien tiene el poder. Te consideras desgraciado, pero piensa que sólo yo puedo hacerte tan desdichado que la luz del día te resultará odiosa. Tú eres mi creador, pero yo soy tu dueño. ¡Obedece! Ten cuidado porque a nada temo, y eso me convierte en poderoso.\"Fue en abril, durante el verano del año 1816 en Villa Diodati, una localidad Ginebra que el más famoso y más romántico de los Románticos, el poeta inglés, Lord Byron, organizó un desafío literario para escribir el cuento más terrorífico que se les ocurriera, junto a su médico personal, John Polidori, el célebre poeta inglés Percy Bysshe Shelley y su amante, Mary Goodwin, quien más tarde se convertiría en su esposa y con nuevo apellido le daría chispa a la vida de la criatura más emblemática, conocida y arquetípica en la historia de la literatura: el monstruo creado por el científico Víctor Frankenstein.Los relatos de Byron, \"El entierro\", y de Percy Shelley \"Los asesinos\", están inacabados y por ende, es imposible saber cuál podría haber sido su final.El mejor relato de todos es del de John Polidori, \"El vampiro\", que es el disparador de lo que en la actualidad conoceríamos a través de Bram Stoker con \"Drácula\", y esto se debe a que \"El vampiro\" anticipa a la inmortal novela de Stoker 56 años antes de su publicación.Pero sería Mary Shelley quien al final terminaría ganando y todo surge a partir de un extraño y profético sueño que tuvo en ese castillo, luego de leer entre todos distintos cuentos de los más afamados escritores alemanes, siendo E.T.A. Hoffmann el referente más importante.A la mañana siguiente, cuando despertó les contó lo que soñó:\"Vi a un pálido estudiante de arte impías, de rodillas junto al ser que había ensamblado. Vi el horrendo fantasma de un hombre que estaba tendido, y luego, por obra de algún ingenio poderoso, manifestaba signos de vida y se agitaba con movimiento torpe y semivital…\"La escena nos lleva directamente al momento en el que Víctor Frankenstein, en esa tormentosa noche demencial, casi de la misma manera que en el cuento \"El sueño\" que la autora escribiera dos años antes, exclama que si criatura está viva:\"Era ya la una de la noche. Una lluvia lúgubre golpeaba los cristales y la vela estaba a punto de apagarse cuando, iluminado por el resplandor de la luz casi consumida, vi que el ojo amarillento y mortecino de la criatura se abría; respiró con dificultad y agitó sus miembros con un movimiento convulso.\"Increíblemente y como si fuera una trágica maniobra del destino, ese encuentro tendría un final funesto: en 1821 John Polidori se suicidaría pero le sobrevivirá su inmortal cuento y Percy Bysshe Shelley moriría ahogado a orillas del lago Leman, dos meses después y de todo ese dolor surgiría esta obra inmortal llamada \"Frankenstein, o el moderno Prometeo\"que Mary Shelley escribiría con tan sólo dieciocho años.\"Pero esto no es todo. Existe un dato que no muchos conocen acerca de Mary Shelley: cuando el cuerpo de Percy Bysshe Shelley es llevado ante ella, pide que le saquen el corazón, dado que cuando Shelley es cremado su corazón, por razones completamente inexplicables, ¡no se quemó!Ante esta señal, ella pidió que lo envolvieran en hojas de sus propios poemas, lo pusieran en un estuche y lo colocaran en su ataúd cuando ella misma falleciera y de esta manera, cuando esto sucedió, la enterraron junto con el corazón de su amado.Más Romanticismo que eso,imposible.Poco queda por agregar acerca de Frankenstein que no se haya escrito ya a estas alturas.La novela es y será una de las más representativas del Romanticismo. Contiene muchos elementos de este movimiento: desde la dualidad Víctor/Monstruo, que en cierta manera es una forma de temática del doble, el sufrimiento del que sabe que va a perder (en ambos casos), el titanismo romántico claramente expuesto en la obra, el juego peligroso con la ciencia (El extraño Caso del Dr. Jekyll y Mr. Hyde de Robert Louis Stevenson es otro caso y posteriormente lo será también \"La isla del doctor Moreau\" de H.G. Wells ) y la referencia de Prometeo (de allí el subtítulo de la misma), ese semi dios condenado al que hace referencia, inmortalizarán esta obra.La obra posee tres narradores bien diferenciados. En primer lugar leemos las cartas del capitán Walton quien nos presenta la historia de cómo encuentra al doctor Víctor Frankenstein en medio del lugar más congelado del Polo Norte.Posteriormente, todos los sucesos que Frankenstein le cuenta a Walton, desde cómo es su niñez hasta la creación del horrendo monstruo y lo que sucede después ante la negativa suya de crearle una compañera y por último es el turno de la criatura quien le cuenta a Frankenstein todas las vicisitudes que tuvo que pasar hasta que encuentra nuevamente a su creador.Cuando uno cree que es terrible lo que lee acerca de lo que sufre Víctor Frankenstein, se queda sin palabras al enterarse de las miserias e injusticias que la criatura debe sobrellevar para no sucumbir.Es extremadamente bella y a la vez terrible la manera en que la autora nos acerca ambas historias, ya que logra conmovernos en ambos casos, a punto tal que no sabemos cómo lectores a quién apoyar.El encuentro entre ambos y lo que surge de ello es épico y no existe otro adjetivo para describir tanta perfección.Los diálogos son poderosos, las escenas subyugantes y el argumento está construido sin fallas para todo se vaya ensamblando con el correr de la lectura.La novela es cerrada magistralmente cuando los tres, Walton, Frankenstein y la criatura se encuentran y le ponen fin a este drama tan intenso, tan único, tan descollante.Es algo verdaderamente espeluznante tratar de entender cómo pudo Mary Shelley, esta adolescente de dieciocho años en el siglo XIX, crear algo tan inolvidable y terrible.Más de un estudioso de las letras se lo sigue preguntando."
