Η απόπειρα αυτή ξεκινάει από το πιο βασικό στοιχείο, τοσημείο, για να περάσει στηγραμμήκαι να καταλήξει στοεπίπεδοκαι στην τελική σύνθεση των επιμέρους στοιχείων. Όλες οι εντάσεις, εσωτερικές και εξωτερικές, τα χρώματα, οι μορφές, τα υλικά, τα σχήματα και ο συνδυασμός τους αναλύονται και παρουσιάζονται με φόντο την ιστορία, τις επιστήμες, τις διάφορες τέχνες, ακόμη και την φιλοσοφία. Προσωπικά, με βοήθησε να κατανοήσω πολλές αρχές τις τέχνης αυτής την οποία γνώριζα μόνο σε ιστορικό επίπεδο, αλλά χωρίς να μου δώσει την εντύπωση ενός ξεκάθαρου εγχειριδίου, μίας επιστήμης της τέχνης. Ακόμη κάποια πράγματα παραμένουν θολά, μετέωρα και ίσως πιο εμπειρικά, σίγουρα όμως ανοίγει δρόμους και προοπτικές για μια διαφορετική προσέγγιση και βίωση του καλλιτεχνικού κόσμου."

        "user_review": "Absolutely awful. One of the worst books I've ever read. Kandinsky's writing is extremely weak, with numerous undefined terms (especially \"tension\", \"sound\" and \"temperature\" as they relate to graphic objects), and an abundance of unsupported claims. For example,The most objective of the three typical angles is the right angle, which also is the coldest. It divides the square plane into exactly 4 parts. The acute angle is the tensest as well as the warmest. It cuts the plane into exactly eight parts.andAt the moment the point is moved from the center of the basic plane - eccentric structure - the double sound becomes audible: 1. absolute sound of the point, 2. sound of the given location in the basic plane. This second sound, which in the case of the centric structure was almost silenced, again becomes distinct and transforms the sound of the point from the absolute to the relative.Hogwash.I'm a mathematician and an art creator, so perhaps this kind of pseudo-mathematical writing disturbs me more than it would others. It's a great disappointment, since I revere much of Kandinsky's art."

        "user_review": "Read alongsideAbstraction in Art and Nature. These two books take diametrically opposite, and supplementary approaches.Point and Line to Planeis primarilya priori andAbstraction in Art and Nature a posteriori.They benefit from being read together.UnlikeAbstraction in Art and Nature, this derives formal relationship through a quasi-axiomatic method, using the most elementary visual primitives. Kandinsky attempts to derive and relate intuitive and emotional responses to these forms. He generally does not use examples from the \"material realm\".This may be off putting to artists who never work with, say, triangles or straight lines, or those whose approach is entirely intuitive.I think its strength lies in the way it looks at correspondences and analogies between colors, diagonals, clusters of points and so on. For example, yellow is a \"hotter\" and \"sharper\" color than blue, and a triangle is a \"sharper\" and \"hotter\" shape than a circle. So in a composition, a triangular shape can be augmented by coloring it yellow, and given a softened, and mixed character by coloring it blue. So you can use awareness of these kinds of correspondences to vary the emotional and compositional characteristics of a visual work."

I contenuti non sono di facile assimilazione, perché sono anche molto personali e comunque rappresentano una concezione di arte e di pittura risalente ormai a circa cento anni fa, e l'arte contemporanea intanto ne ha fatta di strada, è stato scritto tantissimo, le teorie si sono evolute a una velocità incredibile e in direzioni completamente diverse. Ma in ogni caso questo libro ci aiuta a comprendere il flusso che è alla base del pensiero artistico di Kandinsky - un pittore che astrattista non ci è certo nato, ma lo è diventato - e ci dimostra come il suo sentire l'arte non sia frutto di casualità, ma di teorie ben precise e complesse nelle forme e nell'elaborazione. Consigliato agli appassionati di Avanguardie."

        "description": "\"I had the impression that here painting itself comes to the foreground; I wondered if it would not be possible to go further in this direction.\"Thus did the young Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) react to his first viewing of Monet's Haystack , included in an 1895 Moscow exhibit of French Impressionists. It was his first perception of the dematerialization of an object and presaged the later development of his influential theories of non-objective art.During study and travel in Europe, the young artist breathed the heady atmosphere of artistic experimentation. Fauvism, Cubism, Symbolism, and other movements played an important role in the development of his own revolutionary approach to painting. Decrying literal representation, Kandinsky emphasized instead the importance of form, color, rhythm, and the artist's inner need in expressing reality.In Point and Line to Plane , one of the most influential books in 20th-century art, Kandinsky presents a detailed exposition of the inner dynamics of non-objective painting. Relying on his own unique terminology, he develops the idea of point as the \"proto-element\" of painting, the role of point in nature, music, and other art, and the combination of point and line that results in a unique visual language. He then turns to an absorbing discussion of line — the influence of force on line, lyric and dramatic qualities, and the translation of various phenomena into forms of linear expression. With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky's earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art . As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.",

Ormai dal 1991.Però penso che non sia colpa del libro: non appena avrò tempo e mi darò nuovamente alla pittura, allora entrerà ancora nella mia sfera di interessi e troverò il modo di leggerlo.Per adesso lo piazzo in libreria."

        "user_review": "Me parece excelente la premisa: proponer un nuevo comienzo de la teoría del arte. Un nuevo arte, como el abstracto, necesita nuevas terminologías. Aquí Kandinsky se propone desestructurar las ideas y retomarlas desde lo más fundamental: el trazo y la línea. Sin embargo, el autor padece de las mismas características negativas que contaminaron los discursos de sus contemporáneos en la teoría literaria. Un hermetismo académico y una frialdad en la escritura. Ciertamente es un libro importante, porque la idea de proponer una nueva ciencia del arte resulta esencial para entender el abstraccionismo. No obstante, me parece que sus cualidades negativas llegan a pesar en la lectura y, como gran parte del género teórico, en momentos los puntos de vista más interesantes del autor están resueltos en notas al pie de página."

I read it before completing one of my favorite academic architecture projects: A house for Kandinsky. It helped me identify elements of his artwork that I could translate into a home for the artist which I though captured the essence of his painting through an architectural work. It's a relatively short read so it was no sweat to finish it in a couple days."

With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky's earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art . As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.",

        "user_review": "Καντίνσκι, Σημείο, Γραμμή – ΣημείοΑυτό που επεδίωξε ο συγγραφέας με αυτό το έργο του ήταν να θέσει τις βάσεις ώστε η αφηρημένη τέχνη να αποκτήσει τη σπουδαιότητα που της αρμόζει.Ξεκινάει με το σημείο, που κατά τη γνώμη του ανήκει στις συνήθειες που είναι μέσα μας αγκυροβολημένες με την παραδοσιακή τους αντήχηση, που είναι άφωνη. Η αντήχηση της σιωπής, που συντροφεύει συνήθως το σημείο, είναι τόσο δυνατή που ξεκουφαίνει τις άλλες ιδιότητες.Το σημείο αυτό υπάρχει πάντα μέσα μας, όμως τοποθετείται από τον καλλιτέχνη επάνω στον καμβά, στο χαρτί ή οπουδήποτε αλλού όταν υπάρχει λόγος. Μπορεί σε κάποιο έργο ένα σημείο να φαίνεται εντελώς αφηρημένο κι άσκοπο όμως έχει προέλθει ύστερα από ώριμη σκέψη, ίσως βέβαια και ασυνείδητη από τον καλλιτέχνη.Το ανοιχτό μάτι και το προσεκτικό αυτί (του καλλιτέχνη ή παρατηρητή) μετασχηματίζει τις ελάχιστες αισθήσεις σε σημαντικά περιστατικά. Τα νεκρά σημάδια γίνονται ζωντανά και ό,τι ήταν νεκρό ξαναζωντανεύει.Συνεχίζει με τη γραμμή που μας αναφέρει πως γεννήθηκε από την κίνηση – αφού εκμηδένισε την υπέρτατη ακινησία του σημείου.Η έλλειψη ακριβούς ορολογίας είναι δυστύχημα για τη ζωγραφική, διότι κάθε επιστημονική εργασία γίνεται δύσκολη, ίσως και αδύνατη.Σήμερα ο άνθρωπος κυριαρχείται από τον εξωτερικό κόσμο και το εσωτερικό είναι νεκρό γι' αυτόν.Για παράδειγμα, ένα υπέροχο σάλτο μιας χορεύτριας του μπαλέτου μπορεί να αποτυπωθεί στον καμβά από έναν ζωγράφο με πέντε έξι γραμμές και μερικές ίσως τελείες.Ενώ από τη μια ο Καντίνσκι βάζει τις βάσεις για την εξήγηση της αφηρημένης τέχνης, από την άλλη μας αναφέρει πως δεν είναι σκοπός του να εγκαταστήσει κανόνες λίγο ή πολύ ακριβείς. Είναι σημαντικό να προκληθούν συζητήσεις αναφορικά με τις θεωρητικές μεθόδους. Μια άλλη σκέψη είναι πως οι μέθοδοι ανάλυσης της τέχνης ήταν πάντα πολύ αυθαίρετες και συχνά υπερβολικά υποκειμενικές.Πρέπει εξετάζοντας ένα έργο να σκεφτούμε τις διαφορές που έχουν οι φυλές, τα έθνη και οι πολιτισμοί. Το αγαπημένο μου κομμάτι είναι το εξής: Θα ήταν πάρα πολύ απλοϊκό να υποθέσει κανείς πως ένας λαός βρίσκεται τυχαία σε μια αποφασιστική για την εξέλιξή του γεωμετρική θέση, όπως θα ήταν ανεπαρκές επίσης να ισχυριστούμε ότι η δημιουργική δύναμη του λαού αυτού σχηματίζεται και κατευθύνεται από τις πολιτικοοικονομικές του συνθήκες. Ο σκοπός της δημιουργικής δύναμης είναι εσωτερικός – και το εσωτερικό δεν εκφράζεται μόνο από τα εξωτερικά δεδομένα.Κάποια στιγμή χάνεται η γραμμή και γεννιέται το επίπεδο κι εκεί δεν μπορούμε να έχουμε ακριβή απάντηση όπως δεν έχουμε απάντηση στο πού τελειώνει ο ποταμός και πού αρχίζει η θάλασσα.Μια σημαντική σκέψη είναι πως όταν βλέπουμε ένα έργο καλό είναι να εμπιστευόμαστε την πρώτη εντύπωση, διότι η αίσθηση κουράζεται γρήγορα και παραχωρεί το πεδίο στη φαντασία. Το καλλιεργημένο μάτι από την άλλη θα πρέπει να είναι ικανό αφ' ενός μεν να βλέπει την επιφάνεια του έργου όπως είναι, και αφ' ετέρου να την αγνοεί όταν αυτή η επιφάνεια εκφράζει το χώρο."

He associates characteristics such as temperature and sound, action and tension to the artist's marks. It can be a bit hard to follow despite it being a pretty easy read. If I were to read this again, I think I would have to be stoned to fully grasp the connections that he makes."

        "user_review": "This review can be found onAmaranthine Reads.We come to the end of theWitcherseries, and I say thank Belzebub for that. It is difficult to say why I kept reading to the very (very) bitter end, since the series was getting increasingly worse by every page. I suppose the time I had invested and a small spark of hope that the end may have been worth it all...The Lady of the Lakeis the final book and it brings the whole saga to an end, with Ciri finding herself in another world having gone through the Tower of Swallows and trying to get back, to find Geralt and somehow end the war that has been ravaging her home.Oh, where to start. If you're wondering whether to read this series, or possible whether to continue reading this series, I will say now that you should not. There have been no improvements since the first few books, and the changes that were made to alleviate those disappointments were far too late and not particularly well done. I'll say now there may be slight spoilers here, but I won't hide the review.We begin with Ciri, who is in \"the land of the elves\", which is spin-doctoring for our world. Ciri is inour world, being spoken to by Galahad and being forced to make love to Oberon (named Auberon here). This is not as far-fetched as the book gets, though it comes close. To make the plot go here is just insane: where did this come from? There has been no mention of our world, no subtle plot device to prepare us for this event and absolutely no indication that this would even be possible. There was never a mention of \"other worlds\" and to have Ciri just suddenly be able to do such a thing is terrible storytelling.Ciri is also still the same pathetic, cantankerous, spoilt character she has always been. I see nothing special about her-except this ridiculous ability-and she hasn't changed during the course of this series. The other characters are also just as flat and two-dimensional as they've always been. It seems as if the plot moves along without them: as if even if they weren't there, what was happening would still be happening. They don't seem to influence much at all.There's little else to say. The dialogue has not improved, the characters-as I said-have no improved and their reasonings and thought-processes are as dull as ever. There are still no women who get along with other women, they all wish to sleep with Geralt or kill any other woman who desires the same and the fact that we are supposed to believe that Geralt and Yennifer's \"love\" is true and wonderful is ridiculous considering that inThe Last Wish(spoiler in the title, by the way) Geraltwishesfor Yennifer's love. Hewishes it in to existence. Their love is based on a pathetic genie wish made during the short story collection that came before this series, and therefore renders their feelings and motives null and void.The ending was also exceeding disappointing and quite frankly pointless. There is also a moment where some characters actually ride off in to the sunset, as if that isn't the most clichéd thing that has ever existed as a plot device. I'm so unhappy with myself for letting me read the entire series, but I suppose I was just hoping and being annoyingly optimistic. And it is quite an easy read, once you get beyond every single man being obsessed with sex and rape. I hope some men who read this are actually offended by that, because if men aren't annoyed that the media think they're obsessed with sex and need tits and legs just to watch or interact with something, then there's no hope at all."

        "user_review": "Let me start by saying that \"Lady of the Lake\" is absolutely a bittersweet, yet fantastic finish to \"The Witcher\" series. I find it very entertaining, yet challenging and deeply rewarding. The major plot points of the series, specifically: Ciri's parentage, destiny, and fate are all addressed and wrapped up rather neatly. I don't want to expound on the plot further than that, not without giving something away that's best left to the joy of discovery. Just read the book. It's worth it!Andrzej Sapkowski clearly draws from the darker side of Polish and European history, using his fantasy setting to explore various aspects of human behavior in a strikingly sophisticated manner. Though immensely gratifying, \"Lady of the Lake\" is deeply unnerving. There are moments when it's touching, romantic, funny, and amusing . At others, it's unbearably sad and utterly terrifying. It's a deeply political book like its predecessors, and racism plays a central role in the narrative, as does misogyny. Another appealing element of the book, and the series, is the moral ambiguity of its power-holders. Nilfgaard is an oppressive, autocratic and megalomaniacal power; yet the Northern kingdoms-- considered to be good, are monstrously violent and cruel places where non-humans are forced to live in ghettos and suffer a lot mundane indignities. Meanwhile, the Elven Scoia'tael, who resist by force of arms, are straight-up terrorists who seemingly take joy from violence against defenseless civilians. Does this dynamic sound familiar? It sure does to me.The book, however, is not excessively grim. There is goodness in the world, as well as in all, but the very worst actors in this drama. And people surprise you -- just when you think you've got things figured out, someone does something unexpected. It may be an unexpected kindness from a character who has hitherto appeared cold and calculating; or someone Geralt or Ciri came to trust, demonstrating why trust, in this world, should be granted prudently.The overarching theory is that the world isn't inherently dark and foreboding --rather, it is corrupted by ignorance, jealousy and the pursuit of power; and human nature can be redeemed in the face of naked self-interest -- through personal bonds of friendship, love and loyalty. These are timeless concepts, and by no means original to the series; yet they are striking nonetheless, by virtue of their flawless execution, and the degree to which we come to care about what happens to Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, and the others.\"The Lady of the Lake\" is also stylistically daring. As in \"The Tower of Swallows\", narratives are often fragmented across several timelines and character perspectives. However, it works better this time. The epic Battle of Brenna shifts between the perspectives of various combatants, and the doctor running a field hospital in its midst. Throughout, Sapkowski intersperses vignettes often centered on peripheral characters, which themselves may link back to events occurring elsewhere. Keeping everything straight can be a challenge, but when the book concludes, the payoff is considerable.The book ends on a curious note but, suffice to say, it raises as many questions as it provides answers.I have my theory and please keep in mind that, amazing as the games may be, I don't consider them as canon:It's clear to me that Geralt and Yennefer died and retired to the afterlife. The whole series seemed to be building up to their inevitable deaths. Think about what Villentretenmerth said to Geralt in \"The Bounds of Reason\":\"Only legends permit what nature condemns. Only myths can ignore the limits of what's possible.\"Or if you think what Yennefer said about elven legends in \"A Shard of Ice\" -- how she was wondering if humans will have ever such beautiful legends about love -- not knowing that one day she will became one of the main protagonist of such legendary tale about love for the next generations…Ciri symbolically dies. After burying Geralt and Yennefer, she realizes the only two people she loved are gone, hence there is nothing left in her homeworld except danger, obligations and life as a pawn. She rejects and abandons her titles, her magical abilities and prior responsibilities by fleeing to a new world. Her last thought before riding off into the sunset with Galahad is, \"I bet this world has jobs for a witcheress\". She is finally free and starts a new life, just what she always wanted as a rebellious, wild-child, and adventurous free spirit.However it's up to you to interpret the ending. Although the death interpretation fully resolves all the themes and arcs that ran their course throughout the series, Sapkowski ultimately left it up to the reader to decide -- because the question of whether they are alive or dead is thematically immaterial and unimportant. Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri transcend life and death, and become myth and legend -- which is what the whole Nimue/Condwiramurs angle was designed to convey.Some people may dislike the ending, but I really love how Sapkowski plays with the ideas and tropes around myths and legends. It evoked profound sadness and child-like joy, and I'll be haunted by this myth for a very long time -- like Nimue.I could go on and on, but really, it all just boils down to this: \"The Witcher\" has become one of my classic favorites alongside Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series."

        "user_review": "2.5 stars.I am so disappointed and angry with how Sapkowski concluded the saga. Throughout the whole series, I've grown so attached to so many characters and I hate to see them stranded away because they couldn't fit the author's weak excuse for a plot. What I hate the most is what happened to Ciri in the end. It's like a slap in the face.This is the final book in the saga and it deals with Ciri finding herself in another dimension, trying to get back to where she belongs. Her focus is to find Geralt and end the war with Nilfgard once and for all. Unfortunately, she is trapped by a group of elves who want to exploit the power of her ancient blood for their own agenda - which definitely won't end up well for her.This book is a devastating conclusion to one of the most interesting fantasy series I've ever read. It has never been the most innovative, but it had unique characters and intelligent humor. Sadly, Sapkowski attempts to bring too many new things to the table. Instead of focusing on the characters like Geralt, Yennefer, and Tris who were shamefully neglected in the previous books, Sapkowski introduces new characters who hold no significance to the plot and live 1000 years AFTER the crucial event.His transitions between times and places are so confusing and repetitive, that it seems like ANOTHER unnecessary filler. I feel betrayed because I have watched the potential of the series disappear without being able to do anything about it. I'm sure the author was quite aware that he couldn't deliver a decent conclusion to that long-standing build-up and high expectations. That ending is an insult of its own with its vagueness and confusion and it's completely ridiculous. The series would've been so much better if it just stayed in short story form.I've grown attached to almost all characters, but by the end, most of them seem two-dimensional, passive, and plainly dumb. Especially, I hate how the author decided to kill off some of the characters. He paid more attention to killing off the villains than to honor the characters who have been actively present in the last few books.Even the main characters made so many out-of-character decisions. For example, Geralt and Yennefer have withstood inexplicable torture and sacrificed so much to protect Ciri and I'm supposed to believe they would just calmly take part in a suicide pact while Ciri gets raped and used?Or how the great emperor Emhyr has murdered countless men, destroyed countries, the world history as he knows it, literally pushed the whole continent into a war to obtain Ciri, just so he would give her up because Yennefer shed a tear? Does the author honestly believe we're that dumb? Or how Ciri was the child of hope and throughout all books, everyone was making great plans for her to conceive a child and she ended up alone with some knight wanting her to become his wife? She deserved so much more. All in all, some plot twists started extremely well and exciting but ended terribly.Geralt is supposed to be a fascinating character, and he is when he isn't brooding - which he is 90% of the time in books 3-7. He was so passive and ready to give up so many times, which is in contrast with everything the readers have seen of him in the previous books. The character development is inconsistent and makes it hard for me to remember why I even fell in love with him in the first place."

Sapkowski attempts to mix in too many new things, his transitions between times and places are very poorly executed and quite overused, and everything about the ending itself is either too much of a cliché, or simply ridiculous.I've stayed with this saga for many years now, and it remains one of my favourites.

        "user_review": "Greetings. Before I, in the spirit of Festivus, get to my grievances, I am going to first say that I really wanted to like the Witcher books. I absolutely loved the games and, so, I wanted to love the books, as well. And I did enjoy the first two books – the compilations of short stories. But then I started the five-book saga, and, man, did the series ever go downhill. I'm unsure whether I would have recommended the saga to others after reading the first four books. However, any doubt evaporated after I read book five. 'Lady of the Lake' ruined the entire saga for me.I. PacingOne major problem with the book is that it has very poor pacing. The plot is a meandering mess. I would argue that of this 531-page novel, at least 200 pages don't involve – even indirectly - the three main characters or their story in any way whatsoever. Ultimately, these extra chapters are nothing but world building. Now, I fully agree that world building is necessary in a story, but there is a proper time and place to do it. I don't believe that adding so much world building in the last book of a five-book saga is the correct time and place. These chapters were a boring distraction. While I was reading them, I just wanted to get back to Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer. In my opinion, the author should've excluded these chapters, and then, after the saga was complete, he could've written a stand-alone novel dealing with the war between Nilfgaard and the Northern kingdoms. (Similar to how CDPR created 'Thronebreaker,' a stand-alone videogame that was separate from the Geralt-focused Witcher games.) If Sapkowski had done that, then that would've given us two separate books that both contained tight plots and interesting, compelling characters that we actually cared about. Instead, we got one, huge muddled book filled with a bunch of superfluous characters and plot-threads that bored me and acted as distractions to the main plot.II. ContrivancesWhen I discuss contrivances, I'm specifically referring to 'Deus ex machina' - events that 'miraculously' resolve some problem for the characters that they seemingly couldn't resolve on their own. I, like most people, find this narrative ploy to be unsatisfying. It's typically a sign of lazy, unimaginative writing. It's a sign that the writer could not come up with a logical and creative way for the protagonist to overcome the obstacle that the writer forced onto the protagonist in the first place.Here are just a few of the many contrivances:A. Ciri is trying to get back to her own world and time in order to save Yennefer, but she just can't figure out how to do it. But, then, she just so happens to arrive – in the future - at the lake with Nimue (who just so happens to be an expert in the 'legend' of Ciri) so that Nimue can then magically open up a portal to Stygga castle so that Ciri can then pass through in order to rescue Yennefer. So, Ciri only found Yennefer through pure blind luck – not through anything she did on her own, but simply because the author needed her to. I'll be honest – it seems as if the entire plot-thread with Condwiramurs and Nimue was only brought into this story simply for this one contrivance. It left me just shaking my head when I read it. I doesn't help that I loathe the use of time-travel as a ploy to solve problems.B. For some reason, Sapkowski wanted all of Geralt's 'fellowship' to die at Stygga castle. And I'm fine with that. I have no issues with characters dying. The problem was that he had earlier in the saga included into the fellowship an incredibly overpowered, almost-immortal vampire in Regis. Regis is a character that can wipe out scores of enemies by himself. We even see him do it within the chapter. So, what does Sapkowski do to deal with this? Easy, he conveniently has Regis leave the rest of the fellowship on multiple occasions so that they can then be killed off. First, Geralt sends Regis to find Ciri (which, I will admit - that actually makes sense within the context of the story, and I'll discuss that more below). While Regis is gone, searching for Ciri, Milva gets killed by a group of bad guys that Regis could have easily dispatched by himself. But then Regis comes back, telling Geralt that he had found and saved Ciri. So, then what does Geralt do? Tells everyone to split up again – even though it makes no sense to do so. So, Regis goes somewhere else by himself leaving everyone else alone so that Cahir and Angouleme can be killed. It's a total contrivance which makes no logical sense. It just happens for plot reasons.Secondly, let's discuss Regis and Ciri: as I said in the previous paragraph, I think it makes sense that Geralt would tell Regis to find and save Ciri because that was the entire purpose of them being there. Heck, that was the entire purpose of the five-book saga – finding and saving Ciri. However, once Regis had found and saved Ciri, it is totally unbelievable that he would then let her go off by herself. In fact, Geralt even tells Regis this, and Regis replies, \"She demanded it. Using a tone and attitude that ruled out any discussion.\" Yeah, right. As if a 400-year-old vampire would be intimidated by a bratty teenager. I don't believe that for one second. It's been shown multiple times in the books that Regis isn't intimidated by anyone, not even Geralt. But, now, he just meekly acquiesces to Ciri's demands? It's nonsense.C. Perhaps the most ridiculous contrivance is how Geralt discovers the location of Stygga castle. In all of the castles in all of the provinces in all the Continent, it just so happens that Skellen and his co-conspirators are meeting in the exact one (and at the exact right time) where Geralt happens to be on a monster contract so that he can overhear them discussing Vilgefortz's location. I just sighed and rolled my eyes after reading that scene. So, he's just hanging out in Beauclair for a couple of months, chilling with his friends, having sex with Fringilla, and completing some monster contracts. In fact, at that point in the story, it actually seems that he's completely forgotten about his search for Ciri, and then, suddenly, this information just miraculously falls into his lap. It's ridiculous. Instead of using a contrivance, how about letting Geralt overcome the obstacle by using his intelligence, skills, and hard work - you know, like a protagonist with some actual agency would do?III. InconsistenciesEven within a fantasy world – in a world of magic or superpowers – things still have to behave in a consistent manner. Otherwise, it just causes confusion and breaks immersion. For example, if I establish that Superman can fly, but later in the story, he inexplicably uses the elevator to get to the top of a building instead of simply flying to the top, then that would cause confusion in the readers. So, whatever 'rules' of the universe that the author creates, they need to be consistent in order to have a satisfying story.Here are just a few of the many inconsistencies:A. Let's look at Ciri's ability to use her power at Stygga castle. First, it is revealed to the reader that the magic at the castle is so powerful that it prevents her from being able to teleport to other times and places. Okay, I'm fine with that. Since Sapkowski never explained exactly how magic works or how Ciri's powers work, then I'm willing to believe that. Except that a few pages later, she miraculously and inexplicably can use her power in order to escape from Bonhart. How did that happen? We don't know. We're never told. But it is now clearly established that she can use her power again. So, then, at the end of the battle, Emhyr's men show up, and now Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer are about to be surrounded. Does Ciri then grab ahold of her two parental figures and teleport away? No, she doesn't. Heck, she doesn't even attempt to do it. She just sits down and gives up. She has this incredible power and she doesn't even try to use it in order to save herself and her loved ones. That's total nonsense.B. Let's look at Yennefer's use of magic at Stygga castle. Earlier in the fight, we see Yennefer using large amounts of magic. So, whatever magic that the castle possessed, it was clearly not affecting her. We also know that Yennefer has the ability to use teleportation magic. We've seen her do it before in the saga. So, even if one wants to argue that, at the end of the battle, the castle's magic was keeping Ciri from using her power in order to teleport away, there is absolutely no good explanation as to why Yennefer wouldn't just quickly open up a portal to allow the three of them to escape. But she doesn't do that. Just like with Ciri, she doesn't even try.C. Let's look at Geralt's use of his Signs – or, more specifically, his lack thereof. This is actually a flaw within the entire saga. After Sapkowski introduces witcher Signs in the two first books (the short story compilations), Geralt pretty much never uses them again. In fact, I could be wrong, but I think he only uses his Signs twice in the entire five book saga. It makes no sense to give this character these great abilities but then never have him use them. At the end of the battle, he and Emhyr speak in a room by themselves with no one else around. At that point, he could have used Axii on the emperor and forced Emhyr to let the three of them go. He should have at least attempted it, but he didn't. He didn't even try.IV. Character BetrayalsIn my opinion, Sapkowski, simply for plot purposes, betrayed his own characters by making them act in ways that are fundamentally opposed to who they are at their core. In the previous section, I already mentioned Regis acting in an inconsistent manner, but now, I'll give three more examples.A. CiriFirst, I think it's very strange that she just surrendered herself over to Vilgefortz with no real plan - thinking that he would then just let Yennefer go. That seems very naïve, which, at that point in the story, Ciri should not be. But, even worse is that, at the end of the battle at Stygga castle, Sapkowski has Ciri just give up. She doesn't even try to save herself, Geralt, and Yennefer once Emhyr's men show up. She doesn't even attempt to use her power in order to have the three of them escape. Once Emhyr's men show up, she just sits down on the steps, lays her sword down, and quits. Sapkowski writes that it was because she – along with Yen - were just \"…terribly tired. And resigned.\" So, she just gives up because she's tired? That seems so off to me. But, to be honest, now that I'm really thinking about her, I've come to realize that her personality is all over the place in this book. She seems to constantly flip-flop back and forth from being a hard-nosed girl who will never allow herself to be taken advantage of to being a spineless character who just gives up in the face of hardship. It's really strange. I'm not sure that she has an actual character arc in this story. It's more of a circle. I would go into detail here, but I'm about to run out of space. But the bottom line is that it makes no sense that she wouldn't at least try to use her power to save Geralt, Yennefer, and herself.B. Emperor EmhyrFor five books, we've seen him act in many ruthless ways. He's also incredibly driven. For the entire saga, we've seen him pursuing Ciri at all costs. He started an intracontinental war just so that he could get his hands on her. He had no problems with hundreds of thousands of people dying in a war so that he could impregnate his own daughter and have a prophecy fulfilled. So, again, he's not a good guy. But, then, there at Stygga castle, he sees Ciri crying and just suddenly has a complete change of heart and decides to let her go. Really? So, because he sees some tears, he decides to scrap his entire plan of fulfilling the prophecy and strengthening the empire? I don't believe that for one second. It was completely out of character.C. Geralt and YenneferFor five books, these two showed that they love Ciri, view her as their child, and will do whatever it takes in order to keep her from harm. They were willing to kill in order to keep her safe. They were willing to die and be tortured in order to keep her safe. That is who they are at their core. And it's not just me who thinks so. At the end of the book, Fringilla Vigo says this about Geralt, \"…more than anything, I'm doing it for Geralt of Rivia, the Witcher, without whom that girl [Ciri] wouldn't be here today. Who, in order to rescue Ciri, went to the end of the world, fighting everything that stood in his way, even himself.\" So, it is a complete betrayal to their characters that Sapkowski would just have them give up, resign themselves to a suicide pact, and allow Emhyr to take Ciri away and impregnate her against her will. That goes against who they fundamentally are. That would be like Sam killing Frodo for the ring or Luke killing Vader and joining Palpatine. It just wouldn't happen. They would have forced Emhyr to kill them before they ever would have agreed to do any of that. They would have done everything in their power – including using their magic and Signs – in order to keep her out of his hands. Given the high rating for this book, then I'm clearly in the minority here, but I will just never consider suicide to be a romantic, honorable, or satisfying choice for a protagonist to make when having to face down the epic conflict in a story. I think it's cowardly, not honorable, and it made me completely lose respect for the characters, which is never a good thing for a reader to feel about the main protagonists of a story. I honestly can't believe that Sapkowski did that to his own characters. It's very weird that I seem to respect and care more about his characters than he does.I know that videogames and books are their own unique forms of media. But one area where they are similar is that they both tell stories. Imagine this scenario in The Witcher 3: it's the epic climax of the story. The Wild Hunt are overwhelming the good guys, when Geralt suddenly yells out, \"Hey, Eredin! I'm really tired right now so I'm just going to lay down my sword and go commit suicide. Go ahead and take Ciri and do whatever you want to with her. Peace out.\" I'm pretty sure that would go down as one of the worst endings in videogame history. And, yet, that exact scenario occurred in the book, and everyone just seems to be fine with it. It's truly confusing.Sapkowski betraying Geralt and Yennefer is what ruined the book for me. It's what ruined the entire saga for me. I'm just very grateful that I was first introduced to Geralt and his universe through the Witcher 3 videogame instead of through the books. Because if I had read the books first, I probably would have never even bothered to play the games.Of course, all of this is just my opinion. I could be wrong. Regardless, I truly hope that you enjoyed the saga more than I did."

        "user_review": "I honestly tried to find the truly negative aspects about this book. I honestly did. But when it came to the dreamlike aspects, the tie-ins and total subversion of the tiny bits of the Arthurian Legend, or when it came to finding this to be a weak Witcher novel...?Eh. No. It was very strong. Strong enough to keep my attention fully rapt from start to finish.I mean, who DOESN'T like Ciri as a badass? She sure went through a ton of changes and misfortunes. All that extremely well done prophesy buildup from the first books, the way Yennefer and Geralt would do anything for her, or how the entire mess played out, lead to one of the best, most disturbing passages of full-out war I've read in a fantasy series. (And that's including Tolkein, mind you.)But perhaps I'm not focusing on the right thing. What I should be pointing at is the future-timeline jumps, the little speeches from old survivors, the way the past is remembered or misremembered. These are the writings that pulled me under the lake and drowned me. It put everything... and I mean everything into perspective. We get the crap, the idealism, the hopeful, the romantic... and THEN we get the real, heartbreaking story.And no. I'm not going to spoil what becomes of Yennefer and Geralt. I'll just say I cried. If you want to know more, then damn you, READ THE BOOK. :)*smacks lips* So tasty.One other thing: the writing style is NOT very traditional, but it IS evocative. I really appreciate how this series is UNLIKE most epic fantasy. It's much smarter than I think most people give it credit. :)"

        "user_review": "This is the final tale in the dark fantasy series The Witcher, and all though it had a decent start the ending will, no doubt, disappoint many readers. The idea that the truths of ancient history and mythology can be unearthed by exploring them in the dreams of a talented sleeper is rather enchanting. It's an interesting idea, one that merges history and fantasy creating an almost dream like feel within the writing, though it never delivers what it promises.The fantasy elements in here are predominantly dark and twisted. Not a bad thing of course. Just because it's a dream it doesn't mean it's going to be a pleasant one for the characters involved. This isn't a book about glorious forests and magnificent scenery in which good always conquers evil. No. This is a book about opportunists. It's a story about how people will always try to use others if it means they might have a chance for more power. Such is Ciri's strand of the story. She is entrapped by a group of elves who wish to harness the power of her ancient blood, by breeding her to create an offspring they can wield for their own advantage. Not very nice at all, though they have overlooked Ciri's own opportunist nature and her will to survive. She's not a woman to take this in her stride. Indeed, she bides her time and looks for an opportunity to escape.Geralt, on the other hand, is enjoying life for the first part of the book. He has a new romance, though such a thing could only ever be temporary. There's only one woman he will truly love, and finding her again becomes his only purpose. But Ciri is far removed from his life and reuniting with her will lead him on a perilous journey. Fans of the video games will know all too well that his day job is hunting monsters; he puts this aside for a while and embarks on a bigger quest. The two separate strands drove the narrative forward as they grew ever closer. The relationship between the two characters was the strongest aspect of the book.The events may seem far removed from the legend the title of the book references. It begins with a retelling of this element of the Arthurian myth, though Sapkowski gives it his own twist. He blends the history with the fantasy, creating a unique world. However, towards the end it did become a little confusing at points. It all felt vague and extremely fragmented, but I suppose that's what happens with dreams. The story telling was not as precise as the early books in the series, and the structure was a little clunky. It was hard to tell when events were happening in relation to each other, and at times the book felt like a series of connected short stories or novellas rather than the full novel it was trying to be this time round. The ending too will likely disappoint many readers with its sheer lack of punch and open ended nature.I did enjoyed parts of this book, though it did have many problems. I only recommend this to those that have read all the previous books in the series; this is most certainly a conclusion, as weak as it was, rather than a stand-alone novel.-I received an arc of this book from The Bookbag in exchange for an honest review."

        "user_review": "Interesting but slightly disappointing, after six books I expected more. The annoying thing is that it was something small that ruined this book, and that thing isdrum rollsthe story telling/ writing style. If the author had used the style he used in the previous book this would have been way better. There was well depicted fight scenes, new worlds, awesome characters and plot in this.Verily do I tell you that whoever believes in dreams is as one trying to catch the wind or seize a shadow. He is deluded by a beguiling picture, a warped looking glass, which lies or utters absurdities in the manner of a woman in labour. Foolish indeed is he who lends credence to dreams and treads the path of delusion.Nonetheless, whoever disdains and does not believe them at all also acts unwisely. For if dreams had no import whatsoever why, then, would the Gods, in creating us, give us the ability to dream?The world building is amazing, I really enjoyed the depiction. The writing oh Lord its the worst, the story was told was different sides, it started from the end, the beginning then what was supposed to be the middle of the story was at the end, why the author adapted this style I have no idea.The characters as always are awesome with coo personalities, since this is a fantasy some of my well loved characters died. Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer finally lived up to my expectations for them. Cahir, Regis, Milva, Anglomelue and Dandelion were also here. I wish they have more page space than they did.The plot that was supposed to be straight forward started with Ciri in a weird world then she started telling her story. Instead of the story to follow a normal progress the author changed POV to a new character hundreds of years later after Ciri's time. This new character is trying find out what happened to Ciri, Geralt and Yennefer. Once again POV was changed to a new character who is a soldier in the war with Nilfgaard, this part was slightly fun to read but again POV was changed. It was so sporadic that even though things came together in the end I did not appreciate it. I'd rather it was a conventional storytelling style.I'm still confused about that ending."

        "user_review": "Prior to reading the first book in this series I was very, very convinced that these books would end up being among the best in the worst genre to pick books from. I finished the first three, and they were perfect. They had everything that a fantasy novel should have, maybe not could ever have, but I always put a lot of expectation on what I would read and the first three titles hit the mark.An interesting world, painted with vivid imagery without clunky paragraphs of overwhelming description, realism within fantasy, a lot of philosophy, of humor, of adventure, all presented with mind of the culture and the plotline that serves as a nice, neat framework for all that.While those three were great, I can only say that the last two could be better. The last one,The Lady of the Lake, was disappointing.The problem with this series is that it felt like one ENORMOUS tumour had begun to manifest in it by the end of the second book, and grew to full form at the fifth. That tumour's Ciri, by the way. I truly loved her character from the beginning, but by the end I felt like the author didn't even bother to sugar-coat the fact that she had evolved into a very obnoxious Mary-Sue. The thing is I wouldn't have minded any of that had her Mary-Sueness not manipulated the plot into something mundane, something dull and dulling and justso mundane.Here is why-the plot was wrapped up only with Ciri in mind. I know she is supposed to be the main character from the very beginning, so no problem with that, but was it necessary to kill off anyone else who had no place in her \"happy\" ending? Was it necessary to reduce wonderful, intelligent, proud and charismatic characters to fools beneath her? Was it necessary to have every conflict in the books resolved or completely thrown away into disregard for her, because of her? That's just so pretentious.It felt like the author wrote her with the intention of making her a legendary figure, but ended up making it look like generic self-insert fanfiction.Fanfiction written with increasingly faltering bouts of creativity, by the way, because you know, it's always great to draw from myth and folklore when writing fiction, but to do so in a way that it seems like copy and pasting, rather than re-telling or bringing new colour to the story, just honestly cheapens it. Or perhaps the mythic elements were cheapened because of the omnipresence of a flamboyant Mary-Sue? With the myth concerning the Elvenking, it felt like that. A legendary, otherworldly creature, so cold and powerful and proud, left to snorting crack and reading porn andOD'ing from viagrajust to force himself to have sex with Ciri and beget the saviour and destroyer of worlds. (?????... ?????) Absurd, and frustrating...It's disheartening, because I really, really wanted so much more for such a promising character and for such a promising end to a beautifully-written world. I adored and admired almost all the characters, an obvious indicator of skill on the author's behalf you know, but by the end they were made lame, \"pathetic\", simple and dumb. I fell in love with the world, but then you see at the end that the world actually sucks so bad that you wouldn't even want to live in it.Bad mistakein a fantasy book.So yeah... here I lay my disappointment and my frustration, because I had so much hope, and so much admiration for these books. I do recommend these above the average fantasy novel, but I can only really allow praise to the first three, and indifferent grunts of recognition for the last two."

        "user_review": "I have so many thoughts after reading this final installment of the Witcher saga.The beginning of this book dragged on forever. Ciri is running around in Avalon, an entire different universe. I could care less about Condwiramurs, a woman who dreams about the legends of the Witcher in the future, and yet we return to her chapter after chapter. This is one of my main complaints throughout the book. There is so much time dedicated to new and minor characters, while the main characters' lives (and especially deaths!) are glossed over. Less of Nimue, Pretty Kitty, etc... and more of Milva, Regis, Cahir, and even the sorceress's guild... would have been appreciated. A lot of time is also wasted on philosophical ramblings. While the gray morality theme has been enjoyably present in all of the witcher books, it has not previously been stated outright and over and over again by a slew of minor characters. The theme was just beaten to death in this novel.Point of view switches non-stop. We jump to the past, to the future, to historical texts, and back again in an unconnected way. The story of the witcher has become legend instead of a straightforward story. Did Geralt die of a heart attack in old age? Or a pitchfork in the present?Geralt's time with Fringilla Vigo does not fit his character. That he would waste away his winter in that castle and resume his activities as a witcher, even under enchantment, is slightly unbelievable. The way that he learns of Vilgefortz's location is pretty convenient and just serves to push the plot forward out of the mire.Ciri is more and more unlikable. Her time with the elves is borderline bawdy and unnecessary to the plotline.In the epic battle in Vilgefortz's hideout, many characters act...out of character. For example, Regis does not jump headfirst into anything. Geralt and Yennefer have withstood torture, grievous wounds, and much more in order to protect Ciri, so their easy, calm, and romantic suicide pact while Ciri gets dragged of to be raped by her father is just NOT plausible. Emhyr has murdered countless individuals and literally plunged a continent into war and more in order to obtain Ciri, so the site of tears changing his mind is mind-bogglingly unbelievable. What an odd way to get the characters out of the situation. The mushy and constant declarations of love being traded between Ciri, Geralt, and Yennefer are also completely out of character.And then... the final scene. It is written as to be undecipherable. I read it, reread it, and then closed the book with baffled question marks over my head.Overall, just not the conclusion that I would have hoped for. Over time, the series lost its endearing wit and charm and became overly detailed, bleak, and ridden with political turmoil. This doesn't change the fact that Geralt, as well as many others, are great characters. I just wish the books would have progressed in the same vein that they started."

Ali način na koji Sapkovski to radi svež je i - za mene - inovativan u ovom žanru. Umesto da da omaž piscima i književnim likovima, Sapkovski im daje novi život, reinterpretira njihova dela na način koji može da znači jedino da se prokleto dobro zabavljao pišući ovaj serijal i smišljajući razne sarkastične nepodopštine. Verovatno i sam umoran od prežvakavanja stalno istih motiva, ostaje mi samo da pretpostavljam da je Sapkovski odlučio da se podrugne takvoj spisateljskoj praksi i, poput kritike, podari nam likove koji nimalo skriveno predstavljaju antipode svojim originalima iz sveta književnosti: pa tako imamo Snežanu sa bandom od sedam drumskih razbojnika, kralja vilenjaka Oberona koji je frustrirajuće impotentan i ne može da podari naslednika svom narodu, vampira vegetarijanca koji se, u procesu skidanja sa krvi, čak bavi i proizvodnjom rakije... vešto uplićući takve minijature u priču, Sapkovski ne preteruje čak ni onda kada se učini da je \"ovoga puta zaista preterao\". Em, uglavnom.Takođe, jedan od aduta žanra epske fantastike jeste i vezivanje čitalaca za krajnje živopisne likove koji, prolazeći sito i rešeto, sazrevaju, uče, bore se, tuguju, raduju se, a zajedno sa njima i mi, čitaoci, željni eskapističkog predaha uz avanture nekog imaginarnog sveta. Sapkovski i ovde briljira. Za razliku od Tolkina, čiji su likovi visokoparne figure, više simboli nego likovi osmišljeni da budu \"životni\" i skloni slabostima i temperamentinim reakcijama, za razliku od Džordanovih dvodimenzionalnih, šabloniziranih likova koji reaguju nelogično i iritantno bez obzira na stalež i narod, a strogo ukalupljenih po svom polu, kao i za razliku od Martinovih kraljeva, kraljica i vlastele, u serijalu koji uopšte ne uzima u obzir \"male ljude\", Sapkovski je uspeo da zahvati iz bunara raznolikosti izuzetno velikom kofom - pa tako imamo i kraljeva, i kraljica, i seljaka, i lovaca, i kriminalaca, i vojskovođa, i čarobnjaka, i čarobnica, i prosjaka, i sveštenstva... a svi oni, shodno logici, slede neke svoje, sopstvene puteve, i u svojoj raznovrsnosti su (uglavnom) potpuno uverljivi i deluju maltene opipljivo, stvarno, kao da su građeni po nekim primerima, uzorima koje je pisac možda (ko će ga znati) imao u svojoj okolini. Smeju se, plaču, vole, mrze, tvrdoglavi su ili mudri, pametni ili glupi, drski ili blagi, uče, prave greške, rade dobro, rade loše, i sve to u skladu sa dodeljenim im karakterima. Moj naklon za ovo.Odlučujući se za motiv provokativnosti koji bi njegovu Sagu mogao da istakne u odnosu na druge serijale, Sapkovski je, po mom skromnom mišljenju, načinio pun pogodak, opredelivši se da nam opisuje sve one ogavne stvari koje se obično preskaču u ovakvim pričama, i stavljajući svoje likove u situacije sasvim surove i, nažalost, realne, u skladu sa događanjima opisanim u knjizi. Tako se, na primer, nije libio da opiše kako je prelepa čarobnica Tris Merigold imala proliv, kako se Jenefer upiškila u bazenu, kako je slavna Temerijska vojska kopala nužnike na putu ka bojnom polju, kako Ciri briše slinav nos rukavom, kako se Geralt napije kao krmak od votke. Za razliku od Martinovog serijala koji seks koristi kao \"spice-it-up\" dodatak priči, Sapkovski seksu prilazi trezvenije i, rekla bih, manje uspaljeno od američkog kolege. Seks je ne samo uživanje, već i oruđe moći, alatka kojom se manipuliše, ali i oružje represije, ponižavanja i tlačenja u slučajevima silovanja i zločina tokom rata. Sapkovski se ne libi da nam gadarije koje ljudi rade poturi pod nos i kaže \"izvol'te, i ovo smo mi\".Suma sumarum, što se tiče hvale namenjene ovoj sagi, zadivljujuće je kako je Sapkovski naizgled jednostavno, promenama u načinu pripovedanja (sa pravolinijskog pričanja priče prelazi na flashbackove, i vice versa; menjanjem POV likova, uključujući time različite \"tabore\", staleže, polove, profesije, vrste), uspeo da obuhvati celokupan haos koji nastaje prilikom izbijanja rata između dve velike vojne sile. Širinu teritorije koja tom prilikom strada, načine na koji svaki od staleža/naroda/polova pri tome trpi, kao i sveobuhvatne posledice koje takav jedan sukob izaziva. Nema dobrih i loših momaka u ratu. Rat je rat, a diplomatija samo njegova produžena ruka.Naravno, nije sve baš savršeno u ovoj Sagi. Negde na početku, umeo je Sapkovski debelo da zagazi u patetiku i moralizatorske propovedi iskazane izveštačenim i pretencioznim monolozima. Umeo je Sapkovski da ostavi neke stvari nedorečene, izluđujući nedorečene, pretpostavljajući, valjda, da to što se likovi u knjigama nekako razumeju i ćutanjem, podrazumeva da i čitaoci shvate šta bi to ćutanje trebalo da znači. Lutao je Sapkovski poprilično dok nije pronašao neki čvrst, utaban put, kojim je sigurno krenuo i doveo priču do kraja, oslobodivši se nekako usput \"dečjih bolesti\" u pripovedanju, tako vidljivih na početku serijala. Bilo je možda nekih delova koji su zaslužili da se osmisle ili ispričaju malo drugačije. Ali, i pored nekih nategnutih i zdrljanih rešenja, ne mogu se oteti utisku da je Sapkovski od samog početka znao gde i kako priča treba da se završi.Znati dobro završiti priču podjednako je važno kao i znati započeti je. Toliko."

        "user_review": "\"Destiny isn't the judgements of providence, isn't scrolls written by the hand of a demiurge, isn't fatalism. Destiny is hope. Being full of hope, believing that what is meant to happen will happen.\"No, that wasn't me laying in a fetal position crying last night while my husband tried to hold me and soothe away my pain. No, I didn't stay up fighting sleep way past my bedtime to finish this book. I'm shattered. I'm heartbroken.💔This was the last official book of the series (not including the standalone book Season of Storms that released years later which I shall read later this year once the pain has diminished some.) So, I did it! It was an extremely long journey, so finishing this book made me cry for one than one reason. I shall list them all below:§ I was utterly consumed by nostalgia reaching the end when I really started realizing it was really finally over. I went through hell and back with these characters and rooted for so many of them for so long.§ THAT ENDING….killed me….talk about a bittersweet, open-to-interpretation, slap-in-the-face kind of ending!!!! Ahhhhhh!!! WHY!?!? I do realize (and accept…) not all endings can be happy, but I feel I was deprived and betrayed. Anyway, that's life. I know. But still. I suppose I can try to lean more on the happier side of the possible open interpretation, but it's just hard to accept when the grim reality competes to set in. Thus, I shall eternally be disappointed I'm sure.§ I may have shipped two characters (my lips are sealed - I won't say which two to avoid spoilers) since the last book when a certain something was revealed, and they NEVER got their opportunity. They finally got their MOMENT in this book, a single sacrificing moment during which I believe one party never even realized the true extent of the other's feelings. That shatters my entire existence. Ahhh!!!! Why?!?!§ The agony started around the 60-65% mark at the climax and continued on to the end. It was emotionally tortuous!Honorable Mentions:∆ I was happy to see Geralt returning to his Witcher roots in this book as he has been pretty lost in the last couple of books. It made me so happy that he kind of found himself before everything else happened.∆ Loved, loved, loved the touch of Arthurian legend tied into this book!! Although sadly, I have to say I was at a slight disadvantage because I'm not too terribly familiar with the details of the Arthurian legend other than the experience I had watching the show Merlin a few years ago! But I solemnly swear I shall learn more very soon. It's extremely intriguing!!Do I still recommend this series? Yes, I absolutely do!! It's an epic fantasy world with complex plots and addicting characters. It's a grand journey with tons of ups and downs. It's cleverly written, and the dedication bleeds. Completely unforgettable! I'm so proud of myself for finishing the series!⚔️ Geralt will always be my Witcher! ⚔️ 🪙I suppose after I pick up the pieces of what's left of my soul from the agony of finishing the series, I should really read that standalone book and delve back into the Witcher 3 game. I've heard the game takes place after the events of the books. So maybe I can find some hope…."

Die Kapitel sind ja bei Herrn Sapkowski sowieso schon immer elendig lang und wenn das Kapitel dann gefühlt gar nichts zum Plot beträgt und der Inhalt auch in 3-4 Sätzen hätte erzählt werden können... :/Nach dem ersten Drittel wurde es zum Glück aber besser und spannender. Es wurden zwar nicht wirklich viele Fragen beantwortet, sondern auch immer wieder neue Rätsel aufgeworfen, allerdings habe ich bei dieser Reihe auch das Gefühl, dass es an mir liegt, dass ich nicht alle Feinheiten und Hintergründe verstehe. Kennt ihr das Gefühl, zu dumm für ein Buch zu sein? :DNichtsdestotrotz eine epische Reihe, die grade in diesem Band noch viele Überraschungen und Plottwists parat hält. Die Geschichte ist einfach raffiniert, komplex und detailreich erdacht und erzählt. Kann für mich definitiv mit George R.R. Martin mithalten."

And as every time I'm sad because, as Ciri used to say, it's just not fair. It's over. But the war is not over, the evil is not gone and it will never be, but there will be no Witcher to fight it. Because that world didn't deserve that Witcher. Will Ciri come back to save it? I don't think so. The question remains unanswered. For you to guess.While I understand some critics I can't do nothing else but love the book, even more than before. Love the series, love the characters. Even though I think that it's unfair (again!) that Sapkowski went full g.r.r.martin on some of them... Mind you, before it was cool.Happy to have read it again. Till next time, Witcher! <3"

        "user_review": "3.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctumhttps://bibliosanctum.com/2017/04/13/...Eighteen years after its original publication in Polish, this concluding volume of The Witcher series finally has its official English translation. While fan translations have been around for quite a while now, honestly I thought it was well worth the wait, if nothing else because I got to enjoy the excellent audiobook edition. I started off by reading the books, but then on a whim decided to switch formats once I got to Baptism of Fire and never looked back.Anyway, the final book of a series is always something special. By this time, the story has taken over your mind and the characters have wormed their way into your heart. While endings can be a delight, oftentimes they are also bittersweet, because you've had so much fun on this adventure but now it's time to say farewell. You start to wonder to yourself what the long awaited finale might be like: will it be everything you ever wanted, or fall short of expectations?Well, in the case of The Lady of the Lake, my thoughts were mixed. The story begins cryptically, with Sir Galahad of Arthurian legend fame stumbling upon Ciri bathing in a pond. After the knight mistakes her for the Lady of the Lake which causes Ciri to correct his error, the two of them start talking and she begins to recount the tale of what she has been up to since the Tower of Swallows. It seemed that the portal she entered there had taken her to a different world, one where the Elves reigned. Seeing that she was trapped and at his mercy, the Elven king had proposed a bargain: Ciri could have her freedom…but only if she would agree to bear his child.Meanwhile, back in her home world, the northern armies and the Nilfgaardian forces are still at war. In the middle of all this, Geralt and his companions are also continuing their search for Ciri, but with the recent abduction and imprisonment of Yennefer, the Witcher now has even more troubles on his hands.It vexes me admit this, but The Lady of the Lake was probably the most confusing of all the books. Not that any of them have shown much linear storytelling, but for this one Sapkowski takes devices like flashbacks, dream sequences, POV switches and time jumps to extremes. This not only made the book feel very disjointed and hard to follow, it also dampened my enthusiasm for the story especially when we went on wild tangents that added zilch to the main plot or followed characters I could not care less about. If it were up to me, I would also have axed much of the ending. In my opinion, too much of the fluff that came after the climax spoiled a lot of the impact.Now that I've gotten my complaints out of the way though, here's what I did like: 1) Pretty much any scene where Ciri or Geralt and any of his companions or key characters appeared was topnotch. These are the characters I've come to know throughout the series and I found it hard to stay focused whenever the attention shifted away to anyone else. 2) Despite all the jumping around we do, there was at least a sense that final volume was trying to pull everything together; whether it's a nod to events in the previous books or tying up loose ends and bringing things full circle, the narrative made an earnest attempt at closure. 3) All the references to fairy tales, myths and legends. This was one of the aspects I fell in love with when I first picked up The Last Wish so long ago, and it just seemed so apt for this last book to bring me back to those memories. 4) The action sequences were amazing. Obviously, it's great anytime we get to see Geralt or Ciri kicking ass, but there was also this one epic scene depicting a huge battle which I thought was really well done, transporting the reader into the thick of the fighting.Overall the book's strengths outweighed the weaknesses, ultimately making The Lady of the Lake an enjoyable if flawed read. It wasn't my favorite book of the series, and as an ending, it definitely wasn't as good as what I'd hoped for. Still, I don't regret reading it at all. Taken as a whole, The Witcher is a superb series, and I would certainly not discourage anyone to try these books just because I wasn't a hundred percent pleased with this concluding volume; after all, you'd be missing out on many more great moments on this epic journey. In spite of everything, it was well worth it to see this saga through to the end.Audiobook Comments: As always, Peter Kenny brings his best. His narration was a big reason why I stuck with the audiobooks for this series, because when he reads he brings the stories and characters to life. The Witcher books are also generally pretty well suited for this format, I find, because of their nonlinear structure, and the stories just seem to flow more smoothly and are less distracting when I'm listening. So if you're considering tackling this series with the audiobooks, I say go for it; truly I can't recommend them highly enough."

And we awake from such dreams screaming.\"The Last Wish ★★★★Sword of Destiny ★★★★Blood of Elves ★★★ 1/2The Time of Contempt ★★★ 1/2Baptism of Fire ★★★ 3/4The Tower of Swallows ★★The Lady of the Lake ★★As you can see the Witcher series did not meet my expectations and it ended up with 2 stars which is a bummer! I would have DNFed this book if it wasn't the finale but I powered through and took some extra measures to go through it.I don't think I am a big fan of Sapkwoski's writing. The best books were the first two short story collections because they have a self contained story that is not very hard to follow. The problem is that the author's writing is dense and full of info dumping of places and people who we are supposed to remember for the rest of the series. I have heard a lot of negative things about the ending and I was slowly going through this until I decided to read a full summary of the book to see if it is worth continuing and I found that the way it ended is not very disappointing but the path toward that ending is.I had trouble following the story in the previous books and it was the same here. The book is told from multiple POV and through dreams which sounds cool but can get tiring when you try to fit everything in its place. To be honest, I skimmed Jarre and Rusty's parts which I have never done before but I simply did not care about characters that I have heard about in book 7 only.Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer are main characters here and I can digest how their arcs end but I think many things were done very conveniently and not in a convincing way. Like Sapkowski did not know what to do so he just went with the flow making many story lines underwhelming. The book was too lengthy anyway and had redundant parts that could have been told instead of showed (Yes it is a rare situation where the general rule doesn't apply).I have also just finished watching the second season of the series and I am happier with how the TV series is going. The story is easier to follow and there are monsters and magic which is essential to the story but is not a big part of the later books.Summary:I am disappointed with how things were handled in this book. The book was too long with many descriptions that get repetitive quickly. There are info dumps as usual. Characters that I did not care about had big parts of the book where the ones I did care about where handled quickly and not in a convincing way. I am more excited to see how the producers turn it into more seasons of the series!"

However, I feel like some untapped potential died with the end of this series, and I'll carry that disappointment with me for a while.There were so many new threads explored in the final novel of The Witcher saga that I wish had been left out in favour of more time spent with our favourite characters. I think that is mostly what feels unjust here. That, and I'm not entirely sure what some of these parts even meant. Sapkowski has always masterfully handled multiple time frames and locations, but I found myself for the first time wondering what was going on, where and when we were, and why the things that happened, happened.That said, I don't feel entirely let down as I think the ending included some of the things that I've wished for, albeit not in entirely the manner I'd imagined.So it goes.Reading Order:1.The Last Wish (short story collection)2. The Sword of Destiny (short story collection)0. [Season of Storms]3. The Blood of Elves (novel)4. The Time of Contempt (novel)5. Baptism of Fire (novel)6. The Tower of Swallows (novel)7. The Lady of the Lake (novel)0. [Season of Storms]There are a few options for when to read Season of Storms, but I'll leave it at these two."

        "user_review": "I'm disappointed. It took me a few days to reach that conclusion because I love The Witcher books, I tremendously enjoy Sapkowski's writing and I really did not want to be disappointed.The whole book felt rushed, as if desperately trying to close all the plot lines. The result is some loose ends, some deus ex machinas (one particularly horrible - look below) and some plot lines that started with a bang and ended with a feeble voice.Sapkowski is extremely talented at quickly introducing new characters and their stories. You get interested and attached in just a few pages. That is what makes his short stories so great. But here he just overdoes it: It's the longest book in the series with many half-baked resolutions, yet so many pages are dedicated to new side-characters that are irrelevant to the main plot in all ways but adding atmosphere.Now some grunts, beware of SPOILERS:Geralt discovers the info he's been seeking for 3 books because he just happen to monster-hunt in a cave where Skellen and his co-conspirators are having a meeting?! In a remote corner of the world, entirely unrelated to the conflict? Because it is not involved in political affairs so there are no spies in it? Seriously?What's with all the Falka build up from the previous books? nothing, we don't talk about it.How come Emhyr did not initially know the location of Vilgefortz' hideout - he apparently visited it.The battle of Brenna is a complete mess. Why did the north win? Numbers? Training? Brilliant tactics? I don't know, they just won. Menno Coehoorn, supposedly the greatest tactician that ever lived. Emhyr var Emreis, the white flame dancing on the barrows if his enemies, emperor of the greatest human empire to ever exist and a brilliant strategist. Somehow they both find themselves in the mud of the northern kingdoms with no plan. Lots of build up on those characters and poor resolution.What really happened at Soden hill? Specifically to Triss. Again, lots of talk about her apparent resurrection in the previous books and not a word of explanation."

The beginning was kind of slow with too much world and time hopping for my taste. But the middle part was great! The ending though... There's nothing that hasn't been resolved but still I feel like there was something missing. I still like the ending itself but the book as a whole was underwhelming."

It was vivid and really brought you into the world as a whole. Toussaint in particular was exceptional as were some other places especially those frequented by Ciri. Just outstanding.The characters were brilliant especially Ciri. This really was mostly about her which was great. She is by far the most interesting of then all. Geralt was great though as always as were many other characters. This really is one of the best things about this series as the cast is so captivating and interesting.The plot was complex but not too much so really kept the surrpises coming. Plenty of action, twists, political disccours and commentary and a very good pace. For those who loved the games - if you think you know what is happening in the Witcher world you don't unless you have read the books.Overall a brlliant book and I have enjoyed this series very very much.I'm also very glad i've reached my reading goal this year as I don't think i'll be doing much reading for the next ilittle while. The Witcher game has been calling for a while and it's time to see it with some new insights.I highly recommend this series for all readers of fantasy and medieaval action. There are some adult themes and a lot of gore but no more so than the games.Its captivating, interesting and bound to be talked about more after the Netflix series airs."

It doesn't fit with the rest of the series, and wasn't developed enough to really add anything other than breaking up the narrative."

        "user_review": "The final installment in the main Witcher stories starts right where we left off, with Ciri, Yen and Geralt separated. Each are searching for the other, and the conclusion will see worlds collide and destinies fulfilled.Ciri is stuck in another world, one filled with Elves who hate humans yet still want to impregnate Ciri and keep her child because of a prophecy that her offspring will be the saviour of worlds. The one who will stop the white frost. In all honestly, it gets a bit weird and creepy given Ciri's age and the sexual tone these takes. Until we encounter Little Horse, my favourite unicorn, and his herd of badass unicorns who seem to have some kind of vendetta against the Elves. I loved seeing Little Horse (they're real name I can neither say nor spell) and I still think that Ciri's overall story ARC is the most interesting. She's grown into her abilities, and her experiences have made her compassionate yet with a steely undertone.While Ciri is off exploring other worlds, Yen is still imprisoned and tortured by her enemies. Yen is such a strong character, one who believes whole heartedly in her beliefs and opinions. She's prickly yes, and hard to love, but she's never afraid to stand up for her principles and defend those she loves. She also gets some of the best lines. Geralt by comparison is shagging his way through the idyllic Toussant, while his motley crew are desperate for him to return to the search for Ciri. One chance encounter soon gets Geralt back on track, but I couldn't help feeling a little let down by Geralt and his plot. His story is by far the slowest, sometimes edging towards boring, and a bit meandering.The plot does pick up after the halfway point, with a series of rather epic showdowns involving characters we've seen throughout the series coming back to face rather fitting conclusions. We have Sharni, Zolton, Dandelion, as well as the various ladies from the Lodge of Sorceresses. I do think most of them get a good send off (with a few tear filled massacres of well loved characters along the way). After this big build up howeverfrr, I found the last part of the book goes back to meandering and almost limps towards the end. Yen and Geralt get a Co clusion of sorts, but I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about it. I think I prefer the ending we get in the games.That said, I'm sad that this series has ended (except for the prequel I have left to read) and I'll genuhuuinely miss Ciri, Yennefer and Geralt on their adventures. And I hope they're happy, wherever they are."

        "user_review": "This book. This. Fucking. Book. You see all those other reviews talking about how it was unputdownable, and how they never believed something so cliche before this book? You know how you're rolling your eyes right now at those comments? Stop it. They are all true. This book handily usurped Gone Girl as the best book I have read in the past year. Make no mistake, however, this book is absolutely heartwrenching in so many ways I cannot describe absent spoilers.This book is many things, which makes it incredibly difficult to genre classify. It is a poignant story about a single mother and successful career woman (Kate) doing the best she can to raise daughter, but following Amelia's death, she cannot escape her own regrets and guilt over what happened, feeling like had she been a better parent, she could have prevented it.It is also a beautiful coming of age tale for 15 year old Amelia, as well as several of the tertiary teenage characters, and explores first love and heartbreak, and the bonds of friendship anbd loyalty, in a delicate and beautiful, yet highly realistic, way.Perhaps most important, this is a book about secrets. Secrets abound in this book. Everyone has a secret, and by the end, you will know their secrets too. Portions of the book have a very Gossip Girl feel, and I mean that in the best way possible. The reader is provided juicy tidbits of gossip as the story unfolds, and these developments are made in such a way that you can't help but want to hear more, because it gives true insight into the world Amelia lived in, and the person she was. The pacing was absolutely excellent.The story vacillates between events unfolding in the present and events that occurred in the past. Each chapter is narrated by either Kate or Amelia, except those in an epistolary format, constructed through texts, and facebook and blog posts. I found this a brilliant formatting choice, as the story unfolded for the reader practically simultaneously as it did for Kate.Oh god, the characters in this book. So real, so multi-faceted. So relatable. Even the more \"cliched\" characters had dimensions and layers. I don't have kids, but I truly felt for Kate. My heart broke for her. Perhaps it is because for a portion of my life I was raised every day by a single mom, working a full time job, who often had to leave me with babysitters until early evening. I can understand that a mother may feel guilty about that, even if many people, her children included, do not believe that she should. Likewise, I strongly identified with Amelia, who fully understood why her mom was so absentee.This book really drilled home the point that the quality of the time they spent together mattered so much more than the quantity. The emotions in this book. Oh, they run the gamut - jealousy, betrayal, hatred, admiration, and love. There is so much love in this book. The love Kate and Amelia feel for each other oozes off the pages. I won't say much more about the nuanced emotions and relationships present in the book, lest I spoil.Also, it appears that high school girls are still bitches. I graduated before household internet was mainstream; before AOL's seemingly self-replicating floppies provided millions of households with free coasters. High school tormenting was much more covert in those days, rumors spread through whispers and giggles in the hallway, and you just hoped that the rumors died before proliferating throughout the school. This book makes deft use of the ways in which the digital age have changed the rumor mill, and thus, changed the ways in which high schoolers can torment each other in perpetuity. Nothing dies on the internet. The digital footprint is always there. Makes it much harder to forget and move onto the next rumor.Ultimately, I cannot recommend this book enough. I was only about 80 or 100 pages in last night when I curled up in bed with my Nook, as I do every night, planning to read a couple chapters as I fell asleep. Next thing I knew, I was 150 pages in, it was pretty late, but I could read \"just one more chapter.\" Then 200...then 300...by the time I finished, it was far later than I should ever be awake during the week, but I regret not one moment of it."

        "user_review": "Here are my pervasive thoughts as I read this book:1 - Gillian Flynn, you should be offended within every inch of your life.2 - I can see how a puppet show could be entertaining, but not when all you see is the marionette pulling the strings and3 - I am coining a new term - Offensive Apologetics - to encapsulate much - but by no means all - of what is wrong with this book.To address 1 - Ms. Flynn penned a successful hit entitled Gone Girl which, while gimmicky and over the top, was engaging and well crafted. For reasons that I cannot begin to fathom, Reconstructing Amelia (or deconstructing, or at least, that is what I will be doing) has been compared with that book and I am personally horrified, considering how much work clearly went into Gone Girl, and, well.2 and also 3 because they go very much hand in hand, to be touched upon as I outline the staggeringly and embarrassingly unlikely plot:When I first opened this book, having not read the binding, but ordered it from the library because, stupid me, it was rated highly on GR (you people have GOT to stop letting me down), I thought, Oh I'm gonna like this. It opened with a dishy, catty blog post ala Gossip Girl (I could almost hear Kirsten Bell) that doled out all kinds of scoop on a bunch of rich, bored high schoolers - as a high school teacher, I am a shameless sucker for this stuff. Well, sadly, those intermittent blog posts were actually not only the best but in fact the only good writing in this whole novel. Told in alternating view points and media (text, mom, daughter, random emails), we are told (and this is a big issue that I will get to soon) that Amelia, a beautifulsmartpopularhonorsstudentwitheverythinggoingforher, has not only been accused of cheating (but Amelia would never! She is too this that the other)but, once her smartprettysuceessfulofcoursepartnerinalawfirmbutstilldevotedmom comes rushing to her side despite having been in a Very Important Meeting, Kate the mom discovers that her daughter not only surprised her mom by cheating, but also by then flinging herself off the roof and killing herself.If this all sounds rather far fetched, don't worry! Kate thinks so, too, and she KNOWS her daughter, I mean, yes, she is always working and never home, but SHE MAKES TIME such as Friday night dinners out and Saturday brunch in and Sunday movies. We are, in fact, told over and over how swell Kate is and how amazing Amelia is, yet, funnily enough, the entire novel is then dedicated to MUCHOS drama that Amelia was in over her pretty smart popular head in, with Mom (who Amelia LOVES don't get me wrong) having no clue. The other interesting thing is that prettysmartpopular Amelia who is OBSESSED with reading the densest classics EVER speaks like a total moron and is a martyr to her unredeemingly obnoxious selfish best friend, who, while walking all over Amelia, inspires pretty much nothing but guilt from the smart pretty popular girl for not being ENOUGH of a friend.Anyway. Over the top dedicated despite her job Kate is shocked by the suicide (and I guess that makes sense, since, well, getting caught for cheating can evoke all kinds of responses but flinging your fifteen year old self off a roof is a rather creative one - nice job, there, McCreight) and then all the more shocked when she receives a text that - get this - Amelia didn't jump! NO! But wait! that highly unlikely and ill conceived plot actually pales in comparison to the crazy twists the book then takes.We go back in time through Amelia's simpering and moronic prose and we discover the following:Her rude and obnoxious and self centered BFF (who has been scripted by someone who either never met a teenager or only met ones via sitcoms for the girl speaks only in, like, super annoying acronyms which is SO like WTF and never ONCE did I, like, LOL or feel like this was, like, SO IT but rather, um, offensive to teens everywhere) has fallen totally in love with Ian who, because the author decided to make British, does not say ONE SINGLE SENTENCE without 'bloody' 'mate' 'knickers' or some other means to prove to me that, yes, yes he really IS bloody British! However Ian proves to be a rather confusing and unnecessary and ultimately annoying character.Amelia, despite being a nerd and, frankly, charmless, has been tapped by the Magpies, a vicious group of nasty girls who are apparently totally secret yet have their pics online, have huge raging parties, and several other holes in the story that are too numerous to mention. Despite Amelia being, in her nerdiness, way too cool or smart to want in on the nastiness, and despite having sworn to obnoxious BFF who would like, kill Amelia if she joined without her (or herself since, we later and at a convenient time, learn back door like that BFF has a nasty habit of cutting herself), yea so despite all that she decides she does want in, and, though we are told every annoying detail of every character and their thoughts in painstakingly detailed told not shown fashion, we actually are not at all privy to when it is, exactly, Amelia decides, you know, she's gay, and also decides to fall in love with the conveniently ambiguously named Dylan (so as to mask this from her mom's reconstructing - clever move, there)who has even less charm than the BFF and basically just moons around all day being dumb and is actually really mean to Amelia, but we just go with it, I guess, because Dylan is so awesome (???) and also beautiful (ah, ok).Anyway, we learn that Amelia also has picked up a cyber stalker named Ben who, despite being rather creepy and weird, has also managed to make Amelia rather happy even though he strikes me as rather curt and strange.We also learn that Kate has some big secret as to who Amelia's father is, and that Amelia is being harassed because of it.You know what? There are like a million more folds in this story but I feel like I don't even have the heart to type them all out. Let's just say that the formula seems to be Gossip Girl plus every far fetched law feuled overly exaggerated soap opera plot possible, where grown ups act like children and children sometimes act like grown ups or like villains, and the story just becomes a mockery of itself the deeper it goes.But my main gripe, really, was the writing. It got to the point where so much backstory was referenced that I kept checking to see if this was a sequel and I was just being fed information that really, I was supposed to already know. The characters were acting out the roles picked out for them - and not very well, I might add - and the nagging apologetic voice of the author was loud and distracting the. Entire. Time. Kate is this! But also this! But please don't think she's that, she's not, no, not ever. And on and on and on. It was as if the characters couldn't be trusted to just BE.Gillian Flynn, teenagers, Brits, and (I forgot!) IT guys (who are always high, apparently, and speak exclusively in surfing lingo) - be offended. And writers, and readers, and puppet masters who manage - somehow - to let the puppets tell the story and for the strings to remain - as they should be - invisible."

        "user_review": "\"The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.\"- Virginia WoolfThis book made me cry. And I really wasn't expecting that.I think the comparisons betweenReconstructing AmeliaandGone Girlhave done this book a disservice. I know that every mystery/thriller with some unconventional female antics is now compared toGone Girl- inevitable, really, in a world so focused on the marketing and selling aspect.ButGone Girl(and the books that deserve to be grouped with it) left me shocked and intrigued at the dark psychological exploration of what people are capable of. I finish them thinking they are clever, twisted and totally disturbing. They do not make me cry. They do not break my heart like this book did.I can see why the marketing department at HarperCollins readReconstructing Ameliaand saw an opportunity to market it as the dark, twisty thriller of theGone Girlvariety. Itisabout the secrets we all keep and hide from those closest to us. It's about discovering that the people we love most aren't all we believed them to be.And it looks closely at some of the most evil, depressed and fucked up creatures in the world: teenage girls.BUT. There is one reason this book is so good and it's not some huge, mind-boggling, never-saw-that-coming twist... it's the relationship between Kate and Amelia. Kate is a lawyer from a \"serious\" family that never showed her any affection. After discovering her ability to fall for and/or sleep with all the wrong guys, she became pregnant with Amelia. Though her mother wanted her to have an abortion, Kate finally saw an opportunity to shower another human being with all the love and affection that lay unused inside her.Despite having to work the long hours of a lawyer, Kate adored her daughter and dedicated every spare minute to her. She was open with her, encouraged Amelia to talk to her about anything, and loved her so unconditionally. And the reader knows that. I could feel Kate's love for Amelia. I mourned Amelia too because Kate did.How do you deal with the death of your child? How do you deal with the death of the person your entire life revolved around?And, more than that, Kate cannot come to terms with Amelia's supposed suicide. It's hard enough that her daughter is dead, but she has to also accept that Amelia did it to herself. Because... Kate wasn't there enough? She didn't see the signs? She wasn't a good enough mother? So when an anonymous text informs Kate that Amelia didn't jump, she desperately grasps at this possibility.Finding new information that reopens the case, Kate sparks an investigation deep into the world of private school teenage girls and all the dark horrors that lie inside their minds. Told in alternating perspectives - of Kate in the present and Amelia in the weeks leading up to her death -the mystery unravels to reveal ever more mysteries.It shouldn't be grouped withGone Girl, though, because it is not that kind of book. It's about a mother, a daughter, the love between them, and the mistakes we all make - teenagers and adults alike.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr"

        "user_review": "I wanted to like this, but the writing is really bad. Really bad. Really, really, really bad. Plus, some of the plot points simply made no sense. There are certain things you can suspend your disbelief to and that's fine and normal when it comes to any form of fiction, as long as it makes sense in their world the author created, but there is a limit. There's no way a detective would bring the mother of a victim along with him to interview witnesses and get statements. It….. No, just no.Unless, he wasn't really a detective and was only hired to act like one so Kate could find the truth. If this was the case, then I'm fine with it. However, that doesn't happen. He's just a cop who is investigating the suspicious death of a girl and decides that it would be fun to let the dead girl's mom take lead in the investigation.Yea...that would never happen. Never.Also, the adults sounded and acted like teenagers. Once you get to the end, you'll understand what I mean. The whole thing was just ridiculous.Great potential here, but it's wasted by bad writing, a plot that falls short, and characters that are just too stupid and not believable.I'm seriously disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book and it just fell flat. I could probably write more about how the relationship between Kate and Amelia was mostly showing not telling and despite making it seem like the two were super close, they felt really distant from one another. Or I could write about how the whole Ben subplot was creepy and awkward. Or I could even talk about the Magpies, whose secret circle isn't really all that secret. Or even about how everyone magically reveals their secrets within the last few pages, wrapping up all of the loose ends in a convenient little bow.But I won't.Because the main problem with this novel isn't really the plot, or the lack of brains the characters seem to have, it's the writing. I almost feel like with a better author the stupid plot points maybe would have become plot perks or something. Instead, the book is just lackluster and boring. And a novel with this much potential and this kind of plot shouldn't be boring.Overall: I know there are a lot of people who loved this. Loved it to the point that it's going to be a movie starring Nicole Kidman. But I didn't like it. It was boring. It was unbelievable. And I just didn't enjoy reading this. This is McCreight's debut novel and she did have great ideas, so I'll probably pick up her next book to see what she'll come up with next. But yea, this book was bad."

        "user_review": "In a nutshell this book is what I said it would be - a Lifetime movie meets Gossip Girl mixed with The Skulls & a dash of Law&Order: SVU for, an attempt at, good measure. If that is your sort of thing then enjoy but if you are looking for imagination, colorful writing, complex characters & a story that doesn't have plot holes then I suggest you pass on this book. EW review gave this an 'A' calling it \"this year's Gone Girl — you remember Gillian Flynn's best-selling nail-biter of 2012\" WRONG! That book was genius - twisted and haunted you long after that last page. It's laughable to put these two books side by side. Reconstructing Amelia - I could go on but it's not even worth it. WACKNESS!"

        "user_review": "Good lord this book is awful. It reads like a novelization of a particularly insipid Lifetime movie. I can't even fathom how this dreck got published.This book is a disaster in all respects. The characters are paper thin and uniformly obnoxious. They are each imbued with exactly one personality trait that is hammered into the ground (\"mom works!\" \"Daughter reads\" \"boy crazy best friend\"). The characters have no interior lives. None of these characters feel like people. They are some of the most underdeveloped characters I have ever read: to call them cardboard would be an insult to cardboard.This author's prose is also terrible. She has no flare with language at all. She eschews descriptive language of any kind, and her writing style (sentence structure and vocabulary) are grossly simplistic. A brain damaged seven year old could turn a better phrase than this author. Her dialogue is similarly tin eared.The plot is alternately super predictable and laughably contrived. There is no dramatic tension, only a maddening desire for the book to end.I am no book snob. I don't need literary greatness. I would have been plenty happy with this book if it was merely entertaining. Instead it is only highly irritating."

        "user_review": "Sometimes it's hard to tell how fast the current's moving until you're headed over a waterfall.On one level,Reconstructing Ameliais a mystery. Everyone—even her heartbroken mother Kate—believes the party line story that fifteen-year-old Amelia Baron jumped to her death from the roof of her elite private school after getting caught cheating on an assignment. But when Kate gets an anonymous text a few weeks later reading \"She didn't jump,\" Kate convinces a police detective to reopen the investigation.Reconstructing Ameliadoes answer that mystery in the final pages, but it is secondary to the larger story of these high school children and their parents. Even Kate observes late in the novel that what drove Amelia up to the roof that day was ultimately more important than whether her death was suicide, an accident of some king, or a deliberate act. And what drove her up there was a tragic combination of secrets, peer pressure, first love, cat fishing, bullying, and good old teen angst.Reconstructing Ameliahas an interesting structure, shifting not only narrative perspectives between Kate and Amelia but also shifting between different periods of time. It took a while to get used to it, but I liked how you would see a scene from one perspective and understand it one way, and then re-experience the same scene later from the other perspective with a much greater understanding of what was happening. However, the idea that the detective would keep permitting Kate to accompany him on his interviews got less and less believable as the book went along.Reconstructing Ameliais not a happy story. Every page is haunted either by the death that has occurred or by the death that's approaching. Every person in Amelia's life played a role—some much larger than others—in her death. In the end, there was a realThirteen Reasons Whyvibe to this book, especially watching adult after adult fail this girl despite every sign that she needs their help. Still, it's a good story, full of twists and several reveals that tie everything together. Recommended.Buddy read withKathy."

        "user_review": "A glowing review in Entertainment Weekly suggested this book is the must-read thriller of 2013, the next Gone Girl. Based on that review, and bored by the last book I finished, I was eager to read this one. But the glowing review left me disappointed. Don't get me wrong - this is a fun, engaging thriller that kept me reading. I finished it in about a day and a half. But I would hardly rave about it.Kate, a single mother in her late 30s, is a junior partner in a large NY law firm, logging in the hours and missing her teenaged daughter, Amelia. Her world is shattered when Amelia throws herself off the roof of her school after Amelia is caught plagiarizing a paper. Or did Amelia kill herself? Kate has her doubts, which multiply after she receives a mysterious, anonymous text.Told in the present (from Kate's perspective) interspersed with the past (from Amelia's perspective in the weeks leading up to her death, as well as through texts and Facebook status updates), the book kept me reading. Some of the twists were predictable, and others were not, and I was entertained throughout."

        "user_review": "The premise behind this book was intriguing but I find myself deeply unsatisfied by the end. The format itself was interesting by showing so many different mediums, though at times confusing.Throughout the book, I was interested to know the truth about what happened to Amelia. Did she commit suicide or was it foul play? Were the Magpies involved? Who was really her father? Who is Ben? But in the end I found so many or the answers disappointing that it made the journey feel like a waste as well.On top of that there were several things that I found absolutely ridiculous about this plot:1. What cop in their right mind would allow a mother of the victim to be so involved with the investigation? Even leading the investigation at times. I'm guessing this was a literary mechanism to allow for information of the investigation to be explained by Kate and with her point of view. But really? Couldn't the author just have added parts with the detective's point of view? Absolutely ludicrous. I know this isn't law and order, but come on!2. Kate is super surprised to find out that Jeremy is the father of Amelia because they only had sex one time. Really? Does getting pregnant now require multiple occasions of sexual intercourse? How naive can she be? If you're having sex with multiple people and you happen to get pregnant, perhaps you shouldn't just assume the father of your child is the one that you had sex with the most. Some lawyer she is - can't even use any logical theory.My point..and I do have one. This book could have been brilliant, but there were far too many missed opportunities that just didn't pan out. Not too much the hard to miss typos. But I suppose I should blame the editor for that one."

        "user_review": "I am very confused and i do not know how to review this book, surely it was a reading that I devoured in a few days and that really it hooked me a lot..At the same time, it all seemed to me too much exaggerated and in some cases even grotesque...I immediately say that Amelia seemed to me (sorry I know, she was 15 years old,) a poor fool for how she is described by the author....It was not a character that involved me emotionally and I certainly had no desire to cheer for her, and no way to be worried about her becoming...The setting in the private and expensive high school was embarrassing, I don't know maybe i am european and i can not understand certain dynamics of sororities or school groups, they never existed in our high school system, really... it leaves me amazed by this concentration of collective depravation of these young people, there will be millions of them here too,i know, I don't doubt.... but the story, as it was told, was just a neverending loss of credibility ...Good and adequate mistery and suspence, but too artificial and not well built in the narration.The question of partners, illegitimate children, betrayals are the most tacky aspect of all! Let's face it, it held little on everything else...Too bad because the initial idea presented in the book was not bad at all....Sono molto confusa e non so bene come recensire questo libro, sicuramente è stata una lettura che ho divorato in pochi giorni e che mi ha veramente preso molto...allo stesso tempo però, mi sembrava tutto veramente troppo esagerato e in alcuni casi persino grottesco....Dico subito che Amelia mi è sembrata da subito,(scusatemi lo so, aveva 15 anni,) una povera fessa per come viene descritta dall' autrice....Per me non è stato certo un personaggio che mi abbia coinvolto emotivamente e non ho certo avuto desiderio di tifare per lei, figuriamoci preoccupazione per il suo divenire...L' ambientazione nella High school privata di alto livello era imbarazzante, non so forse noi siamo europei e certe dinamiche di fraternità o gruppi scolastici non riusciamo a capirli essendo estranei al nostro mondo scolastico, veramente.... mi lascia basita questo concentrato di depravazione collettiva di questi giovani, ce ne saranno a milioni anche qui, non metto in dubbio..... ma la storia, man mano che veniva raccontata, perdeva colpi di credibilità a non finire....Sicuramente suspence adeguata, ma troppo artificiosa e non ben congeniata.La questione dei partner, figli, tradimenti etcc è l'aspetto piu' pacchiano di tutto! diciamolo, reggeva poco su tutto il resto...Peccato perchè l'idea iniziale presentata nel libro non era male per niente...."

        "user_review": "Reconstructing Amelia by Kimberly McCreight is one of those books that parents of teenagers will read and think, could this possibly be happening in my child's life or is it all just hype.\"Do you really know whats going on inside your daughter's head\"What a brilliant premise for a novel. We have become so advanced in social media and yet so naive to the dangers and consequences of the advancements. Once there was a time when bullying at school might have been confined to the school yard or the playground but now with social media the bully has access to the victim on a 24/7 basis. That's a scary thought......I enjoyed the plot for this novel as it is thought provoking with plenty of drama and the sort of book that should create quite a good group discussion in a book club.I did however find elements of the story quite unrelalistic especially whenKate tags along with the leutienent when he conducts his investigations , this just wouldn't have happened. Also Kate's mothers reactions after her grand-daughter's death just didn't work for me.This type of inconsistencies in a novel tend to bug me and I just cant let go.This was a book club read and I liked it and will look forward to discussing it with friends."

        "user_review": "This book was one of the biggest disappointments I've read in a long time. I like mysteries, I like books about teenagers, I like books that incorporate different kinds of media (e-mails, texts, blog posts, etc.), and I think the book had a good premise: a seemingly-happy fifteen year old girl flings herself off the roof of her fancy, private school, and her mother is determined to figure out why. But it all goes downhill from there.Amelia is the cliche of the Perfect High School Daughter: she is a star athlete, a straight-A student who would NEVER do anything to seriously disrespect her mother or her crazy best friend or step out of line in any way. Amelia is bland and flat, simply too good for anyone to relate to. She's so innocent in everything she does, so earnestly good but completely naive. She has literally no obvious flaws, except being \"too nice\" and letting herself get walked all over. Who wants to read a story about a perfect person? Her mother, Kate, is similarly cliched. She is a high-powered New York lawyer who works crazy hours but remains consistently devoted to her teenaged daughter. She'll drop everything at her very important meeting to go get her daughter, even though she'll internally monologue about how stressful it is for three or four paragraphs first. Their relationships is too forced in a Gilmore Girls kind of way...Amelia says things like, \"don't get me wrong I LOVED my mother, even if she was never around\", and Kate talks about how she and Amelia had different special bonding activities every Friday, Saturday and Sunday that neither of them \"would EVER cancel on\". They're too-perfect characters who have to keep reminding us how perfect they both are.The plot, which had so much potential, is kind of a mess. There are so many useless characters that serve little to no purpose. The plot isn't intricate enough to require detailed descriptions of Kate's secretary, all of Amelia's fellow classmates, the guidance counselor who doesn't end up helping at all. We learn the names of so, so many characters and then almost all of them are completely irrelevant to the plot. There's a subplot of Kate coming to terms with her own parents that never pans out, and email exchanges with a guy who teaches English in Ghana that is not even close to relevant by the longest stretch. Why is this book, only four hundred pages, packed with so many irrelevant details and people that end up being utterly pointless?The most interesting story is the one that's cut off by Amelia's death: meek, perfect Amelia is tapped by the Magpies, a not-so-secret club of girls who, as far as the reader can tell, basically just throw parties and talk about how secret their club is. She finds herself really attracted to one of the other girls in the club, and decides to stick with it for a chance to get closer to her, even though the girl that Amelia likes is devoid of any real personality except being \"crazy beautiful\" and kind of spacey. But the club predictably turns on Amelia and turns her life into the specific kind of living hell only teenagers can inflict on one another. THIS is the meat of the story: Amelia coming to terms with her sexuality, being used by a girl she thinks she's in love with, and attempting to hold everything together as the other girls try to rip her apart. Amelia's death is not a catalyst for the story, but a quick ending to the only interesting plot line. This book had the potential to be one of the few really good books about teenage girls coming out and dealing with bullying, but it opted for cheap maybe-murder mystery instead.I listened to the audio version of this book, and I will say that Khristine Hvam did a good job with the narration. She created a lovely voice for Amelia, even though her Brooklyn police officer accent should maybe be retired.I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It is deeply unsatisfying in both plot and writing, and I expected so much more from such an interesting idea."

        "user_review": "Initial reaction:I was really surprised how engaged I was throughout this entire narrative. The book somehow missed my radar when it was first released, but I got it on Google Play for $1.99 during one of their sales. I couldn't put this down at all. I loved the format, loved the way it kept me guessing, and the characters were well constructed. I still need to collect my thoughts, but this is looking like a 4 star read.Full review:Edit 1/28/2016: Character name corrected to Kate. Apologies for the confusion!Confession time: \"Reconstructing Amelia\" is the kind of mystery that I really love reading, and it's no surprise to me that I really enjoyed the ride this book took me on. It had a boatload of twists I wasn't expecting, tragic coincidences, and characters I could very well see the motivations and reactions for throughout the narrative.This narrative trades between the story of the mother, Kate, and Amelia, her 15-year old daughter. Kate is a hard working lawyer that tries to do well by Amelia despite some secrets in the past she would rather not deal with if she can help it. But Amelia starts acting in erratic ways that reach a point of no return as Kate's called by Amelia's school to learn that her daughter's been suspended. Next thing you know, Amelia's dead of an apparent suicide.Kate feels the enormous weight of guilt for a number of reasons (questioning her parenting, not recognizing the signs in the days before Amelia's death, not getting to the school on time, etc.). But one text throws everything into focus for Kate - one sent anonymously to her phone:\"She didn't jump.\"Kate begins the quest to figure out what happened to her only daughter, and reveals a twisted web of cover-ups, lies, complicated romances and relationships, jealousy, bullying, among other things. Technically, I ended up reading this novel twice because I read my Google Play version and then downloaded the audiobook from my library (which was exceptionally read by one of my favorite narrators: Khristine Hvam). Kate and Amelia both were relatable characters, and I found myself following the timeline and portrayals well even as the book moved from past to present and featured trades between texts (which if you're thrown out of the narrative in the print, the audiobook does a good job of presenting those in an alternative way) and perspective points.Definitely would recommend this read, and I'd gladly read it again for the experience.Overall score: 4/5 stars."

        "user_review": "Time to deconstruct Reconstructing Amelia. I think I must have enjoyed this book. After all, I never considered not finishing it. So it kept me engaged. I had no problems switching from Amelia to Kate and back to Amelia. And I had no problems reading current time and 1997. I wanted to know the whole backstory.This was not, however, a perfect book. I really objected to how Lew the Lieutenant let Kate get so deeply involved in the investigation. She was the one poring over what was on Amelia's phone and computer, and questioning witnesses. That was bad enough, but not once did she do as she was told. \"Go home\" but she didn't. \"Let me do the talking\" but she didn't. \"Wait for me\" but she didn't. At times I could feel Kate's grief, but then I'd think she was jumping to conclusions and raging for no reason.As for Amelia, I felt sorry for her. She spent way too much time alone, had very little guidance from Kate, and seemed smart enough to know she should turn to an adult when things got way out of her control.Some reviewers felt this was a story about bullying, but I didn't. Amelia wanted to be accepted and she was so lonely that she accepted the invitation from The Magpies. It was only when she wanted out that she was pressured.The Magpies were snobs, and so were some of their mothers, and so were some of the teachers and administrators at the school. Even the first cop, Molina, was a terrible guy. I really found not one single character that I related to.So, I got the backstory. I learned who was who and what had happened, although some of it seemed unlikely. I doubt I'd recommend this book because it was just okay."

        "user_review": "Reconstructing Amelia is a debut novel by Kimberly McCreight, and, my gosh, is it good. In the beginning of the novel readers meet Kate, a single mother and successful lawyer who struggles daily with determining which role is more important. Her daughter, Amelia, is a bright, creative, thoughtful and focused high school student. Despite Kate's \"crushing work hours, she knew her daughter. Really knew her,\" she assures herself. But the closeness of their bond is called to question when Kate receives a phone call... Amelia has been suspended for cheating. Upon reaching the school, Kate discovers that the severity of the situation has escalated: Amelia has jumped to her death from the school's roof. Blinded by grief, Kate accepts Amelia's apparent suicide as truth until one afternoon when she receives a chilling, anonymous text message: \"She didn't jump…\".Intrigued? I was too. And from the first chapter on until the final chapter, I could not put this book down. The gripping storyline follows Kate as she tries to uncover the truth behind her daughter's death, leading the reader through the lives (and lies) of students, parents, teachers and employees. No one knows the truth, and everyone has something to hide.Read Kaitlyn's full review on The Savvy Reader, here:http://thesavvyreader.ca/2013/reconst..."

        "user_review": "2.5 starsI could really tear this book a new one if I wanted to, seeing as how it is plagued by incredulous plot twists and nonsensical melodramatic character motivations that at times positivelyscreamdaytime soap opera antics.Despite these maddening shortcomings, I was able to overlook most of them most of the time as the novel fairly hums along with just enough speed and tension to keep you turning the pages. It's a beach read in the sense that if you are sun stoned and feeling epically lazy, this one has just enough salacious bite to keep you conscious and wondering just what the hell did happen to Amelia that day on the roof: did she jump? or was she pushed?I liked how the author uses various bits of social media (texts, Facebook, emails, etc) to \"reconstruct\" a young woman's life and state of mind proving how much can be found there and yet how inadequate all that \"sharing\" can turn out to be when your goal is to really understand someone. But in the end, it just felt hollow and gimmicky anyway.I was just expecting so much more here with such a fantastic premise fueling its engine. In the hands ofGillian FlynnandMegan Abbott, I'm certain I would have gotten exactly what I was looking for. Not here though. Not this time.One thing that really bugged me:when Amelia's case is reopened, why would Kate as her mother be allowed to become so involved in the investigation -- going on interview calls and asking questions. It seems to me, it would have been her job to sit tight and wait to hear the results, not chase them down side by side with the Detective assigned to the case. That took me out of the story every time. If Kate had hired a PI, and was going about this on her own without police involvement, that would have made sense. But to be working with the police and be so immediately included in the investigation in this way drove me mental. Because that would never happen. Especially once foul play was suspected."

It was only the conclusion of the book that ended up ruining the story for me.I think McCreight did an amazing job with this novel, making sure all the details match up and leaving no unanswered questions."

        "user_review": "\"Sometimes its hard to tell how fast the current's moving until you're headed over a waterfall\"Kimberly McCreight-Reconstructing AmeliaHaha. I looked at some of my Goodreads friends reviews and most rated this book highly. I myself was crazy about it . And why not? This is a GREAT READ!When I first read this I wrote I think this maybe the best book on bullying I have ever read. I still think it is up there, along with Weightless and Love Heather. The author really gets inside the head of high school kids. I was blown away.Reading books on bullying can be tragic because many of them do not end well and this book is as tragic as any book you will read on the subject.It is also a mystery and jumps back and forth in time. The actual bullying itself is not light reading and maybe triggering to those that have a difficult time with the subject matter.For me, the only book on bullying I have read that is at this level is \"Love, Heather\". Weightless is a great read as well. I read \"Weightless\" after I read Reconstructing Amelia and though I rated both a five and think both are exceptional, I liked this book a bit better. It reached my inner core and touched me to the point I was in tears and when a book can do that..it gets a five.Amelia narrates for some of the book and it is so heartbreaking because the reader forms an attachment to her. Amelia is someone anybody on GR would want to know. She is smart and curious and just a wonderful character. But it is heartbreaking because you are reading about this beautiful and bright girl with so much potential but you already know how it is going to end. So it's visceral and tragic.I have discussed this book at length with many people I know and have not yet one person who did not like it. I do not know if this is a film or not but it should be. I had heard whispers that it was being made into a movie but do not know if that ever happened.And with all the real life cases of bullying going on maybe this should be required reading in school.I have no idea if it would change anything but books like this..they teach some important life lessons.Highly recommended. Excellent."

        "user_review": "2.5 out of 5, rounded up to 3.This was not my favorite book. But that's not the book's fault. I'm just not a fan of contemporary murder mysteries unless they're penned by Nora Roberts, my favorite guilty-pleasure author. I would have never picked this book up on my own, but joining a real-life book club has gotten me out of my fantasy comfort zone. All of that being said, the hatred I had for the first half of the book mellowed, and I sped through the last half.I think one of my big problems with contemporary thrillers is that their plot twists are over-hyped. Going into a book like this orGone GirlorThe Girl on the Train, I psych myself up to be shocked. But then I'm not. Sure, there are some surprises, but I end up predicting many of the twists. Perhaps this is from overexposure, but the books lose a bit of their zing for me, regardless. Also, contemporary thrillers tend to have an overabundance of unlikeable characters, and this book was no exception. I understand that the writers are going for realism here, but their view on reality is depressingly pessimistic in my opinion. When characters have no redeeming qualities, I have a hard time connecting to them and caring about their stories.Once I passed the halfway point in the story, I did start to care a bit more about Amelia and Karen, but I was never quite able to cement a connection with them. And, unfortunately, none of the \"big reveals\" in the plot were surprising to me, but I won't get into those as I'm trying for a spoiler-free review. But I did enjoy this one more than both of the aforementioned books, though I ratedGone Girlhigher because I had read less of this genre at that time and was thus more surprised by the twists. All in all, it was a decent read, and would probably appeal more to a reader who doesn't prefer their stories filled with dragons and magic and sassy talking swords."

        "user_review": "Interesting idea, although I'm not entirely convinced of it.This book could be shorter. Only the second half gained some pace. And I found this part really interesting, but the first half was a bit long for me. I wasn't immediately interested in what happened to Amelia. I needed a lot of time for this and I think this book really needed a lot of pages to do it.I don't like when a story is told from several perspectives. In some exceptional cases, it does not bother me. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I believe that this story would be even better and more mysterious if Amelia's point of view was ignored entirely, or at least greatly reduced. In my opinion, the story would be a lot more dramatic if Kate was discovering all these details about her daughter's life. Unfortunately, I was not as interested in Amelia's POV chapters as Kate's current discoveries. Texts and Facebook entries would be enough, I didn't need all these chapters. I understand their goal was to build Amelia's character, but I'm not sure there was a place for that in this book.With all the emotional buildup, Kate's character looks a bit flat for me. It lacks depth, I have trouble describing her personality. What defines her is love for her daughter, but other than that, I can't say much about her. To some extent, this also applies to Amelia. I've spent almost half a book with each of them, and it's still hard for me to really describe them apart from some generalities.But overall it was a good book, especially in the second half when there were twists and turns. I did not expect an end, or in fact an explanation, why the girls at school harassed her so much."

        "user_review": "So a few weeks ago I was reading reviews here and I can't recall the book but someone pointed out that a problem they have with books that deal with girls coming into their sexuality or falling in love for the first time is this slightly absurd idea that they have no idea what's going on. There's a lot of \"what are these strange feelings I am suddenly having that I have never before even heard about?\" and \"I am completely unfamiliar with this strange tingling between my legs that has never been mentioned in any of the social media outlets I frequent or books/television/movies I watch daily!?\"Its a very valid point and unfortunately it was really stuck in my head while I was reading Kimberly McCreight's well written but somehow rudimentary seeming \"Reconstructing Amelia.\"There's a huge amount of retreading very familiar territory here and that's not always a bad thing if you have something new to say. Alas this ends up being a fairly typical absentee mom didn't really \"know\" her daughter until it was too late followed by a giant mess of cliched plot devices and stock thriller characters with so many psychological problems between them its hard to imagine how they all function daily in society.Without giving away too much, because despite my misgivings I wouldn't say DON'T read this just don't go in thinking its the next \"Gone Girl\" like the book jacket reviews claim, you the reader will be given some GIANT clues about what Amelia's \"secrets\" are within like the first four pages, they will seem really obvious because they are and then you still have another 250+ pages to go until her mom figures it all out. And, as mentioned above, it was very, very hard for me to accept that Amelia herself, a child of the new millenium who lives in frickin' NYC doesn't know whats going on and doesn't have a SINGLE person she feels she can talk to.There was just too much suspension of disbelief required here for my comfort level. I can deal with the hackneyed \"teenagers are so cruel to each other\" plot lines up to a point until it just becomes absurd and there's a random story line involving Amelia's secret text exchanges with the mysterious \"Ben\" who turns out to be someone so utterly ridiculous that when his identity is finally revealed its so bizarre it feels as though McCreight suddenly remembered she had to have him be SOMEBODY and just pulled a name out of hat.I think there's just too much going on here. There's a massive conspiracy covering up Amelia's death on multiple levels and so many people are involved for so many crazy reasons that eventually NOTHING rings true.My biggest problem though, and this is an issue I have with a lot of writers these days, is McCreight's tendency to pull her punches.Yes, Amelia's mom works too much and could be around more, but rather then make that an actual issue or a real character flaw on her part McCreight actually goes to great links to continually remind the reader what a great mom she actually is. She and Amelia are always going out and doing wonderful bonding things in the city and in her flashback chapters Amelia herself mentions wishing her mom was around more but also constantly waxes poetic about how she KNOWS how much she loves her, she REALLY, REALLY knows!!!Even the resolution of Amelia's death is half hearted. I would have preferred an open ended, what really happened sort of thing to the direction it actually goes. Its one of those non-endings that leaves everyone innocent or at least sympathetic enough to sort of force the reader not to be too angry at anyone.This was an empty read which is almost worse than a bad read."

I certainly hope so.No complaints here, a gripping and powerful novel... one of the best I've read this year so far.Emily says it all here better than I can:Emily's reviewI would recommend it, just carve out some time for is all :) Happy reading!Would I read it again?

        "user_review": "I guess we have to thank Gillian Flynn for making the literary thriller one of the hot new genres...after I finished reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking about how much this book would appeal to fans of Gone Girl. It's not QUITE as twisted and dark as Gillian Flynn's novels, but the elements are definitely present, and this is a powerful read.The story begins with Kate Baron, a single mother and attorney, receiving a call from her daughter Amelia's exclusive private school, saying that Amelia had plagiarized her latest English essay. Kate can't believe that her intelligent daughter would have done something like this, so she heads to the school to sort everything out. By the time she gets there, however, she finds that Amelia has fallen to her death from the school roof in an apparent act of suicide.Several months after Amelia's death, Kate receives a text message saying \"Amelia didn't jump,\" confirming what she already knew in her heart - that Amelia didn't commit suicide. As Kate begins her own investigation into Amelia's death, she realizes just how many secrets her daughter had, and how she barely knew her daughter at all. This is a thrilling and intense mystery, but it's also a poignant story of high school hazing, love, sexuality, and friendship.One of this book's biggest accomplishments is how well the author was able to recreate the teenage experience. The story may take place at a privileged high school, but the uncertainty, fear, and frustration are definitively universal for anyone who went to an American high school. It certainly brought back powerful memories for me, although I actually haven't been out of high school long enough to realistically forget much. The inclusion of the text messages & Facebook posts also go a long way towards making this feel contemporary and realistic, but never dumbed down. That in itself is a huge accomplishment.The structure of the story is interesting, as it cuts back and forth between flashbacks and the present day, and includes excerpts from text messages, Facebook statuses, and a mysterious gossip-based blog centered around the high school. As a result, the reader is put in Kate's position by having to piece together the mystery using small scraps of information. This makes the book incredibly fast-paced and readable...I finished this one approximately 24 hours after I first started reading. This is a page-turner of the highest order.As I mentioned before, this comparison to Gillian Flynn should be taken with a tiny grain of salt, as Reconstructing Amelia never quite reaches the levels of shock and revulsion that Gone Girl or Sharp Objects seem to manage. But this isn't a downside of the book, just a comment on how the story itself is a bit different. However, there are still plenty of unlikeable characters worthy of the reader's intense dislike, and this portrait of the confused and manipulated high school student is extremely powerful.Recommended for: fans of Gillian Flynn, teenagers looking for relatable yet more mature reading material, and readers looking for a thrilling novel more complex than the average bestselling thriller.Readalikes: Okay, Gillian Flynn's the obvious go-to author. If you enjoy well-crafted, dark mysteries and unlikeable characters, you can't go wrong with any of her three novels. Gone Girl is the most popular (and the most recent), but Sharp Objects and Dark Places are exceptional as well.In the Woods by Tana French. This is definitely much more of a straight-up mystery, but it's exceptionally dark, creates both likeable and unlikeable characters, and reveals bits and pieces of the mystery through flashbacks interspersed in the main narrative. Plus, In the Woods is written with a definite literary style in mind, and the psychological profiles of the characters are remarkably astute.Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult. This book places less emphasis on the darkness of human nature than it does on the moral and ethical issues surrounding school violence, but it accurately portrays the life of a downtrodden and manipulated high school student, pieces together the characters' mysterious backstory through flashbacks, and keeps the reader turning pages well into the night."

His advice \"keep writing, and start performing. It's gonna be total shit the first few times, but it gets better. And that's the only way to get better\" set me on a path that has shaped me and how I try to look at the world.I started performing, and immediately bought this book when it went on sale. I have not been disappointed for a moment since. He speaks with a truth, a pain, and a humor that sticks to you like wax, and only after letting the oil in your heart burn can you peel some of his words away from your skin. Our Numbered Days is unpretentious and brilliantly real. If you don't feel something after reading it, I'm not sure you had the ability to feel in the first place.Favorite Poems: Ballad of the Bruised Lung, Bystander Paralysis, Chitin, Our Numbered Days #4 #7, OCD, Liminality8/6/19: I've revisited this old friend, and had to fight off silverfish to read it.

Some slam poets cannot work written out and I think Neil is one of them. The casual language just felt childish and amateurish when reading it on a page. There were also very harmful viewpoints on relationships, women, and masculinity in here. It all just felt very recycled, the \"poem\" that went \"I am concerned that if I take medication I will no longer be able to write poems\" was the dumbest thing I have ever read. That's not a poem. That's simply a thought that literally every creative type with mental health issues has thought. Like I legit wrote that in my teenage diary. Sorry not sorry, I got some feelings about this."

I'm super glad it did not disappoint.I feel like poets are the real magicians. It's like they take words; words that we know and arrange them in a beautiful way that it hits you and makes you feel connected. There is no word besides magical to describe this.It made me feel lonely.

Right up there with the likes of Yrsa Daly-Ward's Bone and Nayyirah Waheed's Salt, Our Numbered Days is a volume of integrity and vulnerability. Fresh, firm, and lucid, the poems are stripped bare of superficiality and served up instead, is a mean meal of honest, pithy writing.You will come looking for a gift of words and find yourself a lexicon of the emotional Self. Utterly satisfying, belly-full with goodness. This book is nourishment."

He has extremely powerful work and in the past few years he managed to move me with it in many ways. That being said, I don't think this collection reflects his talent at all. Some of my favorite pieces, and what I'd like to call his best work, weren't in here. The poems that were here, tho, were a bit nonsensical and not hard hitting or poetic enough for my taste.Having read this, I do think his poetry works much better when you hear it spoken out loud and from now on I suppose that will be my medium of taking his stuff in.The two poems from here I really liked were Future Tense and OCD and I would highly recommend you to chekc them out."

Sure, they're popular and that popularity has translated into some success. But to say you're going 'on tour' when asked to speak at high schools and colleges because 16-22 years old in America can't name another living poet doesn't mean that you're successful on the page.This collection begins with a poem titled \"Our Numbered Days\" where the poet quotes himself in between Andrew Jackson, Wikipedia, St. Catherine of Siena and Frida Kahlo. He does so on numerous iterations of the poem by the same name, substituting the aforementioned for people I didn't feel like googling when I did not recognize their name immediately.Hilborn mentions pretentiousness in the second poem and I can't quite shake the feeling that he was talking about himself.Give this as a gift to people who know nothing of modern poetry and they will love it because poets like this are why people hate poets.As remarkably flat this collection was to me, there were still a few worthy highlights worth mentioning below:\"Pretension / can look like intelligence if you squint / hard enough or wear glasses.\" - p. 5 (MSP PHI LGA ALB PHI MSP)\"And when your fourth love leaves you, / you will want to kill yourself but / you won't. / You no longer think of suicide / as a house you will build one day. .... Because of her. Because she asked for this. / Because she filled something in you that's still full, even though / she's gone.\" - p. 18 (Future Tense)\"This is what it's like to try to fall / asleep in a life raft. This is what it's like / to say goodnight and mean goodbye.\" - p. 33-34 (You Can Look)\"The first time I saw her, everything / in my head went quiet. All the tics, / all the constantly refreshing images, / just disappeared. When you have / Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, / you don't really get quiet moments. / Even in bed I'm thinking / did I lock the door yes / did I wash my hands yes / did I lock the door yes / did I wash my hands yes.\" - p. 38 (OCD)"

There's rage and there's passion and there's humour charging every word, and you can definitely tell that his work is written to be read aloud, which I recommend. He's a poet of obvious talent, and I'll be keeping an eye out for what else he does."

        "user_review": "This is one of the best Sci-Fi series ever written, comparable with the old classics and The Expanse, Reynolds, Banks, Scalzi, Stephenson, Simmons,… and I can´t say how much I love this novel. I was still really young when I read it the first time and Hamilton was the one who opened my mind for the immense possibilities of Sci-Fi. And the endless love story began,... I should consider rereading all he wrote again.He is the Stephen King of Sci-Fi, other genre authors might write less stereotypical, more believable, less controversial, more tech-focused,… but he ultimately checked that the fusion of persons, plots, sense of wonder, and worldbuilding is the key to readers' ultimate dreams. No passage, nothing that let´s one get out of the flow for a moment and that although there are flaws such as logic holes and other points people criticize in his work. But just as the mentioned King, he is so good at what he does that one doesn´t care because I must say that I have hardly ever read any Sci-Fi novels (it were hundreds) that were of a similar intensity.Hamilton fuses protagonists, plot, and world together, there is hardly ever any interaction, dialogue, that has no relevance and this differentiates him from many other Sci-Fi authors and genres. Hard-Sci-Fi has too much technobabble and too little identification with the characters and parts with them, social Sci-Fi hasn´t enough action, each subgenre has elements some group of readers could dislike. But Hamilton avoids them all, he has the epic, understandable, not too specific Hard-Sci-Fi infodump, the not too detailed characters that have chronic McGuffinitis and Chekhovitis and can´t move without pushing the story forward with their tech, biotech, psitech, lovetech, are entertainingly superficial social Sci-Fi and there are no lengths, although the novels are massive.That´s the most amazing thing, I´ve reread some passages I, in retrospect, couldn´t imagine having taken so many pages and described just a short passage, an extremely detailed, but still stunning mini chapter inside a chapter.One of the reasons why his writing is so great is that he has no background in natural sciences such as many authors and that brought him in a position of focusing on writing entertaining and avoiding too specific descriptions, instead getting better and better in plotting. You see, other Sci-Fi authors tend to over integrate elements of their professions and that can, if one isn´t into that kind of thing, get lengthy to boring for many readers. Too much astrophysics, tech, informatics, physics,… and, on the other hand, philosophy, sociology, social criticism, economics, politics,… make broad fields of Sci-Fi indigestible for readers with not so special interests.His genius can also be shown by comparing him with other popular Sci-Fi authors, who have different prioritization in their works. The Expanse is the only comparable universe that is so accessible, trope forming, and both character and plot driven.This wise, just joking, advice is added to all reviews of Hamiltons´series.One of the most fascinating aspects of Hamilton´s future vision is to see the technology and society developing in very detail over long periods of time, making a return to his universe something always stunning and inspiring. It also makes me wonder why he is the only author I know of who did this. One, who is new, lucky you, by the way, ought consider reading it in chronological order, although the series set closest to now, Salvation lost, is still unfinished, so better read before in the following order:Salvation year 2200Commonwealth year 2400The Night´s Dawn trilogy year 2700The Chronicle of the Fallers year 3400Void trilogy year 3600You can of course do as you wish, it´s just how I arrange my rereading to get the most out of it and slowly move further and further away from the boring present.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

Everyone knows something really BAD is happening in the Quallheim and yet the army takes a BOAT to get there, which takes a week, minimum. No. Just no.I really want to find out how it all comes together in the end. But so far I'm not invested in any of the characters and I can never read more than a couple of chapters before the book flies. Think I'll give this a miss."

        "user_review": "A bit of investment required to finish this.The Reality Dysfunctionis a monster of a book, boasting more than 1200 pages. It is also a somewhat distressing read. By the time the book hits one third there has been a multitude of uneasy things for the reader to digest. Rape; exploitation; satanic rituals; torture; murder and mutilation (where, in some cases, the victims are children); genocide; injuries inflicted to protagonists that will make the squeamish light-headed; demonic possession… to name but a few. It's also clear by this time that Hamilton is only getting started. Yes, it's that kind of book.It's riveting stuff though. Hamilton spins averygood yarn and he seems to be one of the few authors whocanactually write a story of this magnitude. Looking for a sense-of-wonder fix? Look no further. This is onebigstory, with a staggering plethora of characters and events surrounding the bigger picture. Yet, it really works. I read Hamilton'sCommonwealth Sagabefore this, even though it was published later, and it's clear that Hamilton thrives on this kind of thing.The second half of the book is really where it's at, with themes like redemption and sacrifice juxtaposed with the despair of the earlier portions. Pity it takes some effort to identify them through all the mayhem.In conclusion, don't let the difficult first half put you off, things pick up considerably (and then some) in the second half.Nightmare on Elm Streeton a galactic scale – that's what this is. Now, on to the similarly massive sequel (The Neutronium Alchemist) (or at least, once I gather my wits again).updateFinishing the trilogy has given me a more holistic perspective.It's good stuff all round, and I have rated the books consistently highly, but know this: if you start this you are in it for the long run. These books cannotbe read as standalone novels. In the end I found the trilogy worthwhile but exhausting. Don't let too much time pass between books. There's no medal for effort here, but finishingNight's Dawnis its own reward."

The first 1/4 almost is like running through a valley of quicksand, but I swear the momentum is worth it. I felt my interest waning sometimes because it is SO DENSE, but then, rather than stopping, I'd skim a bit forward over all the meticulous details of the worlds etc and get back on track with some of the characters. This book requires stamina but if you're into sci-fi is worth the effort. All the thought and imagination that went into this universe is breathtaking, truly beyond anything I could invent. The book definitely gets going at a certain point because you latch onto characters that are fascinating, and once the mystery behind the \"invaders\" becomes more evident you really can't wait to see what happens, or at least I couldn't. Anyway, for hard Sci-Fi people this is a great recc. Just be prepared for 3000+ pages of fun before the end. Off to book 2!"

        "user_review": "Awesome.When I went through law school and then bar school I was forced to eject many vital tidbits of information that were taking up valuable space in my brain: my address, my year of birth, etc. I have no idea how Peter F. Hamilton holds all of this massive universe, its technology and characters in one noggin. He clearly does not remember his wife's birthday or his underwear size. We all have to make sacrifices.The Reality Dysfunction is fun. Lots of fun. I flew through this book and forgave its flaws (there are some useless digressions but heck, I even enjoyed those). The action is incredible, the ideas are grand and the universe is relatively plausible. Hamilton's prose is not necessarily eloquent and sharp, but it is good. The story just powers through that.I'll address most people's two biggest critiques of Reality Dysfunction. First, yes it's long. The edition sold in Canada is over 1200 pages. Second, some people are disappointed with what the spooky threat ends up being (hereinafter: the \"Spolier Bit\"). With respect to the length, I'm no editor, but I'm sure this could have been clipped a bit with only a positive result. However, a good story is a good story. I'm over that. With respect to the Spoiler Bit, it's a matter of personal choice. Some like it, some don't. I know those two comments are not entirely helpful, but my point is that they should not detract from what is a kickass book.In a nutshell, this is the first book in a huge space opera trilogy. It qualifies as \"New Space Opera\" with all the verisimilitude in the science that goes along with that relatively new term. The novel is set in the 26th and 27th centuries with much of the story happening in 2610 and 2611 within a group named the Confederation. A handy timeline at the start of the book is not only useful to following during your reading but gives you some background when you start. Humans have split into two groups: Edenists embrace the introduction of biotechnology into the human genome and all the wacky consequences and Adamists stick to mechanical and cybernetic technology. Adamists are less well off to Edenists, a group with is comparable to Iain M. Banks' Culture on some levels. There is a whole chunk of religious, political and technological interest in the book, but the real story comes in the form of an unknown invader that is threatening first a planet in the Confederation and then perhaps even beyond.I'm very excited to continue onto the next volume, The Neutronium Alchemist."

        "user_review": "I really wanted to like this novel a lot. I wanted to get invested from the sheer length of the novel and come out the other side, saying, \"Wow, that was fantastic.\" Just because I'm not doesn't mean that the novel wasn't worthwhile, it just means that the negative qualities of it managed to outweigh what was good.Let's face it. A novel that is almost 1500 pages is either full of characters, full of story, or full of meandering and inconsequential shit that didn't really serve the final solid tale. I can sort of see why the planet got so much face time before the crap hit the palm. I can also see why the branches of humanity needed to get so much time as well. What I can't understand is why so much time was devoted to each. I swear, this would have been a fantastic novel with some serious cutting. The action scenes were good. The young captain was thoroughly enjoyable. I didn't even mind the turn of the sci-fi into practical fantasy. It was interesting.I would have thought it was more interesting at half the total size, too.Maybe I'm just overcritical and grouchy, but I really got tired of reading this novel in sections and just prayed for my favourite characters to come back.I think I got spoiled because I had read Leviathan Wakes long before I picked this novel up. I saw a lot of good similarities, but I'd always choose Leviathan over this. Perhaps one day I'll pick up the sequels to this one and pray it gets more fit, but I won't be doing it now."

        "user_review": "\"TL,DR. There are very few SF stories that justify more than 120,000 words.\"-Jo Walton's blog on Hugo Nominees: 1998Jo Walton is the best sf books reviewer extant (IMO), as an author she is no slouch either. Unfortunately for herThe Reality Dysfunctionis the exception that proves the rule, this is one of the \"very few SF stories\" that she is talking about. Certainly a book this magnitude, clocking on at over 1,200 pages, is dissuasive for many people. If you are interested in reading this book but feel intimidated by the high page count I suggest you treat this one volume book as you would an entire trilogy. Read one third, go read another book, come back read the second third, go read yet another book etc. Don't worry that there are two more gargantuan volumes in theNight Dawn Trilogy, you may not even want to read them! Sandwiching shorter books between long ones work wonders for me. Of course nowadays long novels are in vogue, especially for fantasy novels, clearly books this size is exactly what a lot of readers want.The Reality Dysfunction is Peter F. Hamilton's breakout book, it established him as the leading exponent of huge sprawling epic space operas. Still, I have to admire the author's gumption in writing a novel of such an uncompromising length, which is certainly not the norm for science fiction. He clearly did not do it for the money, he could have written shorter faster paced books and they probably wold have been easier to get published. He has this huge story to tell and he wants to tell and he will tell it in as many pages as necessary. The success of this book and the series as a whole totally vindicated him. His shorter books are far less popular than his whale size space operas.The Night Dawn Trilogy is essentially about humanity's fight for survival against invaders from another dimension. The twist is that the invaders are not aliens. To say any more would be venturing into spoiler territory, though if you have read other reviews you probably know what I'm being coy about already. Actually before I read this book somebody told me it is about space zombies, I thought may be it would be something likeDawn of The Deadin space which sounded like a hoot to me though I was surprised such a story could span three elephantine books. Any way, it is not about zombies, there are no zombies in The Reality Dysfunction (I can't speak for subsequent volumes at this point but I doubt the zoms will show up), but I now understand the oversimplification.As he is working on such a huge canvas Hamilton takes time to setup his pieces, worldbuilding, characters developing (so damn many of them), and meticulous plotting. For the first 300 or so pages I had no idea where the story is going, or who the main protagonists or antagonists are. The book is not hard to follow though, Hamilton has a clear clean prose style, not much in the way of lyricism but the more prosaic style is more practical for this kind of epic space opera I think. There are already so many worlds, species, people and cultures to introduce without further befuddling the readers with a poetic narrative. The author saves his inventiveness for his creations, living organic spaceships, cities, houses, all kinds of weird gadgets, and more alien and strange creatures than you can shake a stick at. This book is also, to some extent, a sci-fi/horror mash up, there are scenes of supernatural horror that I did not expect to find in a space opera. A lesser author would probably make the whole thing ridiculous but Hamilton is no ordinary author and he made it work. This book is also, to some extent, a sci-fi/horror mash up, there are scenes of supernatural horror that I did not expect to find in a space opera. A lesser author would probably make the whole thing ridiculous but Hamilton is no ordinary author and he made it work.As mentioned earlier there is a huge cast of characters and sometime it is hard to remember who is who, but he does return to a few main characters more than others. Many of the characters tend to be archetypes, the evil charismatic genius sociopath, the rebellious teenager straight off a daytime soap who gets more than she bargained for, the bad boy turned good etc. Characterization is not one of the strengths of this book, though the characters are not so flat as to leave you with no one to root for or want dead. There are also a lot of sex scenes in this book which I don't find particularly sexy or relevant to the story, certainly this is not a book to read to your children.The bookislonger than it needs to be, but not by too much; cutting down on the unnecessary sex scenes would probably shear off a centimetre or so from the book's thickness. But Hamilton makes it all worthwhile by the explosive end of this first volume where a small group of characters win a minor victory for humanity. The war itself has just begun of course.If you have never read Peter F. Hamilton before I would recommend readingPandora's Starfirst. This is the start of an entirely different series which he wrote some years later than this book, it is better written, more refined, and the characters are better developed. Still, if you insist on The Reality Dysfunction as your first Hamilton I doubt you will regret the decision. I am certainly going to read the next obese volumeThe Neutronium Alchemist. Damn you Mr. Hamilton, you are practically monopolizing my reading time!Update December 2013: Just readThe Neutronium Alchemist(my review) it is a substantial improvement onThe Reality Dysfunction. I particularly enjoy the chapters from the possessed people's point of view."

This is the second book by this author that I've read and both of them in my opinion were way too long and had rather ridiculous plot elements. This novel had so many characters to keep track of and so many intertwining plot lines that I couldn't set the book down for very long or I would lose the thread.It's too bad because I thought there were tons of good ideas in the course of things. For example, the sentient habitats and spaceships, biological rather than AI. Those reminded me of Iain Banks' Culture books, the AI Minds that populate that universe. The alternation between Tranquility habitat and the rough pioneer world of Lalonde made me think of Vinge'sA Fire Upon the Deep.What I have trouble with is thinking that there will still be Earth-based religions in 2520. I certainly think that Satanism will have been left far behind by then. Maybe Buddhism will survive, but surely we will have outgrown the other belief systems.I know I've set myself a mission to read most of the books on the list that I've devised, but there are 2 more volumes in this series and they are every bit as long as this one. I just can't face them. I had difficulty finishing this one. This is it, folks, I'm not reading any further.Book number 360 of my Science Fiction & Fantasy Reading Project"

        "user_review": "Vai… Înspăimântătoare a mai fost povestea asta. Înspăimântătoare, violentă, șocantă, năucitoare și halucinantă.Mi-e imposibil să rezum multitudinea de fire narative împletite atât de ingenios de către Hamilton. In principiu, peste aproximativ 500 de ani, omenirea a evadat din limitele Pământului suprapopulat și s-a împrăștiat printre stele, întemeind colonii pe lumi aflate la sute de mii de ani lumină. Dar pe una dintre aceste planete colonii, Lalonde,Răulpândește lacom lumea celor vii și își așteaptă chemarea. Încet, încet, ceva groaznic preia controlul fizic al coloniștilor de pe Lalonde, împrăștiindu-se cu o viteza amețitoare și amenințând nu doar omenirea ci chiar esența vieții inteligente. Și cum poți lupta cu ceva ce depășește rațiunea, ceva ce acționează după alte reguli decât cele ale universului fizic?Trebuie să recunosc că în primele 400-500 de pagini, n-aveam idee în ce direcție o va lua povestea: zeci de personaje, nenumărate planete, habitate vii, intrigi politice, conflicte tacite între diferite sisteme religioase, nave spațiale legate pe viață de căpitanii lor, arme ce au puterea de a distruge planete... Iar ceea ce a urmat... vai: satanism, exorcizări, crime, violuri, torturi,sufletele morților care tânjesc și zbiară fără încetare după senzațiile lumii fizice, mercenari amplificați fizic și genetic, lupte spațiale, lumi noi și specii extraterestre inteligente; e destul de dificil să ții pasul cu ritmul acțiunii și complexitatea universului creat de Hamilton.Pe de altă parte, dacă universul dinDisfuncția realitățiieste pur și simplu incredibil, personajele, chiar și cele principale, lasă de dorit. De exemplu, îl avem pe \"fermecătorul\" căpitanJoshua Calvertcăruia nu-i poate rezista nici o femeie și care iese întreg din orice situație,Syrinx, căpitanul șoimului-de-vid Oenone (și a căror legătura este una dintre cele mai emoționante și minunate creații din toată cartea),Ione Saldana, Lordul Ruinelor și coordonatoarea Seninătății și... și cam atât, restul personajelor se pierd în vâltoarea acțiunii. Ca să nu mai spun de misoginismul nu prea subtil care învăluie întreaga poveste. Dar poate caut eu nod în papură, lumea lui Hamilton este cu siguranță originală și terifiantă; parcă mi-e și teamă de ce voi găsi în volumul doi."

        "user_review": "It took a hell of a long time, but I've made it through The Reality Dysfunction, the first volume in a trilogy recommended to me by Ennis. It's a \"space opera\" about a futuristic society plagued by an evil force that \"sequestrates,\" or maybe just possesses, people.The story takes place in the Confederation in the 2600s. The set-up is quite detailed and interesting. One group, the Adamists, lives on a failing planet Earth and various other planets. The Adamists are mostly like the people of today, but with neural implants that allow them to \"datavise\" or communicate directly with computers. They have starships and nuclear weapons and whatnot. Another group, the Edenists, has a different kind of technology that is organic. Edenists have genetic changes that allow them to have an affinity bond with each other and with their habitats, which are miniplanets made entirely of organic matter. This bond allows them to share thoughts and feelings inside their own heads, without speaking, and to see through other people's eyes. They also have spaceships that are organic and have personalities and memories. When Edenists die, the intangible part of them is absorbed into the habitat. The distinction between the two groups is essentially religious; they trade and coexist more or less peacefully.The plot of the book revolves around a new planet, Lalonde, which is being settled under a Dutch East India Company-esque scheme. Colonists have bought in, and come from Earth or other failing urban planets to farm. We see a group of the colonists struggling to get their village, Aberdale, up and running. This is fresh stuff--after all, in sci-fi like Star Wars and Firefly, the farmers are just there as redshirts or comic relief. However, an evil force appears on the planet and begins to take over villages and people in a mysterious way. The book has a huge number of characters, including Joshua \"Self-Insert\" Calvert, a strapping starship captain with remarkable sexual and technical skills, and many female figures that are almost characterized well enough for you to be able to tell them apart. There is a planet with a culture nostalgic for 19th century England and a bunch of marines who have huge machine guns welded to their forearms. So while Lalonde turns out to be central to the plot, it doesn't dominate in terms of number of pages. There is a lot going on here, and some if it must pertain to the later volumes of the trilogy, since it doesn't pan out in this one.This book is either rather good or completely terrible. The author is certainly inventive, but I often had occasion to wish that he'd handed over his ideas to someone else to write. The pacing here is frustrating. At times, he is so enamored of discussing planetary trajectories and technology that you wonder if you will ever see a sentient being again. There seems to be little structure governing the arrangement of scenes. There are problems with the POV. You'll be reading about Person A doing something from the point of view of Person B, watching them from 20 yards away. Then all of a sudden you're in Person A's head. Or, scenes of a space battle cut back and forth between the POVs of people in different, even opposing spaceships, with no notice. This problem is so basic to telling a story that I'd expect even a novice to avoid it instinctually.The novel is quite long and there are two volumes left. In the end, I feel about it the way I did about A Game of Thrones. It has its good and bad points, and I thought I was intrigued enough by the plot to read the sequels, but I never did. We'll see about this one."

        "user_review": "This is the worst-written book I've ever read twice. Hamilton is not just a bad writer but a bad writer in a hurry--superabundantly verbose, careless about style and tone, overdescriptive, flaccidly repetitive, malapropistic when he isn't spouting tired old cliches. He's a lousy scene-painter, too, careless about details and how they fit together and given to commencing every descriptive paragraph with the physical dimensions of whatever is being described--twenty kilometers long and weighing nine hundred thousand tonnes, that kind of thing. None of his visions is in the least original, none of his ideas are new or even newly crafted. His basic premise--dead souls returning from the afterlife, defying the laws of physics by means of a conveniently-named 'reality dysfunction' to sieze the bodies of the living and possess them--abounds with metaphysical inconsistenies and scientific impossibilities. And his sex scenes, gratuitously introduced whenever he feels the action is flagging a bit, make signally unpleasant reading. Women, in particular, may feel the need to take a shower after a few pages of being pleasured by Hamilton's priapic heroes and villains.There is also a vast oversupply of pornoviolence, most of which I skipped.All of which begs the question of why I have just re-read this book and its sequel volume with great enjoyment, and am now halfway through the final book in the trilogy.I suppose it helps that theNight's Dawntrilogy is action-packed, spectacular space opera, and that bad as the writing is, it is also compelling: you just devour it, ugly bits and all, you're so eager to learn what happens next. The multiple storylines, though mostly absurd, are still humdingers. There are hundreds of characters and the principal ones, walking cliches though they be, are engaging enough to keep you interested. The dozens of subplots twist and turn all over the place, and if the outcome of no scene is ever in doubt, Hamilton still manages to spring a surprise or two to keep us interested.But all these are just self-justifications, really. I consider myself a literary gourmet, and this book is a bit like junk food--tasty in a crude way, unwholesome and empty of real nourishment. Yet even a gourmet may relish a Big Mac once in a way."

        "user_review": "Ah, the Night's Dawn Trilogy. One of the most amazing, wild space opera's ever written. In the UK it is 3 massive books, while here in the US they nickel-and-dimed us by splitting them up into 6. It doesn't really matter though, because it is not so much a trilogy as it is one gigantic continuous story, regardless of where they are split. One book ends at whatever chapter, and the following book simply begins at the next.Peter Hamilton is probably my favorite SF writer when it comes to world building and action. In this series, he skillfully synthesizes the best aspects of cyberpunk, space opera and even horror, and creates tons of different planets, each one vivid and unique. He has a knack for describing some minor detail like the local economy of a big city planet or the landscape of some frontier world colony that brings the scene to life in the reader's imagination.After creating this very high-tech universe, a supernatural element is introduced to the story (I highly recommend that anyone interested in this series avoid reading any plot synopses on the books). While I am generally extremely averse to anything resembling magic in my SF, Hamilton pulls it off. The magical element is described in a very scientific manner, making it more palatable, and the SF elements are enough to send me into multiple geekgasms.I should mention that the first 60 pages or so are a tad difficult to get into, but after that it just begins to flow. Additionally, I must admit that the sex sometimes comes off as a tad juvenile. And finally, I hate to say it, but the ending is kind of anticlimactic. However, the ride is so amazing that any of these downsides are far overshadowed.While this is not primarily an action story, when it does first hit at around 200 or so pages in, it is some of the most enthralling I have read. Only Neal Asher has come close to matching Hamilton in conveying the kind of kinetic, over-the-top action contained in this story."

        "user_review": "Re-read because I own the two following installments in the series, but couldn't remember much about \"The Reality Dysfunction\" (apart from the fact that I enjoyed it heaps) as I read it back in 2000...maybe 2001.What we've got here is super-advanced technology featuring sentient starships able to give birth to other starships. The commanders of said starships grow inside/with them, and are sort of telepathically connected with them, and treat them like brothers, parents and, in general, family...which is a pretty fucking amazing concept, if you ask me.(Art by Paul Chadeisson)The first twenty chapters or so are equally divided between space & starships and the surface of the planet Lalonde which is some kind of tropical rainforest paradise far from being hyper-technologically advanced. Of course, Lalonde has got its own flora and fauna with trees whose wood is hard as steel, and dangerous predators like sayces & croklions (the latter being some sort of mythological creature, like the bunyip and the drop bear, y'know).(Art by Nicolas Bouvier)The book features satanists as well (aye, you got that right,satanists!). And a very ancient invisible energy being everybody is oblivious of, which, at some point, starts toliterallyfuck everything up in Lalonde. In the worst possible way.And that's about it, otherwise I'll end up spoiling the whole thing bigtime.OK, at the end of the day, I'm glad to report that \"The Reality Dysfunction\"DELIVERSand hasn't lost its appeal after all these years.Five stars.(Oh, there's plenty of SEX as well. I like dirty stuff myself. Well, there is a BIG BOWL of sex in here, hey! So even better.)"

I think there's really only two things holding it back from full 5 star territory and that's how long the book takes to get going and how weirdly horny it is in the first half. Otherwise it just really went for it with crazy stuff. Good action, epic worldbuilding, mystery, horror, and good characters even if maybe the cast is a little big and you won't click with everyone. Overall I'm very into this now and I'll finish the trilogy by the end of the year."

There are some neat ideas in here, and I love the affinity-bonded relationships with bitek (biotech) ships and habitats. I'm curious about what ended the decimated alien civilization that left the ruins, too, but not enough to hack my way through this. Notes / highlights follow my progression from mild consternation about the race and gender stuff ...through sexual violence and female characters defined by their biology, and sexualizing kids... to much more than mild consternation.This postandthis onedo a pretty handy job of articulating the things I couldn't get past. (Also, and next to those issues it is a mere quibble, but there is no writer more committed to giving measurements of every. physical. object. the reader encounters.)There are so many better examples of expansive, centuries-spanning space opera that manage to do those things without all the WTF.CW forrape, sexual slavery, gross male-gazey descriptions of female children/teenagers, casual statutory rape, animal cruelty and blood sport, murder, weird racial stuff and emphasis on \"ethnic\" segregation by planet, holy shit the fat-shaming, and the book's antagonist, who is a Satanist, rapist, murderer, etc.,alsojust happens to be the only gay character in several star systems--probably coincidence, right? I'm sure I missed some, but those are the obvious ones.UPDATE to add: When I wrote that there is no writer more committed to endless measurements of physical objects, I had not yet encountered Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea."

        "user_review": "4 StarsReality Dysfunction by Peter Hamilton stole me from reality for quite some time. Coming in at over 1200 pages in length, this book is a massive endeavor. Fortunately for me Peter Hamilton writes hard science fiction and he specializes in his world building and imagination. Reality Dysfunction excels at both of these things. The best thing about this book was the world that he built within. The story and the characters are almost irrelevant and forgettable compared to the universe within.The book is very difficult to keep things straight for the first couple of hundred pages as the cast is immense. Things are made tougher in that none of the characters standout. However, the incredible starships steal the pages and are definitely unforgettable. Hamilton treats the reader to an incredible chapter that was Kinetic and exhilarating in which we see the birth of a new starship. Freaking awesome!I love magic and the supernatural and Hamilton treats it with a light hand but...I really lost interest when the supernatural powers became the front and center. No scientific explanation worked for me. I almost skim read large portions of the last couple of hundred pages.I am a huge good fan of Peter Hamilton, he is one of my very favorite authors. I loved a great deal of this book is, but in the end, there just was too much book here to love."

        "user_review": "Unfortunately The Night's Dawn trilogy is a huge, festering shamble where a few nuggets of interesting story is drowned in a horribly over-long stream of irrelevant and meandering side- and subplots. It starts off ok, focusing on just one plotline, which leads up to a rather nice \"?\" moment, but then it seems like Hamilton lost all his marbles because the story loses all focus and coherence, and the only thing that kept me painfully reading the last 4000 pages was to find out how in the world he would be able to tie everything together in the end (which, regrettably turned out to be a big fizzling anticlimactic Deus Ex Machina disappointment).His male characters have an unfortunate tendency to be rather flat and Mary Sue-ish, and he can't really write female characters at all, but his vivid imagination makes for at least potentially interesting stories IMO. Too bad you have to plough your way through thousands of pages of irrelevant fluff to get to the good parts."

        "user_review": "What an marathon this book was for me, it took me almost 40 days to finish this book.The Reality Dysfunctionis not for a weak hearted, it is 1223 pages long and whooping 41 hours in audio.Hamiltongoes to super detail describing anything in this book be it a species a planet or a star ship. And many times due to this attention to detail I lost regarding where we are as regards to story.Also as I mostly hear audio to and fro from work, I used to doze off and had to start entire chapter again. Imagine listening to 1.5 hours chapter again.Hamiltontakes a lot of time establishing the confederation universe for you, but once you are immersed in his world its an tremendous journey. Especially the last part of book picks up a lot and ends with a bang.Some of the strong points of book are1.Characters2.Technology3.World buildingSome of the weak points of book are1.Overly VerboseLet me elaborate on the above points now1.CharactersAs is expected fromHamiltonthere are lots of characters in this book each unique from each other. But some of them do stand out, and the story weaves around them.Few characters which I liked in this book are1.Joshua CalbertHe is a star ship captain, and makes his living by scavenging artifacts of a race which has been destroyed thousands of years ago.Also lady luck tends to favor him a lot as he always manages to find something unique.We don't get much back ground story as regards to him which was a big surprise for me.2.Quinn DexterHe is a convicted criminal who has been sentenced to public duty for a period of 10 years, and as part of that he heads to the planetLa Londe.Unknown to the authorities are the fact that he belongs to a satanist cult and has powerful sensors hidden in his body.He uses both of these weapons to full extent, and unleashes a dangerous thing on the confederation.3.LatonHe is an edenist serpent who has been hiding onLa Londefor a long time, he is obsessed with immortality and will leave no stone upturned to achieve it.2.TechnologyIt's 26th century and humanity is spread across hundreds of world. They manage to traverse to these worlds with the use of FTL technology or by means of biotek ships.Now humanity as a whole is divided into two types in Confederation.1.EdenistsThey have affinity gene embedded in their DNA which allows them to telepathically communicate with each other. They also have life spans of about 120-140.They reside in special habitats called as biotek habitats, these habitats are responsible for control of everything in that world, from educating the children to providing food to the people.The edenists divide everything equally among their peers, and treat each others as equals.Their are some special people among Edenist who get to command anVoid hawk. Now Void hawks are biotek ships who are bonded to their captain with affinity gene, also they are able to traverse huge distances.2.AdamistsThey are people who don't have affinity gene embedded in their DNA, but they have bio engineered their bodies for different purposes.They also use neural mnemonics which is a sort of google glass taken to their next level, it helps them to gather data or chart ship courses. It is also used when a person suffers an injury to automatically push drugs into his system.This is just an summary of technology whichHamiltonencompasses in his book.3.World buildingHamiltonhas gone to next level regarding his world building in this book, he leads into many worlds in this book.But not only you get the history of the world but also get description of flora and fauna existing on that world. He also gives you a deep insight into economics of that world.Regarding the weak points of the book1.Overly VerboseThe tremendous attention to detail makes this book an difficult read, you just lose the place in the story many times.The experience would have been definitely better if 100-200 pages of the book could have been reduced.I give this book 4/5 stars."

I thought at first that the author might just need a really good editor, especially since the first half dozen chapters kept introducing entirely new settings and characters. It was difficult to get into because it didn't seem to focus on any one plot and it was hard to remember who was who. However, all the different threads slowly began to weave together and my patience was rewarded. Despite the massive page count, it never seemed wordy and it certainly never dragged. It may have helped that I flipped back and forth between this and other books instead of trying to devour this in one go, but I never got tired of the story and am eager to start volume #2."

Since I read those first, it didn't feel as fresh or unique and since this was a very early novel in Hamilton's career, the writing wasn't as good. The dizzying caste of characters was too dizzying and I lost insight/connections to several of them. The bad guys are a bit hand wavey, their skills and motivations seem to change depending on the situation. Maybe there is a larger plan to tie it all together but I am not sure I want to wade through the other 2000 pages to find out. Some characters good, plot line decent but nothing awesome.I am not sure if I will read the next book, right now I am leaning no but I am definitely on the fence."

This book is big, bold, complex, dense, and unapologetically dark; like really dark man. Would call this sci-fi horror easily since the darkness and disturbing events are so pervasive. As a fan of dark horror books, really liked this aspect and we don't see it enough in sci-fi.Peter F Hamilton is cemented as one of my favorite sci-fi authors after loving his Commonwealth Saga series. He continues to impress with his unique blend of sci-fi that balances ideas, characters, technology, and vivid worlds - among many other things.Also, even though I'd classify this as a space opera and the scale is indeed big, we do get a lot of page time on a single planet which is refreshing for the genre as we get a lot of time experiencing the richness of this one world and the people, the aliens, and the strange wildlife that lives there.This book is also really weird and isn't afraid to have crazy stuff happen. There's a lot of mystery for why this weird stuff is happening and there seems to be some unrevealed logic to why these things are happening.I don't think I'd recommend this book to most people, but if you're brave enough to commit to these giant tomes he writes you'll be rewarded with a very rich and interesting portal into one of sci-fi's greatest imaginations.The book also seemed to fly by and I was always interested in what was going to happen next, the pacing is very good and never felt like any part really overstayed its welcome. Lots of POVs that all feel distinct and interesting.I honestly have no idea where this series is going to go, but I have some tinfoil hat theories and excited to continue and experience the ride."

        "user_review": "Peter Hamilton built a really interesting space opera universe in The Reality Dysfunction with a lot of potential. He then ruined it with a rambling, juvenile, magical-spiritualistic plot that feels very out of place in said universe.Did I mention rambling? I think the first plot point of significance is somewhere around page 400 or so. I didn't feel like there was significant plot movement until well over halfway through. I'll admit, if you overlook the absurd premise, the story telling gets interesting towards the end, but then of course, the story doesn't actually end with the book (not even close) -- he apparently needs two other equally wordy tomes for that task. These books make George R.R. Martin look concise, with lots of pointless exposition.And then there are the characters, which despite the future setting seem terribly outdated. Rife with weak-willed women who seem to exist only to provide sex. Then there's the main character, Joshua, who is developed sloppily, and lacks depth -- galavanting around like James Bond -- making women magically swoon and always cleverly outwitting problem situations with flair. All of the characters seem more like caricatures than believable people. The book varies from slightly to blatantly misogynist, with some slightly racist undertones to boot.I probably could've stomached all of this if it were 300 pages, but it's 1100. It was more of a grind than a pleasure to read, and I suspect the high ratings are from a small audience who actually likes this magical drivel, vice the thousands of people who started this book and made the right choice to quit. If you like space opera and science fiction that doesn't drip with Christian pseudo-babble and has modern, believable, characters, steer clear."

The technology is interesting and creative, but almost always serves to fuel the plot rather than to show off the authors imagination.Following this book I have continued to read just about every other book Hamilton has written, and loved them all.... he is one of the few authors I pre-order from Amazon."

We follow many strand and many, many characters. The ideas of living ships and the Adamists and the Edenists and other concepts were incredible. This is definitely hard science fiction, but unlike a lot of hard science where there is little plot and even less fun, this book is pure space opera.My advice is to keep plodding. Take breaks if you have to, but it is well worth the persistence."

        "user_review": "This semester I am requiring my students to readThe True Story of Hansel and Gretel, a novel takes place in Poland during World War II. The good news is that my students love the book; in fact, several of them are reading ahead.The shocking fact, the bad news, is what they don't know. It is not just knowledge of history that they lack; it is knowledge of basic geography.God bless PowerPoint and blackboard.To be fair, my students do ask intelligent questions, yet the lack of basic knowledge is shocking. At times, I feel like I am teaching a culture and history course in addition to a reading skills course.Now, I don't think it is the students' fault. I think the fault lies with the schools as well as parents and special interest groups. Here's why.There is a group called PABBIS (Parents against Bad Books in Schools). I disagree with them on so many different levels, but their website does have two good features. It actually quotes the material they find objectionable, and it has a complete list of banned and challenged books (as recent as 4-5 years ago).The Devil's Arithmeticis on that list by the way.Everything by Stephen King makes the list. Everything by Dahl, Blume, Block. There are a fewBlack Stallionbooks on the list as isBlack Beauty,Harry Potter,His Dark Materials,Three to Tango,The Diary of Anne Frank,The Lorax, and Shakespeare.In other words, pretty much anything good.Lately, history and science text books have been subjected to strange changes (i.e. as in Texas) and warning labels (usually about evolution).In terms banning and challenging books, I might under the idea if the book was being assigned at an inappropriate grade level, sayBelovedto first graders. Why an exceptional first grader might not have a problem with such a book, there are several things wrong, in general, about such assignment, least of which is the subject matter. Yet, I have never heard of such an assignment. Age appropriateness isn't really the issue. It seems to rest on what might offend any group, anywhere.Take, for instance,The Diary of Anne Frank. This book has been banned, challenged, and rejected by parents and text book committees because of the sex and tragedy of the story.Raisin in the Sunhas been banned and challenged because it's pornographic. (Can someone please, please show me where?).I can certainly see whyThe Devil's Arithmeticis banned. It is the mention of a wedding.Blatantly heterosexual.Okay, it's most likely due to the violence (it's about the Holocaust) and the ending.Romeo and Julietwas dissed by a teacher who said it was a blatant endorsement of heterosexual love (so I guess teen suicide is okay).BUT, Yolen's magnificent book is exactly the type of book that should be used in schools.Let's face it, the wrong text book and/or the wrong teacher can make history very boring, and sometimes people just don't like learning about history for a variety of reasons. This is the reason why good historical fiction should be used in schools. A good historical novel can get a reader interested in a period, in an event, in a person. This true, to a degree, of such less accurate work thanThe Devil's Arithmetic.300caused some people to become interested in the Spartans,Titanicin the actual ship. In terms of books, vampire novels and historical fiction, such asThe Other Boleyn Girlalso cause readers to become interested in the actual events or myths that the novel is based on. Curiosity and a desire to learn are fueled by a variety of things; interest is one of them.The Devil's Arithmeticis precisely the type of book that for young readers can help history seem more real and, perhaps, get a reader interested in history. Yolen does not talk down to her readers, her main character is sympathetic, an older sibling, and because Yolen doesn't pull her punches, it is a real history, not a feel good history. This makes the story far more compelling and interesting. The story is told actively and quickly. Words are not wasted. The reader learns but is not lectured to and screamed at.Because of this reality and vividness, parents object to the story, and this raises the question of whether teachers and parents should sugarcoat history. It's true that are plenty of novels and movies that present history in a more flattering light (look at the perfect teeth, the clean bodies, the small pox vaccination scars). A reader can quite easily find it in any average romance novel. Such writing does serve a sense of purpose, escapism, and there is nothing wrong with that.But that is not education.Is this what parents want a school to be?I hope not. I suppose it is easy for me to comment onappropriateness and the evil of banning because I don't have a child, and I was raised in a house where you were encouraged to read what you wanted. I see, however, the effects of banning and challenging which are a total lack of knowledge or, worse, a lack of interest about a subject because the subject has been taught in such a sterile environment, so devoid of any color or shading, where everything is the color and taste of sugar; where everyone in the world has always treated everyone with respect and love, where women always had the right to vote, and slavery only existed in North and South America, and was totally destroyed by the American Civil War.Good literature, of whichThe Devil's Arithmeticis a prime example forces its readers to examine their own knowledge and lack of knowledge, forces readers to think about their own responses, notions, and stereotypes. Good literature teaches or enlightens the reader even if the reader already knows. It is a bond between writer, book, and reader that is no less real than those ties of family and society that provide the excuse for book banning."

        "user_review": "I wish I could say I liked this book. I thought I would. I know it's critically acclaimed and a well-known story. But it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.The book is meant to educate young people about the Holocaust, but it had a lot of historical inaccuracies. The idyllic shtetl world at the beginning of Chaya's story would have been long gone by 1942 -- by that time, all the Jews left alive in Poland were in ghettos, in concentration camps or in hiding. Lublin, the place Chaya supposedly came from, was ghettoized and in early 1942, most of its Jewish population was deported to Belzec and killed.The dialogue was overly didactic (a common flaw in historical novels, especially those for children) and too much was told rather than shown. Further, the camp confused me. Yolen says in the end that she created an amalgam fictional camp out of various aspects of real camps, but she used the trademark Auschwitz sign: \"Arbeit Macht Frei.\" I was confused throughout the book: This is Auschwitz? But where are the selections, the band, Mengele? Did she do any research at all, I wondered. Yolen should have revealed her use of a made-up camp at the beginning, and she shouldn't have used the Auschwitz sign.If you want to look for some better books on the Holocaust for children, try any of Uri Orlev's, or Jerry Spinelli'sMilkweed, or Livia Bitton-Jackson's memoirI Have Lived a Thousand Years, or...well, quite a few books are better than this one."

Although I have since been drawn to literature from that period, I feel that the gory inThe Devil's Arithmeticis too harsh for anyone under 12. The heart rending portrayal of children inMapping the Bones, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, Anne Frank's Diary, The Book Thief, The girl in the red coat in Schindler's List…make sure that the atrocities that children were subjected to during the holocaust are never forgotten.InThe Devil's Arithmeticwhen during the Passover, Hanna from 1990s' New York opens the door of her grandparents' apartment to look for Prophet Elijah, she finds herself in Poland of 1941 as Chaya. The very next day, she is sent off to a concentration camp where surrounded by cruelty she grows up too quickly and too seriously. Hope kept her alive as she stuck to senseless rules to increase her chance at survival. Chaya's story ends abruptly with a pang and by the time she is transported back to the apartment in New York, she has matured into a person who understood the significance of remembering.The plot device used in this historical fiction puts young readers at ease because they know that despite the hardships Chaya faces, she will become Hannah by the end of the book. A really moving read."

        "user_review": "This is a marvelous book for young adults, although I wouldn't recommend it as their first introduction to the holocaust because it portrays the atrocities committed in a starkly realistic way. And, unlike some young adult books that I enjoyed as young as nine or ten years old, I wouldn't give this to kids until they were at least 12.It is a wonderful story and, because the main character, an American Jewish girl who's 12 years old, is from the present time (even though the book was written twenty years ago, it still has a sufficiently modern feel) readers can perhaps empathize with her and the experiences she has when she goes back in time to Poland during the Nazi holocaust. I thought Jane Yolen had a truly inspired way to tell this story. Even readers who do not normally enjoy history or historical fiction will probably appreciate this book because the time travel nature of the story allows a contemporary young person to truly experience events of the past. (I've always loved history and historical fiction, but I know that some young people are not so interested.)The characters are likeable and believable and the ending is smart and heartwarming. All through the book there are hints about how the story will evolve and in a way it was predictable, but the details of the ending caught me by surprise, even though I was looking for the gist of what did happen.It's a terrific family story and it could make for intimate discussions between young adults and their adult family members. I'm also strongly in favor of it being taught in schools as part of the curricula for holocaust studies and history lessons."

I can relate to Hannah, because I remember being 13 and having little patience with traditions and customs, and just wanting to hang out with my friends.But given the experience Hannah had, she was able to see things in a new way, and was granted a gift, even though it was at a great cost, to be able to know and really understand her family's past and how they became who they are. And because of this, she gains a newfound respect and admiration for them, and her own life, that she might not have otherwise known.This is the lesson that this book taught me. Yes, it was about the Holocaust and the epic tragedy that occurred, but I think it was more about understanding and respecting where you come from, and not letting trivial everyday teenage life get in the way of honoring your past.***SPOILERS BELOW***Ultimately, I gave this one 4 stars only because the book never really explained who/whereChayawas really.With these types of books, where someone goes back in time into the body of another person, I always wonder where the person who is inhabited goes when the person who is inhabiting them is there.DidChayadie when she was ill, allowing Hannah to come back in order make her a hero to her Aunt? Or didChayasort of get shunted off to the side when Hannah took over, which means thatChayahad no choice in the sacrifice she made?I hope the latter is not the case, although near the end it is mentioned that Hannah has 3 sets of memories -- of being in Lublin, of being with Gitl and Schmuel, and of her American family. It seems to me that Hannah should only have had 2 sets of memories ifChayawas not in there somewhere.The last possibility is thatChayawas Hannah in a past life, whose life Hannah had a vision of (throughChaya'seyes, perhaps?) at just the right moment to attain the perspective she needed... Of the three, this is the most appealing to me, although some aspects of the story don't fit perfectly with this theory.Overall, I am very glad that I read this book, and would highly recommend it."

This wasn't the first time I'd encountered the Holocaust, but it was the first time it had been so immersive and real. I loved everything from the time-travel, to the storytelling, to realizing just what her great aunt and uncle had been through. I've shared this story with all four of my children now, and I feel like it is an excellent introduction to the Holocaust."

Then I couldn't get to sleep at night because I was too busy pondering how civilized societies are capable of butchering millions of people. It seems so impossible, and yet it's happened more than once in history.It makes you look at your friends and neighbors and wonder what sort of hearts of darkness might be there.And it makes you wonder what might happen again in the future. What would I do if the government came for me or for my neighbors?I know it's not the purpose of the book--but it did make me want to go out and buy a gun for the first time in my life. If the Jews had been armed, it would have been a different story.Anyway, this was a good book and it made you think--although I go back and forth as to whether it should really be in the juvenile section. I'm not sure it's a book I'd choose for an eight year-old. I mean, if I had trouble sleeping after reading this book, it might be too much for a young child to handle. Parents should probably read it before checking it out for their children."

        "user_review": "I read this because it's the subject ofAttack of the Black Rectangles, a middle-grade novel about censorship. Honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about a time-slip novel about the Holocaust. It doesn't seem quite right, especially in the chapters where Hannah/Chaya's ignorance about rural Jewish life in 1940s Europe is the butt of the joke. Yet, the novel comes to a solid emotional conclusion, and I understand why Yolen chose to tell the story in this way. Unfortunately for her and the whole world, Holocaust denialism is still alive and well 30 years later, but I prefer to privilege survivor's stories and other true stories rather than fiction.The Devil's Arithmeticrisks sensationalizing the extremely sensitive material with its time-slip story.There is also little risk at the end, when Hannah/Chaya sacrifices herself for Rivka/Rose, because we know she won't die. \"Saved from the Holocaust by a time-slip\" is just not doing it for me as a reader.Yet, I found nothing in this book to censor, nor would I ban it (or other Holocaust books) from any school library."

        "user_review": "Summary: When Hannah opens the door during Passover Seder to symbolically welcome the profit Elijah, she suddenly finds herself in the unfamiliar world of a Polish village i the 1940's. Hannah had always complained about listening about listening to her relatives tell the same stories of the Holocaust over and over, but now she finds herself in terrifying situation. The Nazi soldiers have come to take the villagers away, and Hannah can guess where they are going.Response: I loved this book. Being Jewish, Passover is a huge holiday in my family. I can relate to Hannah. I remember thinking that Passover Seders were boring when I was younger. It wasn't until I was older that I learned to fully appreciate the holiday. This book transforms the reader into the Holocaust through the eyes of a child. I think this would be an excellent book to use in the classroom during the study of the Holocaust to show the students a different perspective."

        "user_review": "Twelve year old Hannah is sick of spending Passover 'remembering' the past with her relatives. During the Passover Seder, she is transported to 1942 Poland, where she becomes Chaya (her Hebrew name), the girl she was named for. In this time, she is eventually sent to a concentration camp, where the bulk of the story takes place. Throughout the book, she struggles with memory - which memories are real (the future or the now), remembering anything b/c of the trauma of the camp, futilely trying to use her future-memory to warn those around her, etc.The story is chilling. And it is beautiful and sad. And it is an amazing combination of historical fiction and s/f.Some of my favorite quotations:\"Passover isn't about eating, Hannah,\" her mother began at last, sighing and pushing her fingers through her silver-streaked hair. \"You could have fooled me,\" Hannah muttered. (4)But as the scissors snip-snapped through her hair and the razor shaved the rest, she realized with a sudden awful panic that she could no longer recall anything from the past. I cannot remember, she whispered to herself. I cannot remember. She's been shorn of memory as brutally as she'd been shorn of her hair, without permission, without reason...Gone, all gone, she thought again wildly, no longer even sure what was gone, what she was mourning. (94)\"We all have such stories. It is a brutal arithmetic. But I - I am alive. You are alive. As long as we breathe, we can see and hear. As long as we can remember, all those gone before are alive inside us.\" (113)The days' routines were as before, the only change being the constant redness of the sky as trainloads of nameless zugangi were shipped along the rails of death. Still the camp seemed curiously lightened because of it, as if everyone knew that as long as others were processed, they would not be. A simple bit of mathematics, like subtraction, where on taken away at the top line becomes one added on to the bottom. The Devil's arithmetic.\" (146)"

She finds, suddenly, that she has been transported back to 1941 Poland, where she is sent to a concentration camp.The details of the travel to the camp as well as her time in the camp are vivid and shocking to Hannah, and, consequently, to us as readers. People die as a result of the conditions, and some are put to death right in front of Hannah. The food is meager and the guards are brutal. All of this is in sharp contrast to Hannah's modern life, and, again, we as readers are able to experience the horrors of that time just as Hannah is experiencing it.There are a few references to Hannah's modern life that might be unfamiliar to contemporary readers, but these can be easily explained. I found it to be a very powerful story. We must not forget.A 1001 Children's Book."

        "user_review": "For me, picking up a book about the Holocaust is a bit like plunging into an icy-cold lake, on a warm summer day. Not because the experience is refreshing - far from it! - but because there is this sense, while standing on the edge, poised to take that fateful step, of drawing back. An instinctive recoiling from what I know will be a sudden and shocking submersion in a different world - one that I'm never entirely prepared to enter, that I fear will swallow me whole, as I sink like a stone, down and down into the cold, dark depths.Since the day I stumbled across my first Holocaust memoir - Sara Zyskind'sStolen Years, which chronicles the author's time in the Lodz Ghetto, and then the Auschwitz-Birkenau death-camp - the year I was eleven, I have had an abiding interest in this terrible episode of history, and a desire to understand what made it, and other genocides, possible. I have, over the years, read numerous survivor testimonies, and devoted much time to considering the nature of human evil, the ubiquity of human suffering, and the historical, cultural, and psychological factors that allow them to flourish. I believe in remembering, in bearing witness, and - to the best of my limited ability - in seeking to oppose and change those factors which facilitate such atrocities.But no one (amongst the \"sane,\" anyway) can remember all the time. I don't spend every waking hour contemplating these issues, and I don't desire to. Which isn't to say I \"forget\" them, per se, just that the intimacy of my knowledge, of my remembering, varies greatly. I always \"remember\" the Holocaust. But the remembering involved in sociological analysis, and the remembering that comes of witnessing - even if only through the printed word - a vulnerable young child, violently separated from his only kin, tossed about in a maelstrom born of adult depravity, depart this world through the doors of the gas chamber, and the smokestacks of those infernal human-powered ovens, are two very different things. To read a book about the Holocaust, be it fact or fiction, is to embrace that second kind of remembering, to become acquainted, once again, with madness.And that seems like an entirely appropriate jumping-off point to me, because this book, this children's novel, is about nothing so much as memory, and our (very natural) reluctance to embrace it. It is the story of a contemporary Jewish American girl who, reluctantly attending her family's Passover Seder, opens the door for the Prophet Elijah, and finds herself in 1940s Poland. Hannah Stern of New Rochelle (five minutes from where I myself live) is now Chaya Abramowicz of Lublin, and a suburban girl who has always lived a life of privilege and plenty is about to discover a world of unimaginable loss and privation. For the small Jewish shtetl in which she finds herself is about to be liquidated - transported to one of the Nazi death camps...The Devil's Arithmeticis a powerful argument for the importance - the necessity - of remembering, but it is also a meditation on the difficulty of convincing others of the truth, and the limitations of knowledge itself, when confronting the full power of evil unleashed. Hannah/Chaya knows what is coming - she knows what those Nazis and their trucks in front of the village shul mean, she knows where the cattle cars are headed. But although she attempts to warn the others, tries desperately to convince them to flee, no one will believe her. She is, after all, just a child - a child known to say odd things, because of a recent illness - andwhatshe is saying is so unimaginably terrifying to her listeners, that she is silenced - hushed by her \"Aunt\" Gitl.Eventually, she is silenced by the loss of memory itself. Horrified, the first night in camp, by the showers toward which she and the other women are being herded, convinced that they are really the gas chambers about which she had learned, in her other life, Hannah/Chaya once again attempts to warn the others. But finally, perceiving that theycannothear her words, that she is only robbing them of their last protection, robbing them of hope, she desists, only to find this silence reinforced by a horrifying inability to recall who she really is, and what lies ahead:When the man came to Hannah, she bit her lip so as not to cry and kept her eyes closed the entire time. She concentrated on what was to happen next - after the showers and the hair-cutting, remembering from the lessons in Holocaust history in school. But as the scissors snip-snapped through her hair and the razor shaved the rest, she realized with a sudden awful panic that she could no longer recall anything from the past. \"I cannot remember,\" she whispered to herself. \"I cannot remember.\" She'd been shorn of memory as brutally as she'd been shorn of her hair, without permission, without reason. Opening her eyes, she stared at the floor. Clots of wet hair lay all about: dark hair, light hair, short hair, long hair, and two pale braids. \"Gone, all gone,\" she thought again wildly, no longer even sure what was gone, what she was mourning.\"Hannah, the girl who didn't want to remember the past, has now become Chaya, the girl who cannot remember the future - a future the Nazis are intent on destroying.Jane Yolen has created a powerful story inThe Devil's Arithmetic, one that will draw young readers in, allowing them - through the plot device of a modern child traveling back through time - to experience the terror of the Holocaust in a uniquely intimate way. That it is necessary for them do so - to enter into this strange and horrifying world of the past, and become one with the victims - is borne out, not just by the maxim that \"those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it,\" but by the reality that we are all vulnerable, not just to those forces which might make us victims, but to those which might make us monsters. As Fayge says, at one point, quoting from a story about the Ba'al Shem Tov:\"The enemy will always be with you. He will be in the shadow of your dreams and in your living flesh, for he is the other part of yourself.\"This \"other part\" always needs combating. What better way to do this, than to witness the terrible cruelty and suffering that result, when it is unleashed? So... take a deep breath, grab hold of your courage, fix your eyes on the truth, and plunge into that dark water. It has to be done. Italwayshas to be done. And it always has to be doneagain."

        "user_review": "Yolen employs a \"Magic Tree House\" trope to move her main character, Hannah, a bored American thirteen-year-old at her family's Seder dinner, through time, space and language, and it comes off as hokey. Once Hannah becomes Chaya, an orphan living in a Polish village in 1942, though, this tale grabs onto the reader and doesn't let go. Hannah opens the door of her family's apartment to welcome the prophet Elijah and is soon crammed into a crowded cattle car with other Jews on a train destined for the \"final solution.\" Yolen makes such a narrative more than a recounting of horror and the inhumanity of humanity with strong characters and a strong story. By the time Hannah re-enters the present and pleasant Passover gathering with heightened respect and empathy for her Holocaust-surviving grandfather and aunt, I was willing to forgive the contrived device. After all, it's one that works for kids in any number of series. And in the end, it did so here. The novel prompts young readers swept up in Yolen's carefully researched tale to make the effort to remember what must never be forgotten."

This is aimed at very young readers and so the grisly subject matter must be presented in a way that allows them to read it without ruining their sleep. Having the main character, a modern day, young Jewish girl, living in New Rochelle, transported back in time does this splendidly.My three star review is because I didn't feel the story was written very well after that initial stroke of genius. I must admit that part of this could be that I was expecting a book aimed at teens and this was clearly meant for even younger readers, but I still struggled through after the set up."

        "user_review": "Although there are many Holocaust books out there that are in the young adult genre (Elie Wiesel's Night and The Diary of Anne Frank come to mind), I had not heard of The Devil's Arithmetic until a friend mentioned it.In the novel, Hannah, an American Jewish teenager who is indifferent and apathetic towards her Jewish family's past, is transported back to the 1940s to experience one of the most tragic, painful, and horrific points in history.I felt like this book was an immensely powerful read, one that moves very quickly and one in which the reader can get into the head of the protagonist as she travels back into a dark time in history. As one from the future, Hannah knows all too painfully the horrors that await the Jewish people and those in the concentration camps.The Devil's Arithmetic works and fits into several genres. It is a fantasy in which a young girl must travel back in time to witness and be part of her family's suffering to fully understand and to never forget. But, obviously, the book, while tame in its graphicness, is a very realistic portrayal of such atrocities experienced. And, while the names of the places have been changed, this does not deter from the powerfully realistic images: the awful conditions in the cattle cars, the dehumanization of individuals, the shaving of heads, the separation of loved ones, friends, and families, the lack of necessities like food, water, and proper clothing, the selection of victims.I highlighted a quote in the afterward by the author Jane Yolen that I believe eloquently sums up the entire experience of this book:\"Fiction cannot recite the numbing numbers, but it can be that witness, that memory. A storyteller can attempt to tell the human tale, can make a galaxy out of chaos…\"This point is illustrated in Hannah's physical and emotional journey, and spiritual transformation that she must go through.This edition also contains an extremely helpful glossary for Jewish terms and expressions as well as an afterward by the author.In my opinion, The Devil's Arithmetic is powerful portrayal of a dark time in history, and it is definitely a book for anyone interested in young adult books about the Holocaust."

What a valuable piece of fiction that makes the Holocaust real and understandable for middle grades on up.When you first meet the main character Hannah, she is whiny, resentful, and ignorantly ungrateful. That's typical of many kids though (and some adults!), so I was okay with that as the starting point of her character arc.The setting in the Polish countryside is charming and idyllic, but it doesn't last long. (Someday I want to visit some Eastern European countries. There are a lot of underrated countries over there that people don't typically think of visiting.)The concentration camp is awful, but Yolen mercifully shows the prisoners helping each other alongside the emotional and physical torments of the place. This setting is where you really get acquainted and invested in the various characters, so when the inevitable happens, you feel it.Having said that, the book ends on a good note. Hannah completes her character arc by learning to appreciate her heritage and her family's ways of commemorating it.The Holocaust was an atrocious, evil attempt to exterminate the Jewish people. Sadly, bizarrely, and terrifyingly, some people are now saying that the Holocaust never happened. That kind of revisionist history is exactly what makes books like these so important for people, especially young people, to read."

My teacher suggested this book to me, and I'm happy that she did. I've never, so far, read a book like this in my life. First of all, this was the first Holocaust book I've read. I just love how this book starts and ends, sort of like a circular ending. Most books wont make me shed tears but this one did. I think it was amazing that Hannah the main character, got to go back in time to 1942! It was nice to see things from her perspective. This kept me at the edge of my seat, it was a little scary not knowing what was going to happen next. I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good Holocaust book."

        "user_review": "This book is a big old chunk...and so worth the price of admission.I've never thought of Stephen King as a straight up horror author. He is more than that, he scares the crud out of me with his remarkable ability to look at humanity. He seems to be getting to (for me anyways) to a point in his life where he is debating life and what happens to us after..these stories seem to have that theme to some of them.These stories are mostly stories that have at some time or another been published somewhere else barring a few new ones that he slips in for our pleasure.The best part of this book is not the stories for me though. It's the tidbits that King gives us before each story with a little bit of where the story came from that kept me flipping these pages.I'm just going to barely touch on each story and add where they were published before. There are a lot of stories packed into this bad boy.Mile 81Somewhat of a coming of age story..with a touch of unwordly. (Previously published as an ebook)Jimmy Golding hadn't believed in monster cars since he saw that movie Christine as a kid, but he believed that sometimes monsters could lurk in cars.*4 stars*Premium HarmonyA couple that has been married over ten years arguing over simple life happenings. I'll make sure to pick the pink ball instead. (published in a copy of The New Yorker)*3 stars*Batman and Robin Have an AltercationA son and his father who is suffering from dementia have an outing to a favorite restaurant. They really should come back there sometime. (Harper's Magazine)*4 stars*The DuneAn elderly man makes another trip to a Dune he discovered as a child that has a few secrets left to tell. (Granta)*3.5 stars*Bad Little KidThis was one of my favorites in the book. That kid from Sluggo/Nancy? The mean boy with the propeller hat? He comes to vivid life for one man. (new)*5 stars*A DeathI had already read/reviewed this onehere(The New Yorker)*4 stars*The Bone ChurchI'm not even counting this one because I am not a fan of poetry..not even when it's by Uncle Stevie. (Playboy)*not rating*MoralityWow, just wow. A couple is struggling in a down turned economy. What would you consider sin? And what would you do to pull yourself up out of debt? (Esquire)*5 stars*AfterlifeWhat happens after we die? Is there an afterlife? This one resounded withRevival(Tin House)*3.5 stars*UrThis was that e-book that King did when Amazon first launched the kindle. Fun as far as memories go, I just didn't fawn over it as much as I had hoped too. (e-book)*3 stars*Herman Wouk is Still AliveA down on her luck single mom wins a small lottery win and decides on a road trip with her bestie. (The Atlantic)*4 stars*Under the WeatherA sick wife and her husband's love for her. I can't say much about this one without giving anything away. (Full Dark, No Skies-paperback)*3.5 stars*Blockade BillyA farm boy shows up to serve as a temp catcher in the big leagues. He ends up being the catcher that can stop anything. I'm not even a big baseball fan and this one was one of my favorites in the book. (novella)*5 stars*Mister YummyAnother end of life tale as an elderly man in a nursing home tells his friend that he has been seeing Mr. Yummy. A gorgeous guy that he first saw back when being gay was a dirty little secret. (new)*3.5 stars*TommyAnother poem (Playboy)*not rating*The Little Green God of AgonyA billionaire has been put to bed after a horrible plane crash. His nurse believes that if he tried to work through the pain after the accident that he would be healing faster. (A Book of Horrors)*5 stars*That Bus is Another WorldA quick peep into a passing strangers world as the bus goes by. (Esquire)*3 stars*ObitsA nerdy writer for an internet magazine who writes \"mean\" obits after celebrities die discovers something unique about his column one day after getting angry at his boss. (new)*5 stars*Drunken FireworksA mother and son team of alcoholics take on the Italian CONNECTED neighbors that live across the lake in a many year long battle of the fireworks. (audio book)*4 stars*Summer ThunderA fitting story for the end of the book as the world ends in a nuclear future. (Turn Down the Lights)*3.5 stars*I think I've said before, I'm not usually a fan of short stories. There just is never enough to sink my heart and teeth into with them. I do make exceptions for a few authors and Stephen King will always head that list.Spotlight to come after a few more reviews come in for this one."

One is immediately in the story, the pages start rushing by, nothing stops the flow, everything is understandable, no moment has to be invested to recapitulate and get an overview or think where one actually is and why and everything is just perfectly balanced, as all things should be. I´ve to stop overusing that quote.Plotting vs creative explosionShort stories normally suffer under this problem, the reason why hardly anyone reads them, because why invest time to get into a story when it´s over before the flash kicks in? But with this collection, he once again shows how it´s done, how his intuitively jumping into stories without much planning in the writing process makes the characters feel so vivid and real. There might be some truth around the fact that this authenticity gets lost to a certain extent when plotting any move until perfection.Evolution of a prodigyI´m close to having read anything he ever got published, some stuff twice, and how his short stories and novellas evolved is interesting. I already mentioned once that there are three periods of his work, the young King, the drugged King, and the elder, sober, wiser, sophisticated King. No just joking, he is the same horror master without any stupid attitude towards higher culture snob bad Nobel price unworthy garbage writing, just one of the best authors of all time.From imitating grandmasters to finding his own styleWhen he was young there was strong influence by the writers he mentions very often, so the works are more first half and middle of the 20th-century style than typical for the time they were published, and they are more dealing with the greater horror, Lovecraftian influence, and with passages similar to the epic writing of Bradbury. When drugged, he wrote between ingenious and average. It´s difficult to point the finger at the differences to the other periods, but it´s no good advertisement for the anti-drug and abstinence movements that he wrote some of his greatest works (Different Seasons, Misery) when he a was an alcoholic, totally multi substance permanent wasted, and finally both.From paranormal horror to psychological terrorThis book is the calm, perfect storytelling of a prodigy who has achieved anything possible in his subject, a celebration of creativity that shows that the smallest idea can be turned into a great story. It also shows that King, in the autumn of his life, is more and more dealing with death, ethics, the afterlife, morality, what a good life is, and topics he didn´t put so much focus on in the past when he mostly wrote pure physical and psychological horror.The stories may vary a bit in quality, logic, and consistency, but there is nothing I wouldn´t call average ( I am biased as heck) and some are truly ingenious.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "**4.5-stars rounded up**The Bazaar of Bad Dreamsis a superb short-story collection that I loved reading. Honestly though, was I surprised?Included are 20-short stories that span a wide gamut of topics and provide plenty of food for thought.I really enjoyed how varied the stories were. Going from one to the next, I was always surprised with where we ended up.I found it to be unpredictable in the best way. One moment you are reading about savage cars, the next, names written in the sand, dueling fireworks shows, all the way to the literal end.My favorite aspect of this book, however, was the short introductions, where King would give insight into his inspirations, or personal connections to each story.Those sections really helped to set the tone going into each one and for me, I think I took a lot more away because of that.I highly recommend this collection, particularly if you are already a King fan and are familiar with his style and humor.Even if you are new to King, however, I think you will really enjoy this one. It's just a darn good time!"

        "user_review": "Hey, it's a collection of Stephen King stories out just in time for….Thanksgiving? Really, Scribner? You had a book from the master of modern horror in your pipeline and decided to release it three daysafterHalloween? I'm no marketing guru, but I think this may be a clue as to why the publishing industry is struggling so much these days.On to the review...Any long time Stephen King fan should be willing to admit that the man can shit the bed every once in awhile, and when he writes a real clunker of a novel then you're stuck with that bad taste in your mouth until the next, hopefully better, one comes out. The great thing about reading a bunch of short stories from Uncle Stevie is that even when there's a turd in the punch bowl you can just roll into the next one immediately and usually find something much better.That's pretty much the case here in which the mixed bag of stories range from King at his wonky worst to some really strong character pieces on serious topics like aging, poverty, and morality. So while I might have been rolling my eyes at the ending ofMile 81or the general goofiness of the villain inBad Little Kidthe mood only lasted until I hit one of the better ones likeAfterlifeorHerman Wouk Is Still Alive.A lot of the stories have echoes to other King works.Urhas a link toThe Dark Towerseries as well as more than a passing resemblance to11/22/63. The evil car concept inMile 81is something else he's done before inChristineandTrucks, and there's a lot ofFrom A Buick 8in there.Obitsshares some DNA with theEverything's Eventualshort story, too.But King has been doing this a long, long time so coming up with something totally new is like askingThe Simpsonsto find a job that Homer hasn't already held. Mostly these are comforting echoes with enough upgrades and twists that you still feel like you're getting something new in the guise of the familiar.Overall, it's a solid collection, and there are as surprising number of stories with no supernatural elements. That may disappoint some King fans, but I found those to be the best ones."

        "user_review": "Twenty Stephen King shorts, some new, some published elsewhere. When you open a King short story collection, there's an expectation of some all-out horror, maybe some suspense or mystery and a few references to the wider King universe. Each story was prefaced by a personal note or anecdote about the story or the telling of the story.It's not that this collection is particularly poor or week, it's just that King has set himself high standards with so many amazing short stories, I found it difficult to really appreciate this collection. Despite a preponderance of just \"good\" shorts, two really stood out for me, first \"Batman and Robin Have An Altercation\" a wonderful tale about a father, a son and Alzheimer's! The second big-gun was \"Herman Wouk Is Still Alive\" where an older couple witness a horrific accident... can I hear old-school King? So many of these stories were set on great concepts and read well, but the endings were often unfulfilling or predictable. I suppose I am a big fan of the final page pay-off for short stories which this certainly lacked. Good book, but nothing special 7 out of 12.[image error]2020 read"

        "user_review": "Not exactly a thrilling collection is The Bazaar of Bad Dreams.One of the main reasons why is because I have purchased a couple of these stories already, for $3.00 or $4.00, each. (UR and Mile 81, I'm looking at you.) I think it really sucks to be asked to pay for these again, along with a bunch of other stories that were already published elsewhere.Aside from that gripe, I also wasn't impressed with the stories themselves. Yes, it's disappointing that most of them were not horror, but I'm okay with that. It's just- it's also disappointing that the stories were not all that good. I loved The Little Green God of Agony and a couple of the others, but not enough to make reading this entire collection worth the time or money.I hate to say these things, because I love the King and have said in the past I would be happy to read his grocery list, but I guess now I'm rethinking even that. I'm bummed."

        "user_review": "I figure I'd better put a bit of effort into this review, so rather than just throwing out a few impressions from just a few of the stories, I'll throw out impressions for ALL the stories. :) Stephen King is still a POWER in the world, for good and ill, and more importantly, he's a damn great writer. I don't care too much for short stories in general, but I do tend to enjoy them when I finally get my arm twisted.Overall impression: SK's characterizations are King. Memorable, conflicted, and above all, deeply interesting. You know the old adage, \"Kill your darlings?\" Yeah. He's a master at it.Mile 81 -Truly gorgeous characters, especially the ones that died in horrible and grotesque ways. I sit in awe at SK's ability to evoke the feels and connect us to his people right before we wonder if they'll survive. I kinda expected a Christine-ish story, but this was pretty near perfect as it was. Awesome. Kids rock.Premium Harmony -Carver-like story with deep characterization, immediacy, and sudden death. Quite beautiful.Batman and Robin Have An Altercation-Well crafted story of road rage, but it didn't really grab me quite as much as the others. It was mostly nostalgia and a brief moment of terror.The Dune -A bit magical, a bit odd. A bit forgettable.Bad Little Kid -Fascinating characters and creepy coincidences and a very cool build. Smooth as silk. Some kids DON'T rock.A Death -An old-tyme lynching... or is it a murder mystery? Kill-em kill-em anyway!Bone Church -A meh poem.Morality -Back to interesting characters and a rather hardcore fall from optimism to abject pessimism, including some rather memorable obsessions. It was like watching a train wreck. The ending also turned my stomach, but not for the usual horror-type reasons. It was an indictment of beliefs. Odd and disturbing tale.Afterlife -Let's get away from this mortal coil, eh? Nothing changes if you go back. All your same mistakes to do over and over... or you could choose utter oblivion. No one is sinless, and the best part is the... you guessed it... the characters. I actually liked the societal preachiness. :)Ur -Back to some cool horror and character development, featuring everyone's favorite Pink Kindle! Fuck the One Ring... this one's EVIL. ;) And yet, I found myself looking up the new models of Kindle and dreaming... and yeah, this story is a Dark Tower tie in. That part made it AWESOME.Herman Wouk is Still Alive -Pretty Classic King. Fall in love with the characters only to be shown how ephemeral they are while simultaneously immortalizing them quite consciously.Under the Weather -Damn uplifting story about someone who keeps things around well after their \"Best Fresh Date\". It's both sad and creepy as hell, too, but mostly very optimistic.Blockade Billy -Even as SK warns us that we don't have to like a particular pastime to enjoy a good story about it, I still don't care much for baseball yarns. Or any sports, for that matter. Still, I kept with it and by the end kinda wished I was given a \"Bad News Bears\" story with SK's twist from this little gem. Uplifting, quirky, full of hope in the middle of despair, and in the end... the fat kid we had been rooting for all along actually wound-up being six-year-old Michael Myers. And have the movie be billed as something meant for kids, too. Does that make me sick? MuahahaMister Yummy -This was an oddball. I know there's a lot of magical realism meets retirement home stories out there, and SK likes to corner the field, but running to back to flashback the 50's and eighties as a wild gay man rummaging about Aids, who eventually winds up being one of the top 1% and an ultraconservative in his old age just tells me that way too many authors out there just aren't trying hard enough. Rock on.Tommy -Nostalgia poem. 'S ok. Kinda had to be there.That Little Green God Of Agony -A story about pain management done SK style. A lot of old tropes done with style and nice twists. SK hasn't lost his talent. Indeed, he's been sharpening his blades all along. Now, let's get that sucker out!The Bus Is Another World -Kinda thought this would be a great fantasy title, but no, it was more of a story about tight distraction. Do we all filter things that happen this much? \"Murder? Oh well... I've got A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING....\" The thing is, the character is so interesting that I sympathize. What does that make me? (Hint: that's likely the point.)Obits -Probably one of my most favorite stories in this collection. ThinkDeath Note, Vol. 1: Boredomwith a rather less tight rule system attached to it. Very creepy and rather effective. I'd probably give everything up and move to Wyoming, too.Drunken Fireworks -As a plain short story without anything supernatural, it was a fun drunken ride. Hatfields and McCoys with fireworks. :) Good *somewhat clean* fun.Summer Thunder -SF apocalypse, as only SK can do it. Definitely a more concise tale thanThe Stand, but this time with a nuclear option. I loved Gandalf, and watching that progression really broke my heart. SK proves that it's only the close-up that matters. *sigh*"

        "user_review": "For some authors, creating a large body of work doesn't mean quality has to suffer. Unfortunately, there are readers and critics who make exactly that assumption. As a result, when you're as prolific as Stephen King, you're prone to the following dangers:--Folks using verbs like \"spewing,\" \"spitting,\" \"cranking out,\" or \"vomiting\" in reference to the frequency with which you're published.--More books mean more opportunities for criticism. In that vein, many readers tend to forget ten great experiences with an author and fixate on a few bad ones and proclaim, \"That's it! I'm done with him!\" If an artist takes the James Cameron route of creating something new every five or six years, there are fewer opportunities for fans to repudiate him. King affords himself no such luxury. He keeps \"cranking them out,\" which means he receives all the exasperation and faint praise associated with being prolific.--The notion that you're somehow \"grandstanding,\" and that the author who gazes moodily into the distance for six months without typing a single word is somehow more serious about his or her craft.When you keep all this in mind, you begin to understand that for an artist who cares, producing work prolifically is actually a sign of great courage. And—though this should go without saying—the product of a stalwart work ethic. Stephen King refuses to coast on the reputation of his considerable body of work, and what's more, he refuses to stop growing.If I had penny for every time I heard someone swearing off Stephen King because (Insert Title Here sucked), I'd have enough money to buy a masterpiece like THE BAZAAR OF BAD DREAMS.And it is a masterpiece, friends.You see, those who fell off the King Fan Wagon back in '83 or '96 or '09 are probably perfectly happy reading other authors, and I'm the last person to condemn someone else's taste.But in this author's humble opinion, those who've forsaken or have not been reading King are missing some of the best work of his career.I don't know if King has ever been better at crafting stories than he is now. For proof, just look at a few of the delights included in these pages:\"Ur,\" a surprisingly old-fashioned tale where you root for the good guys and fear the hand of Fate.\"Bad Little Kid,\" a nasty little chiller that had me avoiding windows in the fear I'd discover the sinister child staring back at me.\"Morality,\" a story that shook me with its casual monstrousness and its eerie plausibility. I wish I could forget it, but I can't.\"A Death,\" which left me stunned and a bit abashed because of the way I'd so thoroughly identified with the protagonist lawman.\"Summer Thunder,\" one of the best apocalyptic tales I've ever read, and certainly one of the saddest. My God, I hope we never suffer a nuclear holocaust.\"Cookie Jar,\" a yarn that moved me to tears and reminded me forcibly of my grandfather.\"Batman and Robin Have an Altercation,\" which veered into territory I did not expect and featured a perfect ending.And \"Drunken Fireworks,\" the sort of hilariously wild throwdown only King could pull off.For those of you still reading King--for you Constant Readers--you've already experienced these stories or you someday will. You know exactly what a gift Stephen King is.For the rest of you? There are many authors in the world, and I hope you find one who brings you the same kind of happiness Stephen King brings me.Long days and pleasant nights to you all."

        "user_review": "Guys, this collection is on sale for Kindle for only $2.99 right now. If you haven't read it yet, you can grab ithere.*********************************************I waited so, so long for this book, and while I cannot say I disliked it, I do feel that it wasn't as strong as some of Mr. King's other collections. There were some stories here Iloved, and some that, as some of Mr. King's more colorful characters might say, \"Sucked the big one.\" I don't want to bog you down in Reviewland, so I'll just give a sentence or two for each, and an individual rating. It may or may not average out to four stars, but I'm giving it one for the cover. Sue me.Mile 81 - Yeah, no. This one dragged on too long by at least two devourings. Two stars, max.Premium Harmony - ....not sure if I was meant to be scared or horrified or grossed out by this. I do have to say that I felt more for the dog than Mary. Does that make me a bad person? Three stars.Batman and Robin Have an Altercation - This one was great. Extra love for the ending. Five stars.The Dune - Glimmers ofDuma Key. Liked but not loved. Characters not what I expect from King - too flat. Three stars.Bad Little Kid - I actually liked this one a lot. Would've liked a better explanation on the transfer of the bad juju, but still. Four stars.A Death - Very DT vibe to this one, without the fantasy aspect to the Westernishness. (No, that is not a word. I acknowledge that freely.) Four stars.The Bone Church - I hate narrative poetry. Ew. This could have been fantastic as prose. One star.Morality - Riveting and with fascinating characters. Four stars.Afterlife - What a completely horrifying view of what happens when we die. Like a not funny but terrifyingGroundhog Day. Four stars.Ur - Another appearance by my least favorite King baddies. They sucked inHearts in Atlantis, they sucked inThe Dark Towerseries, and they suck here.And whoever heard of a King short with a happy ending? Was he on happy gas when he wrote this?Two stars.Herman Wouk Is Still Alive - Not a fan of this one much. I think Brenda and Jasmine are caricatures of clichés of drunken fat moms. Shame on this story. One star.Under the Weather - OMG the creep factor of this one. Undiminished by guessing the ending. Five stars.Blockade Billy - I don't care if this was about baseball. It wasn'tjustabout baseball, and I loved it. Five stars.Mister Yummy - Weird, and not in a great way. Three stars.Tommy - UGH. Shades of Allen Ginsberg. Please, no. One star.The Little Green God of Agony - Very creepy and well characterized. \"Monster\" a little weird, but did like the ending. Four stars.That Bus Is Another World - Sometimes neurotic MCs work, sometimes they don't. I didn't like this one very much. Two stars.Obits - This one had a refreshingly original premise, and (despite warnings to the contrary) I thought the ending worked well. Four stars.Drunken Fireworks - Meh. Reminded me ofDelores Claiborne, but with none of DC's compelling characterizations and horror. Three stars.Summer Thunder - Cannot compete withThe Stand, obviously, since it's not 89879349871234098143 pages long, but a horrifying mini-apocalypse just the same.Does SK have a dog named Gandalf? Or, more likely,hatea dog named Gandalf? This is the second time he's killed off a dog with that moniker.See alsoDuma Key.Four stars.TL;DR: Read this for the high points, but expect some low ones, as must be with any short story collection. You'll enjoy some of them, at least, because there's something for everyone here. Truly a bazaar.**************************************OMG OMG OMG IT'S IN THE MAIL IT WILL BE HERE SOON*breathes into paper bagOkay. I'm okay. It's cool.**************************************OMG I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T EVENICAN'TEVENGASPGimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimmegimme"

        "user_review": "This review is for the short story \"A Death\" by Stephen King, set in the old West. It's free onlinehere, courtesy of The New Yorker magazine.A young girl is murdered; her silver dollar, a birthday present, stolen.Jim Trusdale's hat is found under her body, but the dollar is nowhere to be found. In Jim's simple-minded way, he protests his innocence more and more vehemently as he is arrested and put on trial. But his fate, in the form of incensed and vengeful townspeople, is quickly closing in on him.\"I don't want to ride in no funeral hack,\" Trusdale said. \"That's bad luck.\"\"You got bad luck all over,\" one of the men said. \"You're painted in it. Get in.\"The prosecutor and the judge are the same man, and the townspeople build the gallows to hang Jim while the trial is still going on. Only the sheriff begins to doubt Jim's guilt . . .This is a bit of a slight tale, and probably wouldn't get much attention if it weren't for the fact that King wrote it. But it's only a ten-minute read, maybe, and it's an online freebie. And it sucked me in: I kept reading faster and faster, getting more and more worried about where this was headed. The spare prose King uses here fits the genre well.3.75 stars. Give this a read if you're a fan of King, or westerns, or murder mysteries, or short stories generally. I for one didn't guess the ending.Thanks to Kelly and Shelby for bringing this story to my attention!"

Check out my story by story reviews below.Mile 81 - 4 stars - I read this when it first came out by itself. Unique and creepy - I like when King writes about monster cars. I didn't care for the resolution - too quick and convenient. But, still a good StoryPremium Harmony - 2.5 Stars - Just a couple of hours in Ray's life with some seriously unfortunate developments - nothing too exciting. Not really a beginning, or a climax, or an end.Batman and Robin Have an Altercation - 5 Stars -Fantastic little story - we get to know the characters fast and there is an unexpectedly touching (and gruesome) twist. And, I found the twist satisfying!The Dune - 4.5 Stars - Dark, twisted, mysterious - just when you think you know where the story is headed, King gives you a bit of a shock and a wink.Bad Little Kid - 4 Stars - Another creepy revenge story. In places, almost silly - but it wouldn't be silly if it was happening to you!\"A Death - 3 Stars I enjoyed the Western theme, the writing, and the majority of the story. Only three stars because the Western stuff was so cool, but it just kind of ended blah and I wanted moreThe Bone Church - 3 Stars - A poem - some cool imagery and a dark, gruesome story. Very quick read.Morality - 4 Stars - Partway through, I realized I had read this before. It is interesting to ponder what sort of darkness we have in side of us, what would it take to unleash it, and how far would we be willing to go?Afterlife - 5 Stars - I really enjoyed this interpretation of what might be waiting for us when we die. I also like that it is another tough \"what would you do?\" situation (King likes to do those).Ur - 5 Stars - This was a re-read for me. Great story with a unique concept. I am reading this on a Kindle - which seems appropriate. Which author would you look for if you had the parallel universe Kindle?Herman Wouk Is Still Alive - 3 Stars - Interesting idea for a story, but the narrative felt forced. It was like King knew what he wanted to say, but not quite how to say it.Under the Weather - 4 Stars - King mentions in the intro that you can kind of see where this one is headed the whole time, and that's true - but, it doesn't ruin the dark goodness of the story.Blockade Billy - 5 Stars - This was the second time I read this - I will have to go back and check what I gave it last time I read it, but it was 5 stars this time. I love a good baseball story and I love King's dark twist. Also, the historical fiction aspect of it is nice.Mister Yummy - 4 Stars - King touches on the boundary between life and afterlife again. This one is very unique.Tommy - 4.5 Stars - I thought this was a really cool little poem. Makes you think about the fact that who we are when we die is who we are to the rest of the world forever.The Little Green God of Agony - 4 Stars - Bizarre and dark. Lots left for the reader to conjecture. What is pain?That Bus Is Another World - 4 Stars - A little existential journey about our encounters with others and how involved we would willing to be in other people's worlds. King is really hitting the \"What would you do?\" with this story collection.Obits - 5 Stars - unique and creepy idea! Also, King mentions the town I grew up in and the place where I learned to downhill ski - so bonus points!Drunken Fireworks - 4.5 Stars - A comedy, and I did LOL a few times. It reminded me of my last two 4th of Julys on a lake in rural Indiana.Summer Thunder – 3.5 Stars – Melancholy, hopeless, and nostalgic; a pretty decent (but certainly not uplifting) way to end the collection"

I don't really care about the stupidity of some of the people, lol, I just love the whole idea!NEXTI liked this one because the son goes and gets his dad each week to go out to eat, his dad is slowly losing his memory. They have a really nice time eating, but then something happens on the way back to the nursing home and it was just so cool what ole pops did when he knew his son was in trouble. And after all was said and done, pops just goes back to talking about something he remembers years ago :-)AND LAST ON MY LISTI really wanted someone to end this bad little kid, but this little kid is not what he seems, like you didn't figure that out! What would you do if you have an evil little person following you all of your days.....I very much enjoyed the book, there were a few I didn't care for but most of them, even the little stories I thought were good because they were really a bad dream for that person dealing with it.Kudos, Mr. King! :-)"

        "user_review": "I have to say,The Bazaarfrom Uncle Steve was a bit of a letdown. Stephen King is, obviously, one of the most-hyped authors of today, which is why the fall from so high can be so hard for his readers. This collection of previously published works, in itself, had a range like open arms – from eye-roll-warranting clunkers that never took off and seemed rather (dare I say it?) juvenile for such a master wordsmith to others that truly took my breath away and really explored the mental and emotional crevices of humanity in a way that was breathtakingly clear and surprising – similar to reaching the summit of a huge roller coaster and seeing the landscape around you for those vivid two seconds before being dragged back down again. \"Blockade Billy\", \"Bad Little Kid\" and \"Under the Weather\", I'm looking at you now.Overall, I will remember this collection as a hodgepodge that had some really great highlights – and those highlights are what I will take from it. The short introductions to each story were a real treat. Those anecdotes and revelations were the extra seasoning that this collection needed to thread it all together. However, it would've been cool if the original place of publication had been added to those intro snippets; after all, we all knew that most of them were previously published anyway.Mile 81 –This story was surprisingly and glaringly amateur. I appreciate that he led us into that with the knowledge that it was one of his earliest works, but it left an awful taste in my mouth and a hesitation to continue on with the collection. Not the best choice for starting out; better to bury that one somewhere in the middle. No stars.Premium Harmony –Deliciously dry and sardonic. The dialogue hit the nail on the head in that matter-of-fact sort of way that makes you laugh out loud, and the title – fittingly ironic indeed – tied the humor and storyline all together. Great story! **** 4 starsBatman and Robin Have an Altercation –The father-son storyline warmed the heart, but there wasn't much else here. * 1 starThe Dune –This story had a setting and cadence that really made the story, but this one would've been more compelling if it had showcased action scenes (which King definitely seems to have shied away from in this collection on a whole). At minimum, it would have carried more resonance if the narrator hadn't described the deaths in such a half-removed-from-the-situation fashion. Nonetheless, the voice and pace were very steady and controlled, allowing me to trust both the author's hand and the narrator's voice. **** 4 starsBad Little Kid –Awesome story! Sinister, slow and, at times, somber, but never too much. It was a true King story for his avid readers, his hand for the disturbing on full display here. ***** 5 starsA Death –A great \"period\" piece mixed with a little \"local color\" – sorry King, I know you have \"no use for that.\" This one was an excellent example of how dialogue and regional slang can really set the scene and shape a work! **** 4 starsThe Bone Church –I'm all for contemporary poetry that doesn't follow the rules, but the two poetry selections presented here proved that I am not a fan of King's attempts at that particular form of art. Disjointed and confusing, this one gets no stars.Morality –This story was very well written, but anti-climactic for sure, particularly the ending. Sure – it was a real-world sort of ending, but it didn't live up to the hype at all, and the \"crime\" that was so central to the story's theme was so minor, I couldn't believe all the hyperventilation they were doing over it! Good story telling, but not much there to sink my teeth into. ** 2.5 starsAfterlife –This story had a biting humor, juxtaposed by the two main characters' past interactions with women, that added a new an unexpected layer to this story. The 50s setting and various decades referenced as they discuss the mistakes of their past gave this one body and made it more memorable and 3-D. Good story. *** 3.5 starsUr –UGH! This story was great for the sort of Super Bowl celebrity selling out that we expect to see in commercials, but this one SERIOUSLY took away a lot of King's street cred! Great for Kindle/Amazon propaganda, but an otherwise ridiculous attempt with a cop-out, oh-this-story-is-getting-to-be-way-to-long-so-let's-just-end-it-now sort of finale. Definitely warranted more than a few eye rolls. One star for referencing the cool possibility of authors writing new and previously unexplored works in other dimensions, but that's about it. * 1 starHerman Wouk Is Still Alive –I LOVED the blunt and unornamented examination of life that this one provided. It was so real, in fact, that it was almost pure. This look at real life aimed for the authentic and came from a character's POV who was really examining it all for the first time. Thought-provoking and funny, this one was a winner. The story would've really hit the mark if it hadn't been watered down by the elderly couple's POV. **** 4 starsUnder the Weather –AWESOME story; definitely one of the best of the bunch! I felt a nod to \"A Rose for Emily\" in this one that I loved; it was macabre in a delectable way that resonated loudly at the end. It had all of the elements of a good short story and a King-worthy ending. The thread about the dream really tied this one together. ***** easily 5 starsBlockade Billy –This one was another long one, but I truly did not mind it being long at all! The jargon here was thick as molasses, which I didn't always get, but it didn't take away from the story; in a lot of ways, it made the story. I felt like I was a part of their world, which is the whole reason that people read when they could just watch a movie. The ending was KILLLER. Really. Killer. ***** easily 5 starsMr. Yummy –This one didn't live up to the intro that King wrote for it; it was neither about desire nor AIDS (for that matter), which made it a bit of a letdown. The irony and humor of the \"grim reaper\" aspect made the story unique, but this one seemed like a failed attempt overall because those topics were just mentioned in passing, not really explored as the intro seemed to promise. *** 3 starsTommy –No comment is comment enough. Not a fan of Uncle Stevie's poetry in this collection.The Little Green God of Agony –Umm, not a winner for me. This was like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps on steroids (mild steroids that made it appropriate for an adult, not extreme steroids that made it King-like). Enough said. ** 2 stars for the humor added by the nurse's thoughts and the dynamic between she and her boss.That Bus Is Another World –Good little short with a surprise ending. I'll tip a nod here to King for putting his characteristic examination of humanity into this one. *** 3 starsObits –Didn't live up to the phenomenal story I thought I was getting (because of its length and premise highlighted on the jacket flap). You'd think that only the best stories would be highlighted there, but, in my opinion, the opposite happened. This one also veered towards juvenile at times and the ending was…whhhhaaaaat?... a letdown for sure. ** 2.5 stars for the premiseDrunken Fireworks –This one had absolutely nothing to do with horror or even the vaguely macabre. Though King shared his distaste for the term, this one was definitely just an episode of \"local color,\" which is likely why he felt the need to defend against that. ** 2 starsSummer Thunder –Sure, what better way to end the collection than with the apocalypse, I agree. This, however, showed again how King didn't jump in to tackle the big action scenes but settled for examining the aftermath, or 3rd person removed version of them. Other than that, it was a solid story, worthy of the King brand, with an ending that was foreshadowed but…comme si comme ça.FOLLOW ME HERE:Art + Deco Agency Book Blog|Twitter|Instagram|Art + Deco Publishing Agency"

        "user_review": "Another fine story in Bazaar of Bad Dreams. In this book Stephen King is exploring life after death and what happens. This seems to be Stephen's own take on it and it still leaves a huge mystery open and it is a little sad at the same time.I found this story wonderful and I don't want to spoil any of it. We do follow one man after he dies of cancer and we find out that he is in a place. He must make a choice in this place. We see several moments of the life the man lead. Bill is the man.With all the stuff about the afterlife, how can an author come up with something original, but I feel STephen has done that. At least, I haven't seen anything like this.Worth a read and it's a short, short-story.Merged review:One more Stephen King book read. I have 5 more books left to read. These were a good group of short stories, many genres and subjects. There are some good supernatural stories in here and then some every day people going through drama and 2 poems King wrote.Some of the ones that stood out to me as my favorite were: Mile 81 (best), Bad Little Kid, Afterlife, Ur, Under the Weather, Little Green God of Agony, Obits, Drunken Fireworks and Summer Thunder. The others were good stories, and a few only okay stories. Mile 81 was just what I needed from this collection and it starts the book off right.All the blurbs and Schribner are trying to sell this book as a horror book, but many of the stories are anything but. Several of them are simply dramas with normal people. They sell King hard on being horror and thats great, but you get a bit of everything here. I thought it was perfect for spooky season. It wasn't too scary, but there was enough spine chilling going on to be enough for me now.I think these collections will be good to go back and read only the stories that were good for me and leave the others to time. The good ones balance out the others. The ones I enjoyed most had the supernatural piece of the story.Here is a list of all the stories in the collection:Mile 81;Premium Harmony;Batman and Robin have an Altercation;The Dune;Bad LIttle Kid;A Death;The Bone Church;Morality;Afterlife;Ur;Herman Wouk is Still Alive;Under the Weather;Blockade Billy;Mister Yummy;Tommy;The Little Green God of Agony;That Bus is Another World;Obits;Drunken Fireworks;SUmmer Thunder"

        "user_review": "Here's to the only book I read this September, because I'm not considering \"The Grownup\" by Gillian Flynn as a novel read this month. I'm already lagging way behind on my reading goal but it's fine. I've come to realize that I seriously don't have time to read anymore nowadays. It's annoying when I choose a bad novel because I stop at some point and feel that a huge amount of my time has been wasted. I'm really glad that this collection of short stories made me feel fulfilled. I enjoyed most of the stories, and I really loved some of them. This is the thing with Stephen King, he can make me enjoy things that I normally don't (short stories), but there's one thing that he didn't change, and that's my dislike of poetry. I ended up skipping \"The Bone Church\" entirely because I really don't like reading poetry, at all. Ironic how I used to write a couple of them when I was younger, but these days I try my best to avoid it. I know plenty of people enjoy the genre, and that's good for you. It's just unfortunate that I can't seem to grasp the essence of poetry itself nowadays. I'm hoping this would change in the future though.Just like the last collection of short stories I've read, I'm not going to do an in depth review of every story. I'm just going to talk about the three stories that I enjoyed a lot, considering I gave this a 4-star rating.UrI know how used up this idea is to this date, but King can make anything feel new and entertaining. He added in a new element known as the revolution to ebooks. It's a topic that's been fought over a lot in the internet. There should be no clear winner considering it all boils down to personal preference. I myself love the real thing, but I don't hate my iPad especially when I read in public. It's way easier because my bag weighs a lot lighter with just my iPad Mini rather than a heavy ass hardback. King incorporated a recent issue to a post-apocalyptic theme. It's not just the topic that made me enjoy this a lot, but also the characters. They did seem genuine about every emotion they exude. It's obviously not forced, and it's written the best way possible. The pacing is perfect, and the climax happens just at the right time.The DuneThe beauty of a collection of short stories is that you have no idea what each story is about. In the case of The Dune, it was a terrific surprise for me. This is one of the many fast reads of this collection. I remember reading this around 1 am and even though I was already sleepy and needed to wake up in about 5 hours, I still finished this, and I was wide awake after reading it. It's a simple story but the execution is remarkable. It's one of those slap at the face ending, but it's a good slap. It's a slap for not seeing what happens in the end.AfterlifeThis is also one of those stories that will be stuck with you for a very long time. It's an amazing concept of what could happen in the afterlife. I'm quite scared that Stevie King is talking about the afterlife more nowadays, but it's fine. I'm just taking it in as added substance to this work. I want to go full on in depth reviewer over this, but it's a short story. The moment I go berserk mode on this, I will spoil you guys. Just buy the damn book and read this, and comment below if you disagree about it being amazing. I would love to know why, because I see no flaw in this. One of King's best work to date.ObitsThis is my favorite of all the stories here. It's everything that makes it amazing. The characters, the plot, the writing, the pacing, everything. The messed up characters makes this short story a lot better than it already is. The main character works as an obituary writer on an infamous website. He doesn't really enjoy what he does but he doesn't have much choice considering he studied journalism and doesn't seem to want to try the bigger online publishing sites. One day he decides to write an obituary of his coworker, who is still alive. He was pissed and tired from everything so out of a whim he decides to write one. What happens next brings nothing but catastrophe in his life.That's all I can say about this without spoiling. It's an amazing piece of work by King, and I can't believe that this is just a short story. I wanted more after reading it, and quite frankly I still want more right now. This is the one that really stuck by me up to now. I know I won't find anything as good as this out there in the book world. It's caused a bit of a book hangover, but just a bit, considering it's just a short story.The stories such asMortality,Premium Harmony, andDrunken Fireworksare also really amazing. I don't want to do a review of them anymore because where is the joy in the possibility of spoiling, plus I don't want to prolong a review that needs to be straight to the point to begin with.I need to note the bad ones though, so beware of these rotten things:-The Bone Church (I aleady mentioned why)-Blockade Billy (this is the WORST one in this collection)-Mister Yummy4.5/5 stars, Rounded down because some of the stories are forgettable and I did hate three of them. The ones that I mentioned above and did the best \"in depth\" review of obviously received 5 stars and made me rethink the rounded down decision I made. This is one of King's latest work, and this just proves that he is still amazing at what he does. All I can say is read the damn book already."

        "user_review": "REVIEW of A DEATH SHORT STORY NOT OF THE WHOLE COLLECTION.Wow. This is my introduction to Mr. King and I have to say I am impressed. Until a few months ago, I only knew he wrote horror books. Then I found out he wrote also fantasy, mystery and stories (The Shawshank Redemption !!!). Many reviews that I read said that he was a very good storyteller so it got me curios.I found this story a while back in the New Yorker and I thought I would be a good occasion to find out what this much admired author is about. I did not have big expectations as I am not easily touched by short stories but I was engrossed by this one. He manages to build clear characters and tension in just a few pages. He succeeded to control my thoughts to make a certain opinion about the direction the story was going and then he slapped me with the ending.The story convinced me to read one of his books. The only problem is that I do not know which one. The size of many of his books scare me and I do not want to choose the wrong one. Any suggestion with what should I start is welcomed!!!The link where to read the free story is :http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201..."

        "user_review": "If you're looking for a great collection of short stories by a legendary author, look no further than The Bazaar of Bad Dreams by Stephen King! It has a ton of short stories written by King that checks all the boxes and hits you with different kinds of genres in writing, all of which are brilliantly done.I especially enjoyed how before each short story, King breaks down the thought process of what inspired him to write it. As you continue reading throughout the book, you start to see how a lot of these great stories, and even in general, all of King's outstanding work over the decades, just hit him naturally before he writes magic.This is 5/5 stars in my book and then some, it's that good and something I highly recommend for any fellow fans of King, especially if you also love the horror, suspense, and thriller genres. This is a must-have if you're new to King's work and want to get a good sample size before jumping into his classics (The Shining, It, Salem's Lot, If It Bleeds, etc.) that people will recommend you read at least once in your life. It's a great sample size of one of the best authors of all-time!"

Not a single clinker in the batch, but as always, some with more of a bite than the others.If you are one of those individuals who continues to drag your feet about getting an e-reader, you may have been right all along.URcertainly suggests it. This one was full of tasty Easter eggs, and speaks to the Paradox Law.Moralityis one of the yarns with embedded teeth. Disturbing.Inside these pages you will come across an insomniac with the ironic name of Mrs. Reston, a sandbar like no other, a creepy abandoned rest stop, a bad little kid who sports one of those horrible beanie caps with the propeller on top, a remembrance of a Halloween from long ago.Each offering is prefaced with a short word from Stephen King telling of how the idea of the story came to him. Thoroughly enjoyed every one of these little look-sees into his creative mind."

        "user_review": "3.5Uno de los mejores libros de relatos que ha escrito King. Superior aJust After Sunset,Everything's Eventual,Nightmares & Dreamscapes, y le llega a los talones al insuperable —al menos por ahora—Night Shift. Cuentos muy sólidos y maduros que, al menos a mí, lograron atraparme entre sus redes. Hace mucho que no leía una antología de este autor que me gustara tanto; no soy muy fanático de este tipo de obras.Desde historias conmovedoras que muestran la cara más sentimental de King hasta otras que son tan perturbadoras que recomiendo leerlas de día,The Bazaar of Bad Dreamsse ha posicionado como un libro intenso y tormentoso de principio a fin.Algo que debo mencionar es que King explica de dónde salieron las ideas para cada relato. Eso me encantó. Me hizo sentir más cerca de él. Como si me estuviese contando un secreto.Estos son los trabajos presentes:Mile 81: Hace rato que tenía ganas de leer este cuento. Había leído críticas muy buenas de él. Y no me decepcionó. Desde el inicio estuve a merced de lo que iba ocurriendo en la historia. Es algo repetitivo en la mitad y por eso se me hizo un poco pesado, sin embargo, el entretenimiento está asegurado. (3.5/5)Premium Harmony: Este es uno de mis favoritos. Es una pequeña muestra de lo cruel que puede llegar a ser la vida. Relato corto pero que hiere con un final que desborda de miseria. (3.5/5)Batman and Robin Have an Altercation: No me gustó tanto como los anteriores. No le vi nada de especial. Es entretenido, un poco tierno y con un buen cierre, no obstante, no logró causarme nada. Definitivamente esperaba algo distinto. (2.5/5)The Dune: Buen relato. No es de los mejores ya que tiene demasiado relleno. Se lee rápido y que trate la publicidad fue un ingrediente que me hizo aumentarle la puntuación, puesto que, al yo estudiar eso, ese relleno me resultó interesante. (3/5)Bad Little Kid: Otro de mis favoritos. Se podría decir que es una novela corta. Es de los más oscuros del libro. Lo negativo es que tiene una conclusión muy predecible. Se veía venir desde casi la primera página. (4/5)A Death: Ameno, agradable, con un comienzo que me atrapó en el acto. Lamentablemente, una vez más me encontré con una terminación que veía a kilómetros de distancia. Aunque eso no quiere decir que no lo recomiende. Un cuento de misterio psicológico. (3/5)The Bone Church: Es un poema que no disfruté. Este sí tiene un gran final, en mi opinión. Sin embargo, no veía motivaciones para seguir leyéndolo. Me tuve que esforzar. Tal vez en otra ocasión intente leerlo nuevamente para ver si tiene un efecto diferente en mí. (2/5)Marality: Ya lo había leído, quizás por eso esta vez también se me hizo pesado además de insípido. Para mí esta historia no tiene sentido. No me parece creíble que una persona pueda llegar a tener semejante reacción ante un hecho no tan aberrante, y que encima tiene (un poco) justificación. Es muy entretenido y se lee rápido, solo eso rescato. (2.5/5)Afterlife: Otro abordaje del autor a la vida después de la muerte. (Puedo mencionar a Willa como otro relato en el que trata el tema, presente enJust After Sunset). Me hizo acordar mucho aReplay, de Ken Grimwood, así que original no me parece. No obstante, es otra obra ligera que se disfruta desde la primera hasta la última oración. (3/5)Ur: Mi segundo preferido de esta recopilación. Por culpa de esta historia me pasé dos estaciones en el tren. Sumamente entretenida, con la correcta dosis de misterio para lograr sumergirme de forma completa en sus páginas. A los que han leído la saga de La Torre Oscura, Ur les va a sacar una sonrisa, se los garantizo. (4/5)Herman Wouk Is Still Alive: Está para ocupar espacio, para hacer más ancho el libro. No tiene nada de especial. Ni buen inicio ni buen final, nada. Es ameno, solamente eso. Puede que a algunos los deje compungidos, pero a mí no. (1.5/5)Under the Weather: Gran trabajo de King. Este también está entre mis predilectos. Excelente desenlace, que, aunque sea predecible, impacta por su carácter. Plantea lo duro que puede llegar a ser cuando uno pierde lo que más ama en el mundo. Triste relato sobre la superación, con ese toque turbador inherente al autor. (4/5)Blockade Billy: Pesado y aburrido. Es un homenaje al béisbol, deporte que ni entiendo ni soy admirador. Es de esa clase de relatos que se recuerdan con odio. Lo único que destaco son las últimas páginas; fue la parte en la que logró engancharme un poco. (2.5/5)Mister Yummy: Está bueno, sin más. A medida que iba leyendo ya sabía lo que iba a suceder. Anticipar al autor no es una señal positiva. Pero valoro mucho la personificación de la Muerte y la relación de los dos protagonistas. (3/5)Tommy: Otro poema. Por favor, señor King, ¡no vuelva a escribir algo como esto! No comprendo cuál es el sentido de publicarlo. No tiene nada que pueda admirar (que es corto, quizá). Espero que otros lectores sean capaces de localizar el oro que se esconde entre sus prosas, si es que hay. (1.5/5)The Little Green God of Agony: Insólita representación del dolor. Esta es la clase de trabajos que quiero leer. Al principio no entendía mucho de qué iba, pero alrededor de la mitad ya se había robado toda mi atención. (3.5/5)That Bus Is Another World: Curiosa interpretación del interior de los colectivos (autobuses). Creo que está para traerle algo frescura a esta antología. No sé si lo recomendaría. Es para leer si estás muy aburrido y querés algo corto para pasar el rato. (2.5/5)Obits: Uno de los mejores, sin duda. Lo malo es que es bastante repetitivo y tiene un final plano. Asimismo, me parece como una variable del relato Everything's Eventual. Pero este es de los que más recomiendo. Imposible apartarse de la historia. (3.5/5)Drunken Fireworks: Gracioso, extravagante, con personajes de lo más peculiares. Un cuento que trata la obsesión y el espíritu competitivo que todos tenemos ardiendo en nuestro interior. (3.5/5)Summer Thunder:What better place to end a collection than with a story about the end of the world?King, ¿qué le has hecho a mi maltratado corazón? Exijo que lo devuelvas a su estado original. Un cuento sobre el amor y la pérdida, sobre adónde puede llegar la naturaleza autodestructiva del Hombre. Un relato muy conmovedor que explora en la angustia de la soledad y lo que es saber que casi todo lo que tenías ya no está y lo poco que te queda morirá. (4.5/5)Nota promedio: 3. Pero ponderando la extensión de los malos y los buenos, y el impacto que tuvieron en mí, como excelente persona que soy subo la nota final a 4. (¡¡Te amo, Steve!!)."

        "user_review": "I think every time I review a Stephen King book, I write something about how he is a much better writer when he isn't doing horror. Where this collection of short stories excels is when King introduces the next story to the reader. His introductions here and in all of his books make you feel like you're just hanging out at the bar with him, enjoying a delicious craft beer, while he breaks down his writing process for you. That stuff is great, but unfortunately, at least in this case, most of his actual stories just missed the mark for me.I could go story by story and give you my thoughts, but I'd rather just say that there are some good stories here. Some stories that hit on relationships and death. A fun story about baseball that ultimately gets way outta control. Man, I love baseball, too. Isn't baseball the best sport there is? Forget the NFL. Sorry.You get more cars destroying people, and there is seriously a story about a Kindle and an alternate universe. Boy, that one was way too long and way too ridiculous. In fact, many of these short stories felt longer than they needed to be.Another issue I had at times, and I've found in other books is that the villains always come across as way too over the top. For example, in Mile 81, the first story, the way King tries to convince me that someone is the bad guy is having them throw out all kinds of disgusting insults that no one would ever really say in real life. It's like he has to use language and cartoon antics to develop the antagonist of the story. But, whatever.King has some really awesome short stories and novellas out there, and a few are sprinkled into this collection. I don't think it's worth reading this from start to finish. Pick out a few and steer clear of the rest. I'll keep you in suspense on what those few are."

I thought I'd be sick of him by now but no I just keep right on reading, I already have the next book picked out. The Bazaar of Bad Dreams wasn't really on my radar but last Friday I was browsing Half Price Books and saw it for $4 and bought it. I didn't even read what it was about until I got home(when I'm in a book buying frenzy I'm dangerous) I was very pleased to find out it was collection of stories. I've said it before and I'll say it again nobody writes a short story like Stephen King. As with all of his collections I have my favorites and my not favorites.My Favorites: Under The Weather- I've read it before and its still one of my all time favorite short stories.The Dune - I love a story with a sick twist ending.A Death - An unexpected favoriteMorality -My grandmother used to say that Greed was the death of moralityAfterlife- Should be a movie or a tv showUr- Has something to do with The Dark Tower series and inspired me to buy the first 3 books.Obits- Should also be a movie or a tv showNot Favorites: The Bone Church and Tommy- I don't like poetry not even poetry written by Stephen King.Stephen King books dont need any recommendations but if you've never read him this collection is a good place to start."

        "user_review": "\"I was mostly interested in the sheriff's progression from a presumption of guilt to a reluctant belief in Trusdale's innocence. Whether Jim Trusdale actually did kill Rebecca Cline was less interesting to me than Barclay's change of mind.\"- Stephen King, in aninterview with The New YorkerIn my opinion, this perfectly sums up the character development during this story. King didn't create characters you'd particularly care for, but he managed to write a thrilling story in an intriguing atmosphere, embedded in a question of morality about belief and faithlessness. \"A Death\" was the first story by King I've read so far, although I bought \"Under the Dome\" a few days ago in the bookstore and couldn't resist to look into it (I should really start buying books only when I've finished the last one, because Ialwaysend up reading countless ones simultaneously), so that I wasn't unfamiliar with the writing style.This short story can be read for freehereand is not even 5000 words long, so ... read this interesting little story. It is worth it.Merged review:Stephen King's latest short story collection consists of twenty (more or less) original stories and novellas, once again proving that King's imagination has not yet ceased to create new horrifying and stunning scenarios which he is able to put so easily and fluently into words. However, there are quite a few reasons for why this collection generally rather disappointed me, even though King managed to hide some true gems in here.I am going to talk about some of them in depth in the rest of this review (without spoiling any plot elements), but so long, as for my reading experience, I can only think of how this collection mildly disappointed and excited me at the same time - a feeling King seems to love to create with his very ambivalent stories. Be sure to read this only if you are used to King's writing style, as I don't think the collection works for non-King readers.1) Mile 81(4/5 stars)Pete, an eleven-year-old boy, explores a closed gas station and becomes drunk for the first time in his life. Julianne, a lesbian farmer caring for horses, drives up at the gas station and finds an old car - a car which hasn't been there when Pete arrived minutes ago, with no driver in sight ...This novella displays a strong introduction to the collection by combining King's more recent writing style with classicChristine-like horror. For me, it was a case of being in the right mood to read this story, because any other day, it might have received only two stars or even one due to its hilarious ridiculousness. But, if you don't mind the ending - and it should have become obvious by now that if there is one thing Stephen King cannot write well, then that's endings - this is a strong story about some interesting characters.Even though King stole one of his own ideas, I can forgive him for that, because this entertaining story made up for a funny hour of reading.2) Premium Harmony(3/5 stars)A short and simple story which managed to stun me with the sadness it made me feel. Available online in a copy of the New Yorkerhere, and recommended for a short read - preferably in the hot summer, as that might add to the story's atmosphere. But don't expect it to be light-hearted ... it isn't. However, it was a very intriguing trip without any typical fantasy/horror elements.3) Batman and Robin Have an Altercation(4/5 stars)This is the way horror could well happen in real life. And the realistic feeling attached to it totally freaked me out, because one day, there is a possibility of us becoming the parents of our parents - and isn't this prospect fear-inducing? Don't be misled by the strange title; this is a very serious story about a man whose father is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.4) The Dune(4,5/5 stars)I usually enjoy protagonists who could be our grandparents, and it was the same with this short story. Featuring an astounding supernatural element and a surprise ending, this proves Stephen King's writing talent perfectly. One of my favorites from the collection.5) Bad Little Kid(5/5 stars)Reminiscent ofThe Green MileandRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: A Story from Different Seasons, this prison story focuses on George Hallas, a murderer who is going to be convicted to death for killing a seven-year-old boy. He talks to his lawyer, Leonard Bradley, about his extraordinary story, and soon the tale drifts off into almost unbelievable tension.My personal favorite out of the collection, and recommended whole-heartedly for every fan of a good horror story.6) A Death(3,5/5 stars)In this story, King didn't create characters you'd particularly care for, but he managed to write a thrilling story with an intriguing atmosphere, embedded in a question of morality about belief and faithlessness. \"A Death\" was the first story by King I've ever read, and for me personally, it was a perfect introduction to his works. This short story can be read for freehereand is not even 5000 words long, so ... read this interesting little story. It is worth it.7) The Bone Church(2/5 stars)Stephen King should stick with short stories. King as a poet? That's like Pennywise as a nice guy. Just doesn't work.8) Morality(3/5 stars)A young married couple's life is turned into complete turmoil when an aging man offers something unexpected. A story about questions of morality unfolded, and while I appreciated the dark undertone King used to deal with the serious topic, this insane story made me feel sick for hours after reading it. The thought that characters like these could be living just across your street is what makes this so horrifying.9) Afterlife(4/5 stars)After his death, a man encounters a possible scenario of the afterlife. Shocking and thought-provoking - easily one of the better King stories.10) UR(3/5 stars)Originally published seven years ago as a Kindle eBook, this novella deals with a university teacher reading in his Kindle and soon figuring out that some aspects of his new purchase are not quite the way they should have been. In the beginning, I was intrigued by the very interesting premise, especially since King referred to a lot of well-known authors like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, but in the end, this drifted off into ridiculousness and left a lot of potential aside without having made use of it. I am mildly disappointed, yet it was definitely an enjoyable read - if you look for something entertaining.11) Herman Wouk Is Still Alive(1/5 stars)I simply didn't get the point of this story. The title is completely misleading, the characters are ... okay, let's better not talk about them; the story is as thin as a sodden piece of water; the writing is close to the worst as it ever got with King. Definitely a story to be forgotten soon.12) Under the Weather(3/5 stars)Again, I felt like something else could have been added to the story to give it more layers. This story is about a man and his ill wife, but it is impossible to add anything else without spoiling the ending. King says himself in the introduction that the ending is easy to be predicted, and it was. The build-up of the tension was nicely done, yet also unsatisfying in the end.13) Blockade Billy(1/5 stars)I am no fan of baseball, and that pretty much sealed the deal for me with this story. There was nothing behind those words which was able to grab me. The baseball jargon doesn't interest me at all, the story was simply consisting of some random plot elements, and the characters were untypically uninteresting, considering how characters are usually King's strength. Not recommended.14) Mister Yummy(3/5 stars)Nothing extraordinary. A gay man in a retirement home reminisces his difficult life of dealing with his sexuality and talks to a friend about his experiences. Easy to forget again.15) TommyAgain: Please, Mr. King, I know those poems are only experiments, but if you ever managed to fail at one awfully, it is in these poems.16) The Green God of Agony(3/5 stars)Typical King horror mixed with interesting characterism and autobiographical experiences results in a disturbing tale which feels so far from being believable that it almost feels real again. The sixth-richest man of the world survives a plane crash in a similar way as King survived his car accident, and despite his nurse's warnings, he now tries to exorcise his pain - with horrible consequences. Interesting story, but not my favorite and difficult to get into.17) That Bus is Another World(3/5 stars)A story surrounding the question of what should I do when I suddenly witness a crime? What are my priorities? Well-done, but also a story which relies mostly on atmosphere and will be forgotten after only a few days.18) Obits(4,5/5 stars)One of my favorite King stories, this deals with a reporter and his way to deal with a supernatural power which enables him to kill people with grave consequences. This is Stephen King at his best.19) Drunken Fireworks(2/5 stars)An entertaining story about the feud of two families, but the entertainment rather lies in its ridiculousness.20) Summer Thunder(3,5/5 stars)An apocalyptic short story recommended to fans of The Stand. Very well-written and memorable.In the end, this collection very much feels like another hit-or-miss gathering of stories, some of which were great, some of them annoying, most rather unconvincing, yet interesting. The most interesting part about this consists of King's introductions he wrote for each and every single one of the short stories, offering a lot of insight into his usual writing process and autobiographical pieces of information."

        "user_review": "Lately I'd been going through a bit of a reading slump. I picked up and put down a number of novels before deciding on King's latest short story collection, The Bazaar of Bad Dreams. While I skipped Uncle Stevie's most recent release, \"Finder's Keepers\" – I wasn't big on its predecessor Mr. Mercedes – I trusted in King to snap me out of my funk. Luckily, my trust was not misplaced.Within King's latest short fiction anthology are twenty tales featuring everything from a mystical Kindle that acts as a window to alternate dimensions (UR), to a man with the ability to kill people through writing obituaries (Obit), to a man who finds out what awaits us after death (Afterlife) as well as many other chilling stories. It should be worth noting that only two are previously unpublished (three if you count the fact that Bad Little Kid had yet to be published in English). Luckily for me, I'd only read three of them (Blockade Billy / Mile 81 / Morality), so there was not a lot of overlap.A few of my favourites include the above mentioned Kindle-centric story UR – which despite initially turning me off due to its blatant product tie-in (first published as a promotional story for the Kindle Singles brand) it managed to shine as a truly original bit of storytelling. I also loved Bad Little Kid, a tale about a bastard of a child who shows up at different points in the life of a man, causing psychological harm to those the man cares about. The final story, Summer Thunder, was a very difficult read as it detailed both the heartbreaking loss of a pet as well as the horror of nuclear war.I was delighted to see Drunken Fireworks included as it was originally released as an audiobook exclusive this summer. I had downloaded it a few months back but could only stomach a little less than five minutes as I strongly disliked the narrator.Overall, I was happy with the collection and I think King's introductions about how each story came to be, added quite a bit to the overall experience. If you're a fan of King's other short story collections, I can't see you walking away disappointed."

        "user_review": "The Not-Quite States of America by Doug Mack is a 2017 W.W. Norton Company publication.These places are cool. These people are wonderful. Why the hell doesn't anyone in the states know anything about them?The embarrassing truth is, I knew absolutely nothing about the American commonwealths or territories before a 2016 segment of\"Last Week Tonight\"on HBO, in which John Oliver comically broke down the set-up in Puerto Rico, which left me utterly flabbergasted. (Look it up on YouTube if you get a chance- It has Lin-Manuel Miranda as the special guest- too.)I did know a tiny bit about Guam, thanks to a few family members who, as Navy reservist, travelled to Guam on occasion. Still, I had absolutely no idea how the laws worked or what the resident's rights were, or anything about the economy, etc.After the John Oliver segment, I wanted to learn more about the territories, so when this book popped up on my radar a few years back, I immediately added it to my list. I pushed it up to the top of the pile when Puerto Rico was slammed by hurricane Maria and a dispute arose over how much aid and assistance the US owed them.Unfortunately, the book slid back down the list again. It wasn't until I decided to clean up my Goodreads 'to read' shelf that I was reminded of it. I plucked it off the list immediately and started reading through it a little at a time.The book reads a little bit like a travelogue, as the author, who fancied himself to be quite knowledgeable about the US, suddenly realizes he knew nothing at all about the US territories and decided to make them his next travel destination.Mack enjoys himself, for the most part, doing touristy things, but also chats up the locals and does plenty of research, even dropping in reading suggestions for a better understanding of each area he visited.The complicated history and incredible laws that give the residents a few freedoms of the states, but depriving them of many others, is explained by laying out the 'pros and cons' in each territory.In the case of Samoa, the residents are considered 'Nationals' but not citizens- of either the US or Samoa. How weird is that?Yet, citizenships foes say:Look, we understand the rights we're giving up. But those rights actually aren't so important to us, given that they'd come, inevitably, as a forced package deal with greater Federal scrutiny of our island and our culture- and with ever-greater American cultural and political takeover. It will lead, inevitably, to further erosion if not willful eradication of our traditional ways. Just look at Hawaii.Oh snap! Yikes!While I can see, and understand, the compelling arguments to remain 'status quo', there are very compelling arguments for statehood, too.The argument is debated- albeit in a good natured way- in Puerto Rico almost daily- at the time this book was published- with was before Hurricane Maria. I'm not sure if that event changed the dynamics of the debate or not.I did like the unique approach the author implemented because we hear directly from the residents, and experience the food, customs, and landscaping along with the history and law lessons. It also keeps the book from being too dry.Overall, this a nice introduction to the topic of United States territories and commonwealths. It explains things- in an as easy to understand way as is possible- under the circumstances.I think it would be wise to jot down the recommended reading the author suggested, for more serious, in- depth, and less casual, information.From a personal standpoint, I will admit I felt very frustrated by what the author aptly describes as 'dysfunction'-but the author also gently reminds readers 'that the residents are proud of their homelands and have no interest in your pity or your patronizing'.I think we could all benefit from educating ourselves on this subject! It is fascinating, and extremely complicated, but also will help put a few things into proper perspective.Despite all the complications, though, it is also very important, in my opinion, to remember the residents of these territories are Americans too, and we should never balk at providing assistance, especially in times of disaster and real human need.The US has profited from Puerto Rico thanks to a few quirky tax laws over the years, and besides, like John Oliver said- We owe Puerto Rico for Lin-Manuel Miranda. 😁😁😁4 stars"

        "user_review": "(3.5)If you've ever wondered what the deal is with America's overseas territories – the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico – this is the book for you. Most of the not-quite-but-basically-colonies came under American rule during a period of conscious expansionism at the turn of the nineteenth century and served as strategic military sites (especially Guam), but now come in for the government's \"benign neglect.\" Mack mixes together jaunty on-the-ground travel observations, interviews with locals, historical surveys, and a clear discussion of the borderline political situation these areas find themselves in. Even where residents don't have full citizenship rights, they pay taxes and sign up for military service at triple the rate of mainlanders. These islands are a mixture of indigenous and American culture, and there are potent arguments both in favor of and against statehood.My favorite chapters were on the Virgin Islands and Samoa, which sound like appealing tourist destinations, especially the national park on Samoa. (Guam, by contrast, sounds like a hideous, hyper-American theme park.) I could feel my eyes glaze over during some of the passages about history, though, so I'd say a stronger-than-average interest in history would be a benefit to anyone undertaking the book.Favorite passages:(the opening of the first chapter on USVI) \"By the time I got to the rum bar in the rain forest, the beer-drinking pigs were already sloshed. The bartender had cut them off.\"\"Yes, there are some problems, some oddities, some kinks in the system. It can be paradise; it can be utterly maddening; it's both, and also, for many residents, just a pleasingly average, American working- and middle-class existence.\""

In the Northern Mariana Islands, he learns about star-guided seafaring from one of the ancient tradition’s last practitioners. And everywhere he goes in Puerto Rico, he listens in on the lively debate over political status―independence, statehood, or the status quo. The Not-Quite States of America is an entertaining account of the territories’ place in the USA, and it raises fascinating questions about the nature of empire. As Mack shows, the territories aren’t mere footnotes to American history; they are a crucial part of the story.",

        "user_review": "This book is part travelogue, part history book, and part rally cry.Doug Mack considered himself very knowledgeable about all things U.S.A. It wasn't until his wife started collecting state quarters that he realized he was vastly ignorant of the territories. He decides to travel to each of them, interacting with the people, participating in some of their cultural festivities, and research their history before and after they became colonies--for even the author agrees that is what we are--of the United States.I have to say that this book was particularly enlightening to me as a Puerto Rican and as a teacher. I have always been vocal about the abuse and neglect Puerto Ricans have endured during our time as a U.S. colony, but had selfishly not researched enough to see that all the territories have faced the same struggle my island nation has. This is an embarrassing omission to make, particularly when I teach about colonialist mentalities when I discuss Steinbeck's The Pearl.I want to thank Doug Mack for opening himself up to this journey and for portraying the struggles--the good, the bad, and the ugly--that we, the second-class citizens of the United States face. I also want to encourage reader both within the fifty states and outside to read this book and instruct yourselves. Particularly with the current political climate where many of us feel our alliance--and citizenship--is tenuous at best."

        "user_review": "Been to Guam lately? Or how about the Northern Mariana Islands? If you have, you are still in the United States......well, sort of. These American territories, along with others scattered around the globe are a result of two things; the Manifest Destiny movement in the US at the turn of the 20th century and WWII. Although the US was not Empire driven, these lands became the \"faux\" Empire and have some of the same laws and benefits of living in the 50 states. But the Constitution didn't necessarily follow the flag and some basic rights enjoyed by the states are withheld from the territories. There are exceptions because there are status designations for each of the territories and the \"American Way\" is consistent with the designation. Confused? You bet.This book is a mix of history and travel as the author visits all the territories, meeting the inhabitants, learning about the culture, and lamenting, with good reason, about the every rapidly receding languages and traditions of the indigenous populations. And how the presence of the American military in the Pacific territories is changing the environment and attitudes of the population. Independence is not on anyone's agenda and it may be that the world will lose some amazing traditions and cultures due to Americanization.The author blends humor through his acquaintance with the colorful locals with serious concern for the future of the territories in an easy to read, entertaining travel guide. It will also make you ponder the future of these far flung specks of land."

        "user_review": "Doug Mack's The Not-Quite States of America (subtitled: Dispatches from the Territories and Other Far-Flung Outposts of the USA) will be a reminder to some that not all of America's citizens live in one of the country's fifty states. To other, perhaps younger, readers, the book will serve as a startling revelation of that same fact because, once a hot topic in the United States, the several territories and possessions still held by the U.S. seldom enter into the public conversation these days. Simply put, not only are they out of sight, they are out of mind.Doug Mack, a travel writer with a degree in American studies, decided to take a look at these forgotten parts of America, beginning with his stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands where he realized that he \"was still in the USA, but far from the states.\" Later on the same trip, Mack spent time in American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico, in each of which he managed to make friends and contacts while trying to determine how the residents feel about their unusual relationship with the United States. Interestingly, it does not particularly seem to bother anyone Mack speaks with that even those Americans aware of the unique relationship between the territories and the rest of the country have all but forgotten how it all happened, and now see the territories as inconsequential \"vestiges from another era.\" Never mind that places like Puerto Rico provide more military recruits per capita than any of America's actual states.Mack tells us that he has been fascinated by \"Americana\" since he was a child and his parents read him road-trip books at bedtime - and he is quick to point out no American road-trip book has ever shown any love for the territories. So where did Mack's fascination with (or at least, his awareness of) the territories begin? Believe it or not, it all started with what he calls \"The Quarters of Destiny,\" the commemorative coin set that celebrated the statehood of all fifty of America's states. So why, he wondered, were several more quarters issued after the one celebrating Hawaii becoming a state in 1959, making it the last state to be admitted to the union?Mack takes his readers on a complete tour of the territories: the commonwealth of Puerto Rico (1898); the organized, unincorporated territory of Guan (1898); the organized, unincorporated territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands (1917); the unorganized, unincorporated territory of American Samoa (1900); and the commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (1976). (Each of the official territory status-designation types has specific legal implications when it comes to the rights and responsibilities of those living there.) Along the way, he is befriended by people he meets on the streets, politicians, business owners (including a semi-famous chef), museum curators, and Americans from the mainland now living in one of the territories who are happy to share with him what it took them years to figures out for themselves.The Not-Quite States of America is both informative and fun to read because of the way Mack alternates sections of hard fact with stories about the kind of thing most of us wish would happen to us when traveling somewhere for the first time: invitations to local parties, private tours of residences and museums, invitations to family meals, bar-hopping with the locals, the chance to speak with prominent local politicians, etc. Surprisingly, many territory residents, as it turns out, are content to remain an American afterthought, much preferring the status quo to becoming just another U.S. state. Mack, who does an admirable job of listing the pros and cons of statehood for each of the territories, makes it easy to understand why many living in the territories would prefer independence to statehood.Part travel book, part American history book, part sociology book, The Not-Quite States of America is always intriguing. What happens next for the U.S. territories remains to be seen, but Doug Mack has done his bit to make the rest of us at least a bit more aware that American soil is more widespread than we may have imagined it to be."

        "user_review": "This wasn't exactly what I hoped for — some descriptions of the \"I went here, and it was very pretty, and I ate a food and met a person\" variety, with none of the humor or richness I want from travel essays. However, as a source of information, this book was embarrassingly useful. It turns out I don't — or at least didn't — know very much about the US territories.I didn't know, for example, that if you're born in American Samoa to American Samoans, you aren't necessarily an American citizen. You're more likely to be an American national, a citizen of no country, and to become a citizen you have to go to an embassy (in New Zealand or Samoa), take a test, and pay a lot of money. I didn't know that we had internment camps on Saipan during WWII (not prisoner of war camps, since everyone on the island was interned); on July 4, Saipan celebrates both US independence from Britain and the release of the internees from the camps — freedom from the US and of the US, both on the same day. Lots of stuff like that. So this was educational.But it was also a bit out of time. Yes, it was only published a year ago, but Mack traveled in 2014 and 2015. Two of the territories he visited were horribly changed by hurricanes in 2017. (There's a painful moment when he mentions that one of the advantages of being part of the US, even with the limited rights and privileges of a resident of the territories, is clean tap water. Yeah, that's ... not really a guaranteed thing anymore.) So this book is, through no fault of its own, not up to date. A lot of its information is no longer accurate.Basically, I'm glad I read this, since there's not a whole lot of writing on the US territories out there, and I feel like a lot of the information in this book is basic stuff I should already have known and didn't. But as a book of travel essays, well, it's a bit dull."

        "user_review": "3.5 starsA book about America's territories: part travelogue, part history, part investigation of the territories' political status, this is a lightweight, readable introduction to a complicated topic. Doug Mack takes readers along on his trip through the territories: beginning in the U.S. Virgin Islands, then traveling to American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific, and ending with a trip to Puerto Rico. He even makes a stop in the Marshall Islands and briefly discusses the U.S.'s \"freely associated states\" of the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia. (These are independent Pacific Island countries that have a special relationship with the U.S., even having U.S. post offices and citizens serving in the U.S. military; as a group, they were best known to me for being the only other U.N. member states to always vote against sanctions for Israel.) Along the way, he shares his research about the territories in an accessible way that provides a good primer for readers new to the topic.I found this book interesting, educational and easy to read. The author shows readers each territory as a unique place and digs into their histories and the history of U.S. international policies more broadly. He also examines the legal oddities governing the rights of the territories and their residents: for instance, they are eligible for some public benefits on their islands, but never become eligible for others even when living in the mainland U.S. (some of which actual foreign immigrants can receive after several years). Meanwhile mainland Americans can't vote for president if they relocate to the territories. Mack pushes for opinions on the territories' political status, and except in Puerto Rico often finds them hard to come by; for the most part, territory residents seem to prefer a flawed status quo to possibly losing individuality by becoming a state, or losing economically by becoming independent.Mack could have improved the book a bit by being a little more willing to go out of his comfort zone as a traveler. He does meet a variety of people living in the territories, including, in the Northern Mariana Islands, a man who spent several years in another part of the Pacific learning traditional navigation, anda woman who immigrated from China to work in the garment factories. But his only exposure to obeah in the U.S. Virgin Islands is asking a well-off couple (he's a local but she is a scuba instructor from the mainland U.S.) about it, to which they essentially smile and roll their eyes. Toward the end, he comments with surprising honesty that \"In all my travels in the territories, I'd seen countless shacks and set foot in many middle-class houses and gaped from afar at the occasional oceanfront villa.\" It doesn't seem to occur to him to try to get invitations to some shacks as well, and the book gives little sense of how most people live in the territories.All that said, with the exception of Puerto Rico, the territories are tiny islands about which relatively little has been written, especially in such an easy-to-read, bite-sized format, and this book did an excellent job of filling them out on my mental map. I would recommend it to any American to learn a bit more about some of the furthest-flung parts of the country. It can even be funny: didyouknow about the U.S. government's machinations in the 19th century to claim uninhabitated islands for their bird poop?"

        "user_review": "Really between three and four stars, but rounding up for the effort.Great premise, with a load of kudos to the author for following up with the idea! However, I wasn't too impressed early on when he stated that he had \"no idea\" therewereAmerican territories, in spite of his background as an \"international journalist\" and history student at university, until he came across their bicentennial quarters. Really? Did he think the U. S. Virgin Islands was an independent country?The first section on the USVI kind of dragged for me, perhaps because I've been there, so the travel narrative aspect wasn't very new, except to learn that they get a fair number of Danish visitors who see them as part of their history also. Not a bad chapter, but just didn't do much to hook me personally.Mack does a lot better with the Pacific region that follows: American Samoa (SAM-oh-ah,notSa-MOW-ah), Guam, and the Northern Marianas. Samoa focuses on their unique status as nationals, but not citizens, of the USA (passports, with residence and employment right in the States, yes; voting elsewhere and TSA (actual citizen-only jobs), no. Guam seemed like a mini-Hawaii to me. Northern Marianas focused on now-defunct garment factory labor exploitation, along with the contrast between their situation and the independent, yet \"associated\" Marianas (there was less contrast between American and Western Samoa, as he seems not to have visited the latter).Finally, there came Puerto Rico. This may not be entirely politically correct, but I found him a bit starry-eyed about their current situation. Still, he did do a good job balancing the views of territorial, statehood and independence advocates. I felt he glossed over the language issue, however.I would recommend the book, especially the audio edition as the narrator seems to have captured the \"voice\" well. I certainly felt as though it were the author addressing me rather than just a reading of the text."

        "user_review": "Thank You to W.W. Norton & Company for providing me with an advanced copy of Doug Mack's The Not-Quite States of America: Dispatches from the Territories and Other Far-Flung Outposts of the USA, in exchange for an honest review.PLOT- Doug Mack's The Not-Quite States of America: Dispatches from the Territories and Other Far-Flung Outposts of the USA, is part travelogue and part history lesson. Mack travels to Puerto Rico, The U.S. Virgin Islands, America Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, to meet the people who inhabit these lands that are \"not-quite part of America,\" and to better understand their history and culture.LIKE- I consider myself fairly knowledgeable when it comes to US History, but Mack has opened my eyes. I had no idea that the United States still has so many territories or that it is so darn muddled regarding the rights of the people living in these areas. I felt a little relieved, when early in his book, Mack, a travel writer, admitted to also being unaware of the full extent of these territories. This made me feel less clueless and in good company. I enjoyed tagging along with Mack, as he visits these islands.. Mack's sense of humor and his interactions with the locals, blends well with the history and politics of each island.Admittedly, some of the politics and legal talk of territories can get a little dry and very confusing, however, Mack puts it out in layman terms, so if I read it carefully, I felt like I was gaining an understanding. My overall impression of the situation is that it is complicated and there is no one solution. I was surprised by the high number of people from the territories serving in the US armed forces, yet depending on where they live, they may not have very many rights. I was shocked by how the rights can vary dramatically from each territory, depending on status ( incorporated/ unincorporated, commonwealth, organized/ unorganized). Seeing how messy this all is, coupled with a general lack of interest or knowledge that most US Citizens have towards the territories, I doubt we will be adding any new states in the near future. It's even presumptuous to think that people in the territories necessarily want statehood. Mack is perceptive with his noting how the idea of colonization is very distasteful and not politically correct, yet colonies are essentially what America still has, even if we call them territories and try to play \"out of sight, out of mind.\"Some of the history, for example the connection between World War 2 and Guam, was familiar. Currently, with North Korea ramping up its nuclear capabilities, and other nations in the Pacific, feeling on edge, these small islands are becoming more valuable for their strategic positioning in future wars. Each country wants to grab what they can in the Pacific for their own security. Mack speaks of this towards the end of his book and it gave me the chills. Speaking of Chills, I was gutted when I read about the thousands of Japanese citizens, including families with small children, committing suicide off of a cliff in Saipan (Northern Mariana Islands) after learning that they had lost WW2. I'm sure that story will forever stick with me.DISLIKE- Nothing. The Not-Quite States of America has left me a better informed citizen, it has given me a new perspective.RECOMMEND- If you're an American citizen, you should definitely add The Not-Quite States of America, to your reading list. Mack is an entertaining writer and his book is important.Like my review? Check out my blog!"

        "user_review": "A fascinating look into the outlying fringes of the US Empire - islands they own but which aren't really part of the States structure - you don't go through passport control to get there if you're traveling from within the US, but the locals have little or no representation in Washington.Mack takes the reader on a journey from the BMVI to American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, exploring these American outposts and their mixture of traditional cultures with an American twist. As someone from Guernsey - an outlying island of the British Commonwealth, I found it fascinating to learn I wasn't the only one living in weird limbo - with a British passport but no rights to vote for the British parliament and no representation in Whitehall.I have to say, this book gave me serious wanderlust. I have added a couple of the locations explored to my bucket list of destinations to visit. I did find myself wishing that Mack had made this more of a travelogue, interviewing more of the local characters that he encounters, and focused less on the history, which at times can become a bit dry, however I appreciate that context is key in positioning the locations in space and time.All in all, a great read and one that had me reaching for Google Maps and flight prices!"

By now, he's figured out that Puerto Rico is actually part of the United States, even if he thinks it's surrounded by \"Big water. Ocean water.\" But does he know about the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands?Doug Mack was all like \"What is THE DEAL with these islands?\" Visiting each of the five populated territories (which are basically colonies, even though we don't like to call them that, because colonialism is so passé), he examines how each became part of the United States (along with the general history), what the current status of the island (or group of islands) is, how the residents feel about that, and what life is like there. His conversational tone reminds me ofJ. Maarten Troostwith less snark. Like any good travel writer, he has a knack for befriending interesting people: members of a biker club, local djs, artists, oddball mainlanders, etc. The result is interesting, informative, and highly readable."

        "user_review": "I hadn't given much thought to the US territories before coming across this title. I chose it in order to educate myself a bit. And this book was informative. I learned that there are 5 US territories, but they all have different levels of affiliation with the US, usually a contentious and oft-debated affiliation. The US hasn't treated the territories well. I don't think Americans like to think of themselves today as colonizers, but that's basically what we've done. We have an empire, and we're not willing to give them full citizen rights. Of course, many people in these territories don't want to become states because they fear how that will affect their cultural identity.I learned a lot, but I found Mack a rather annoying narrator. He tried to be funny, but he wasn't really. And I also got a conservative whiff off of him. Mack loves Teddy Roosevelt, but should we really laud someone some imperialistic, who joined the Spanish-American war for fun? The truth is, the presidents and politicians who supported taking over these lands were imperialists and not looking out for the rights of the islanders. To kick people off their homeland so you can test nuclear weapons, and then not compensate them for the harmful effects of those testings--that's shameful, and a part of the US's legacy that we don't often consider. For bringing that history into the light, I thank Mack. I just wish he'd had a more critical eye to America's meddling."

Norton and CompanyPublished In: New York, NY; London, EnglandDate: 2017Pgs: 306_________________________________________________REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSSummary:50 states, et al.American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S.Virgin Islands...4 million people who fly the American flag, baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, but, not statehood. History, independence, statehood, the status quo, the nature of empire._________________________________________________Genre:NonfictionTravelTravel WritingUnited StatesRegionsHistoryWorldWhy this book:'merica._________________________________________________Least Favorite Character:The racist bastards who flummoxed the normal progression that should have lead to these territories, re: colonies, being states by now. And to the Supreme Court for abetting that racist, imperialist agenda.The Feel:The weight that he feels when he starts rudimenting on the atomic bombs dropped on Japan as he stands alongside the runway on Tinian that the B-29s launched from.Favorite Scene / Quote:When Mack describes the shack on the beach in American Samoa with the outdoor shower and the full, layered Milky Way haloing the sky and the perfect night that it was with he and his wife there, his description only leaves out one thing that in deference to he and his wife wouldn't do to be described since it isn't that kind of book. But it's so custom romance made, that anyone who reads the scene and doesn't think it has no soul.When the kids in the village on Aunu'u in American Samoa started following Mack and his wife around asking if they knew various people in the village, so, he asked if they knew Prince who was from his village of Minneapolis.Description of the crush of a 4th of July on Guam with so many tourists from so many places that he hit upon a way of IDing them from the locals by the degree of red, white, and blue they were wearing. Reads like a cultural hurricane, force 1776. Guam as gateway to all things American, America on a budget, from China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, etc.Pacing:For a travelogue/documentary style book, the pacing is very good.Word Choice / Usage:The way Mack describes Guamanian barbecue made my mouth water.Hmm Moments:The United States Virgin Islands, the USVI, seem to be searching for an identity or more appropriately living in a vacuum. They have a history, but it is sanitized to Disneyfied levels. Their real history exists far away in archives in Washington DC and Copenhagen, Denmark.WTF Moments:When the modern legal professor tried to explain the incorporated/unincorporated territories' standing to the author, who didn't make any bones about them being held at arm's length and blocked from the path to statehood being at base an exercise in institutionalized racism. She pointed out that you can find it in all the, so-called, Insular Cases. The Cases were legal challenges that were ruled by the Supreme Court, ultimately, and governed the disposition of those territories seized and annexed in the United States' Imperial Moment. Those territories populated by people, not like those of the English, re: White, United States were owned by, but not part of the United States.The ghost town moments on Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas bring to mind Detroit; abandoned malls: empty hotel: etc.Wisdom:The USVI should be put on the parth to either statehood or independence. The same should happen with all of the inhabited territories.In contrast to the USVI, American Samoa, whose inhabitants want citizenship, but want to maintain their intrinsic cultural and societal identity, are caught in a catch-22. If they adopt the Constitution in totality, some of their cultural and social norms would be considered unconstitutional and ripe for lawsuit and being legislated out of existence. Maybe their solution would be to go the statehood route with the proviso, that upon gaining statehood, they would be, enshrined is the wrong word, encapsulated...incorporated as a reservation in the manner of the First Peoples' Reservations in Oklahoma.Guam seems way passed ready for statehood.Whatever gets done vis-a-vis statehood, all residents of these territories born there should be given birthright American citizenship. Some of these territories have been American for over a hundred years. These territories as a percentage of population outserve the states in numbers of members of the military. They deserve citizenship.Reid v Covert, SCOTUS: 1957, Hugo Black, plurality decisionThe concept that the Bill of Rights and other Constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperant when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefits of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our government.When Mack started trying to put his thoughts together for his conclusion and hit up on the idea that there were 4 groups that were in all the territories: the Change-Averse-who support the status quo/better off with the United States and partly on their own; the Nationalists-who support independence; the Melting Pot Optimists-for all its flaws, the United States has brought a lot of good things, they are proudly American, And want to become a state; and the Jaded Realists-like it or not, they are depended on the USA and that won't change if they are an independent nation. Might as well be stuck with them. There's not stopping cultural change, globalization is the new Americanization.Missed Opportunity:These territories existing in a racist, imperialist limbo, some since 1900 or before, is a travesty on the Constitution's face. That's American soil, those are American citizens. They need to either be on the path to statehood and birthright citizenship or on their way to independence._________________________________________________Last Page Sound:Very good.

        "user_review": "The Jones Act. The Insular Cases. Unincorporated Territories. These once obscure terms entered the daily conversation after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. No longer were the territories (or at least two of them) out of sight and out of mind. For a few weeks, they were front and center.Also front and center were the obstacles that their political status posed to both local and federal recovery efforts. Among these obstacles was the US government itself. Only weeks after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, Donald Trump made clear how his administration views the territories, saying that the US government could not keep FEMA, the military, and other first responders in Puerto Rico \"forever.\" His message to post-Harvey Texas, on the other hand: \"We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, and REBUILD.\" Part travelogue, part history, Doug Mack's The Not-Quite States of America offers a lively, thoughtful introduction to this complicated relationship between the United States and its territories.There are currently five populated territories. Four of these, US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands, are unincorporated organized territories, meaning that they have been given some degree of self-rule by an organic act (which acts as a territorial constitution) but are not considered part of the United States. American Samoa is neither organized nor incorporated. As a result of a set of Supreme Court decisions referred to as the Insular Cases, the US Constitution applies only in a limited manner in the unincorporated territories. As Mack notes, this results in an odd situation, where a person on the uninhabited but incorporated territory of Palmyra Atoll has more constitutional rights than someone in Puerto Rico. Each of the five main chapters to one of these inhabited territory, beginning with the US Virgin Islands and ending with Puerto Rico. In these chapters, he mixes descriptions of his own experience with the perspectives of those who live on the territory, while also providing brief sketches of each territory's social, political, and cultural history.Mack is an engaging travel writer, ably describing island sunsets, lush jungle scenery, and indigenous traditions. At the same time, he is also capable of sharp historical insight. This is most clearly demonstrated when he attempts to answer the question of why the US took possession of these outlying territories in the first place. He touches on the history of the United States' Imperial Moment, when it became clear that the US really was an empire, (a term that appears to have been much less shocking to mainstream commentators in the late-19th and early-20th centuries than to their late-20th and early-21st century counterparts). And to answer the question of why these territories remain \"not-quite states,\" he introduces the Insular Cases.Of these, Downes vs. Bidwell offers the clearest, if most uncomfortable, answer. Essentially, unlike earlier territories which were inhabited \"only by people of the same race\" (and oh, yeah, maybe some Indians), the \"distant and outlying possessions\" were populated \"alien races, differing from us in religion, customs, laws, methods of taxation, and modes of thought\" which would make impossible \"the administration of government and justice, according to Anglo-Saxon principles.\" In other words, while some of the territories, particularly Puerto Rico, have appeared to be on the path to statehood with the passage of an Organic Act, they were not inhabited by white Europeans, so they were not fit to be states. On the other hand, as Mack notes, residents of the territories have often rejected changes in status, both statehood and independence. So the status quo, while built on a foundation of a racialized, colonial view of the territories, is not upheld by such a perspective alone.So what does the future hold for the territories? Mack calls for the organization of American Samoa and the incorporation of all current territories so that they are \"truly part of the country\" and fully entitled to Constitutional protections, as well as for Congressional representation and a presidential vote. He also argues passionately for those of us who live in the States to begin thinking about the residents of the territories not as \"foreign aliens\" but as Americans. Unfortunately, as much of the media shifts its focus away from the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, such a change in perspective seems as elusive as ever."

        "user_review": "Plucked this off the new book shelf at the library, hoping to learn more about the US territories. Interesting information, some of which I'd heard before, but also new commentary, such as on page 40: \"...the Affordable Care Act essentially forgot about the territories.\" Why does this not surprise me?Not sure why Mack only visited St Thomas and St Croix, when IMAO St John is the most pristine of the VI? So I'll throw in my two cents, for what it's worth. Having owned property and spent an inordinate amount of time with the local St Johneans, they are some of the warmest people I have met in my extensive travels. My impression is that they feel status quo is the way to go vs independence or statehood. Why rock the boat when, for the most part, they enjoy a comfortable lifestyle? Since St John is the smallest of the VI and about 60% is National Park, thanks to Laurance Rockefeller who donated the land in 1956, it has a totally different aura. Yes, there are expats and tourists, but they are mostly repeat visitors who stay for long periods of time and blend in with the locals. Since there is no airport or cruise port, it's a bit off the beaten path. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. I'm in love with \"Love City,\" which Cruz Bay, the main town, is affectionately called.Sections about Samoa, Guam and the Pacific territories, combine military history, some statistics and silly anecdotes.Puerto Rico becomes more complicated with very diverse views as to its' future.If nothing else, the book makes one think about what it means to be American, especially in this day and age."

Scattered shards in the Pacific and the Caribbean, the not-quite states―American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands―and their 4 million people are often forgotten, even by most Americans. But they’re filled with American flags, U.S. post offices, and Little League baseball games. How did these territories come to be part of the United States? What are they like? And why aren’t they states? When Doug Mack realized just how little he knew about the territories, he set off on a globe-hopping quest covering more than 30,000 miles to see them all. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, Mack examines the Founding Fathers’ arguments over expansion. He explores Polynesia’s outsize influence on American culture, from tiki bars to tattoos, in American Samoa. He tours Guam with members of a military veterans’ motorcycle club, who offer personal stories about the territory’s role in World War II and its present-day importance for the American military. In the Northern Mariana Islands, he learns about star-guided seafaring from one of the ancient tradition’s last practitioners. And everywhere he goes in Puerto Rico, he listens in on the lively debate over political status―independence, statehood, or the status quo. The Not-Quite States of America is an entertaining account of the territories’ place in the USA, and it raises fascinating questions about the nature of empire. As Mack shows, the territories aren’t mere footnotes to American history; they are a crucial part of the story.",

Lots of stories, interesting characters, history, culture, place descriptions and musings by the author. The final chapter was weak (the author's opinion about what the future status of there territories \"ought\" to be), but overall I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about the places covered."

        "user_review": "The U.S. territories are far-flung, fascinating, and perplexing. They are also, in the words of Doug Mack, \"the most important domestic-policy issue Americans aren't talking about, precisely because we don't think of them as a domestic-policy issue at all\" (253).I learned so much from this book. Part travelogue, part history, part deep dive into the territories' legal/political status,The Not-Quite States of Americais a great introduction to parts of America that most Americans know very little about. But the territoriesarea part of America, and for that reason alone, as Mack concludes, \"We need to talk about the territories again. We need to start listening to them, too. The people of these far-off islands are not 'foreign aliens.' They are us\" (280).This book is a great starting place to get the conversation going.2020 Reading Challenge Category: A book with more than 20 letters in its title."

        "user_review": "Excellent book about the inhabited US territories.There are 5 US territories: US Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. Persons born in these areas are US citizens by birth except for those born on American Samoa who are US Nationals but are not citizens until they go through the naturalization process. This is because they are Unorganized as opposed to Organized territory.Does the US Constitution include activities and persons in the territories? Yes and no. It depends on the mood of the day. Originally the US wanted expansion for military and economic reasons. They believed that territory residents were \"alien races\". Even the Supreme Court upheld this view. These cases are called the insular cases. Teddy Roosevelt selected Oliver Wendell Holmes as a Supreme Court Justice because he would uphold the insular cases. However, slowly in our modern times, these cases are slowly being eroded.Do these territories want independence or statehood or organized (for American Samoa)? There is much debate about this. However, from the reading, it appears that most residents are willing to remain with the status quo.The author travels to each of these 5 territories to learn more about their culture, history and political tendencies. Do I now want to travel to these territories? Not really but some do seem interesting. I would like to visit US Virgin Islands one day.Interesting facts:-- The worlds largest K-Mart is in Guam.-- The disappearance of Amelia Earhart occurred on her flight to Howland Island, part of the US Minor Outlying Islands, and near America Samoa.-- The only part of the US south of the equator is America Samoa.-- The easternmost point of the US is Point Udall, St Croix, US Virgin Islands (named for Stewart Udall, Arizona congressman and Secretary of Interior for Kennedy and Johnson)-- The westernmost point of the US is Point Udall, Guam (named for brother Arizona congressman Morris \"Mo\" Udall)I learned about US Government that I´m sure I did not learn in school."

        "user_review": "I really struggled with this book. Really, really struggled. I hate to review it poorly--Doug Mack seems like a nice, if exceedingly boring guy. He took a concept I was wildly excited about (learn more about the territories! discuss issues of justice pertaining to their tenuous role in the United States' government. Learn more about far away places and cultures and food!) and just made it completely un-captivating. I read this on and off over 6 months or so. I kept forcing myself to go back to it because i cared about the subject matter. and yet I find I barely remember what I read about any of the territories. By now the information about Puerto Rico and the USVI is sadly dated, in the wake of the hurricanes of 2017. and in an era of trump, there are so many additional questions about how these territories will be affected by an administration that disdains brown people and poor people, which the territories are chock full of.So I suppose I learning some things, about the political structuring of the various US territories, and the feelings of the citizens of those territories about their status. I did retain the information about the shady dealings with garment factories in the Northern Marianas Islands, and their eventual exit, leaving a poorer territory behind them, with abandoned buildings.But overall, I think watching John Oliver's segment on the US territories would be a quicker, more memorable, and more engaging way to get a brief overview of this information. But maybe that's just me. Like, I said, Doug Mack seems like a nice enough guy, who loves his wife and cares about people other than himself. So hopefully others enjoyed his book more than I did. (just don't listen to this on audio. the narrator does not have a pleasing voice, IMO.)"

        "user_review": "Received an ARV via NetGalleyThis book is about the United States Territories/Commonwealths and is a combination of travelogue, history, cultural information, and the difference in their legal rights from mainland U.S. The territories are Virgin Islands of the United States (4 Islands), American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico. It is not really a travel guide, but he does mention where he visits and eats. He doesn't say who has the best local cuisine in each location, but does tell you where to go in the US Virgin Islands to watch a pig drink a beer. He talked and explored with those that live in the Territories so that he can get information and sights that not many people know about. He combines some strange facts with serious information and research on history and the rights of the territory residents. He does explain some terminology so that the layperson can understand what he is discussing. He had asterisks next to information and then there was additional information at the end of that section. I am assuming that they are doing numbered footnotes for the finished book. He also has done research on why the US added non-connected land as our territories in the 1800s and early 1900s. He has talked to people who are experts and tries to explain it to the reader in a simple and straightforward way. He does include maps of each location, but on my tablet, it was hard to see detail. I would wish for a little more zoomed in map to be able to see the cities he mentions in the book. A unique look at the territories that don't get much attention from the 50 states."

        "user_review": "I was already looking forward to Doug Mack's new book since I had enjoyed his first, Europe on Five Wrong Turns A Day, about his travels in Europe using the fifty year old guidebook his mother used on her youthful trip abroad in the 1960s. The Not-Quite States of America was not-quite what I expected -- it was a bit more serious than the first book although it had its humorous moments. This one reminded me of Sarah Vowell and her American history treks.Mack checks out the American Territories in the Caribbean and the South Pacific, remnants of our Empire building days around the turn of the 20th century. Each territory has a unique status in which residents (who are all United States citizens) may or may not have voting rights or representation in Washington, D.C. He traces the history of the U.S./Territorial relationships, chats with many longtime residents, discusses the politics and legal aspects of the not-quite states, and sometimes just has a look around and enjoys the tropical atmosphere.This was a new topic for me and I found it fascinating from a historical perspective as well as from a tourist vantage.(Thanks to NetGalley and W.W. Norton & Company for a digital review copy.)"

Many Americans were shocked (and some in denial) after the 2017 Hurricane Maria disaster to learn that Puerto Ricans are in fact American citizens. Local author Doug Mack, realizing that he knew next to nothing about places like American Samoa, Guam or The Northern Mariana Islands, despite them being American soil, set out on a mission to visit and find out more about these territories, their cultures and their unique and disparate political and legal statuses.I learned so much from this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they already know everything of importance about American culture and geography. It's really quite eye-opening, and Mack is pretty witty, too."

While I wasn't looking for an academic treatment, this history/travelogue mash-up is just a little too slight to give me all the information I want about the U.S. territories and possessions. It's great that the writer actually visited the places to see how they are faring today, but I think he gives too much weight to his time spent with a few colorful individuals in each place. I'm not a fan of travel writing, but the little bit of history and analysis Mack does manage to throw in makes his tourist profundity tolerable, and the off-beat but fascinating topic earns him some overall bonus points."

        "user_review": "A really interesting look at the non states that make up the US. This started when the author's wife found a territory quarter and ended with him traveling to the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marinaras, Puerto Rico and beyond. He explored the different cultures, governments, histories and treaties that brought these parcels of land into America, yet how they weren't really American in the same way as those of us who live in the States. The varying histories and court cases were really fascinating, as were the Americans he met along the way."

        "user_review": "LOL. How'd this happen? I've had an up-and-down relationship with Lucy Knisley for a few years now, with her most recent book,Something New,representing its absolute nadir. Ugh,Something New.So when I saw a Goodreads giveaway for Knisley's new book,Kid Gloves, my first instinct was to stay far away. A faint spark of curiosity caused me to enter the giveaway anyway, but I was of course fully expecting that I wouldn't win. The odds were against it, after all. I guess we can all see what happened next!I am therefore thrilled to report to you thatKid Gloveswas great! As I've mentioned before on Goodreads, I'mnot particularly interestedin the fertility/pregnancy/childbirth narratives of people I don't know at all, but Knisley really does her homework here, and this book is an entertaining and highly informative feminist analysis of all of these issues, in addition to being Knisley's own personal story.And it's that personal story that's the most revelatory here. As a happily childless person, I would never, ever, ever, ever in a million years buy into the idea that childless people are inherently more self-centered than people with kids; anyone who truly believes that is just being a jerk. But as far asLucy Knisley herselfis concerned, her motherhood journey seems to be just the big life event she needed to jolt her into a place of more maturity, insight, and depth in her work. I was excited and appreciative and happy to see this development and to experience its end result in this book.Honestly, I tried to keep an open mind going intoKid Glovesbut in reality it's hard to think of a more hostile audience for this book than myself. Yet, I really, really enjoyed and admired this. 2019 is starting out as the year ofauthors subverting my expectations, and no one could be happier about this than me. I am still not sure if I'll read Knisley's next book, but I'm grateful I read this one. Thank you, Lucy. Thank you, First Second publishers, for winning back my trust. Thank you everyone! Read this book."

        "user_review": "Lucy Knisley tells us at one point that she does NOT want to suggest that having a baby is \"a terrible experience,\" after having just told us several terrible things that happened to her, but I can say reading her book was for me at times a stressful experience, since her detailed account of her way difficult pregnancy, in spite of being enhanced by information gleaned by constant research she has done, and broken up by some laughs, reveals that she had the Pregnancy and Childbirth (her first) From Hell. Since Knisley, like Quebec artist Michel Rabagliati, is writing memoirs about all stages of her life (and I am reading all of them!), she is committed to being here--as in her memoir about getting married, Something New: Tales from a Makeshift Bride --educational, entertaining, and painful honest about what she has experienced with her husband John (whom I love and want to take out for a beer). The marriage memoir was also angsty but very, very light-hearted compared to this one, though, trust me.Now, consider the source if you decide to continue reading this review; while Knisley makes the occasional nod to \"non-breast-feeders\" (which of course includes millions of women who have never done so, as well as men), her primary audience here is women who want to have babies and who have had them. And I guess her fans, like me, who have been following her for many years, just to keep up with what is going on, with her most dramatic story yet. She is essentially journaling the process, with an emphasis on the challenges: Miscarriages, depression, pain, anxiety, vomit, more vomit, swelling, embiggening mom body, so much pain at almost every stage, so much stress, and so on. She tells this in part to be helpful about all the possible pitfalls that are there for those wanting to have babies, some of which is not in the usual baby guides, such as What to Expect When You are Expecting (which I have read a couple times myself).Some of what Knisley shares is also humorously self-deprecating; she admits she eats 6 dates a day because she has learned that it will bring on labor, and so on. She follows advice from a million different sites and people. She's anxious, she's worried, and scared, and so this is in part useful to share, as if in solidarity with all other prospective-mom worriers. There is a lot of humor mixed into this anxiety cake, but let's face it, this is not a typical pregnancy nor childbirth, if there ever was one. Hers was very, very hard and this—in spite of all the inviting fun colors and cute drawing that has made her justifiably famous--is not an advertisement for having a baby. It focuses on all the bad things that can and do happen, because they actually did happen to her. Maybe the colors are a kind of false advertising? Or maybe they just help to lighten things up a bit?I love it that one section is written from John's perspective, which happens to be the Actual Birth part, and trust me, when he cries in meeting \"Pal\" and they both cry in meeting him, you cry, because that's what you do in relief and happiness when a healthy baby arrives. Maybe it's more emotional for us knowing what she has been through to get to this point.I say all this having very actively participated in multiple pregnancies and childbirths, and as a male, I know, it is of course different, but I could relate to a lot of the anxiety and fears and worries. And I think it has a lot of useful information and is interesting, never boring. The actual photographs in this book are cute, to break up all the foreboding and give you hope that pregnancy may indeed lead to joy. It seems to have done so for her, at last.So she has a baby! Knisley also then writes a picture book, You Are New, to (maybe, I am assuming here) in part celebrate this new baby, though the picture book is the first book I have read from her that is not about her. Anyway, I think this is a very good book, given all it attempts to do. Did I \"enjoy\" it? Not so much, but I appreciated it and I am thinking about it a lot. Would I recommend it to my friends who are trying to make a baby? I don't know. I don't want to scare them away, and I think this just might do it in spite of Knisley's stated hopes to the contrary.Here is Kathleen's review in the Chicago Tribune (and you can follow her on Goodreads, too):https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifest...Another review, \"an honest look at pregnancy, barf and all\": The \"weirdness of pregnancy,\" yes, but it almost killed her:http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Mag..."

        "user_review": "***SPOILERS HIDDEN***With the hell Lucy Knisley went through during her first pregnancy and delivery, I'll be shocked if she has another kid.Kid Glovesis very much a memoir--one I wholeheartedly donotrecommend to anyone who's thinking about getting pregnant or is currently pregnant. It should be pointed out that Knisley's harrowing ordeal is not typical. Sheexperienced morning sickness so severe that she thought she could have Hyperemesis Gravidarum; developed most pre-eclampsia symptoms, yet her doctor dismissed them; then she developed actual eclampsiaand almost diedafter giving birth. There's more. Much more.I enjoyed reading her account because it makes for a compelling story, but I was shocked by how much she endured. My overall impression is that her body is highly sensitive; as she details at the beginning, she experienced unusual struggles with allergies and intolerances to several different contraceptives, long before she ever got pregnant.Knisley is a talented cartoonist. Images are clean and vivid and text is easy to read and flows in a logical manner. Most importantly, she illustrated well the extent of her, to put it euphemistically, \"pregnancy journey,\" from struggles to get pregnant to the end result: her adorable son. She also interspersed nonfiction facts about how pregnancy was regarded and handled through the centuries. Much of this overlaps with women's rights throughout time, as the meddling role of men in women's health is emphasized.I do think Knisley should've made clear that the--as she put it--\"chaos\" she endured was unusual, that she had a dramatically bad pregnancy.Kid Glovesis otherwise excellent. It strikes emotional chords while educating at the same time. If people--or her son--ask her what her pregnancy and childbirth was like, she can hand them an actualbookabout it. Given all she went through, it's fitting."

        "user_review": "Kid Gloveslooks like another cutesy book about pregnancy, but it's a lot more than that. It also features myths and facts about pregnancy, some interesting history regarding how far obstetric medicine has come, tidbits about medical struggles, and most notably, a long section on infertility and miscarriages.There's a point Lucy makes at one point that really resonated with me, as a fellow miscarriage survivor:If 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage, why aren't 25% of media portrayals of pregnancies acknowledging that?Instead, we live in a world where people are made to feel guilty, ashamed, and/or tragically alone after a miscarriage, and we have to do better. It isn't fair for anyone to suffer these traumas alone.While it got a bit boring at times, overall, I thoughtKid Gloveswas an interesting pregnancy memoir. I'm not sure I would give it to an expectant mother, because I think it would have terrified me to read about Lucy's emergency c-section and pre-eclampsia in such vivid details, but it was still fascinating to read about and heart-warming to know that everything turned out okay for Lucy and her little family in the end.Thank you so much to the publisher for providing me with this ARC in exchange for an honest review!"

        "user_review": "This is now one of my favorite Lucy Knisley books.As she discusses in this book, in each of her previous works, she chronicles a transitional point in her life. In the popular French Milk, she is a markedly less sympathetic character, being in that moody period of her late teenage years. But in her subsequent works, we see her develop into a passionate, empathetic adult who struggles to balance a career, family, and relationships.In her animated form, we walk with Lucy back into a \"never-quite-over\" relationship and then escort her down the aisle to marry her perfect quirky counterpart, John. And now, in Kid Gloves, Lucy gets even more grown up, taking us on the roller coaster ride of getting pregnant and becoming a mother. It was not an easy ride at any point; Lucy struggled through devastating miscarriages only to discover she needed a surgical procedure to be physically capable of carrying a baby to full term. Once this was performed and she successfully conceived, her difficult pregnancy began and eventually concluded with the nearly fatal delivery of her son.I follow Lucy on social media so I had an inkling of some of the things she was going through at this point in time, but obviously this book gives a much deeper look. The whole experience was very educational for Lucy as she tried to unpack not only what was happening to her body after becoming pregnant, but also all the cultural expectations and misunderstandings there are around the whole affair. So much of the experience of pregnancy is kept behind a veil and cultural conditioning has fed us a lot of baloney that simply isn't based in fact. Lucy draws us an education on issues and beliefs about pregnancy and childbirth while giving us, as always, a highly entertaining inside look into her own journey.Though it was horrifying at points and reaffirmed my decision to never carry any children of my own, it was touching to see how Lucy's son Pal (a nickname she gave him for social media to protect his identity) came into the world. He is one cute kid."

        "user_review": "One of Lucy Knisley's undeniable strengths is that she is hardcore a Capricorn: by the age of thirty-one, as she tells you herself in this very book, she'd published five graphic memoirs, each one as cleanly constructed as if from a kit, gleaming with that I-write-outlines-for-my-to-do-lists singlemindedness goats are known for.I've read almost all of them. They are each of them lovely, bright and tidy as a paperdollhouse. And I slam through them--as unselfconsciously personal memoirs by a woman, they are precisely up my alley, and compulsively readable.And yet every single time I find myself having the same puzzling experience: Why don't I love them?The Lucy of these memoirs is brimming with self-assurance, and her experiences are of the largely consequence-less, upper-class variety: cultivating a relationship with gourmet food, going to art school, taking European vacations, DIYing a roomily-budgeted wedding.They are memoirs without stakes, and therefore without urgency: confession without viscera, self-reporting without introspection; more captain's log (the waves and the clouds) than anything scraped up from diving into the wreck (whether blue or breathing).Even this latest remains perplexingly landlocked. Kid Gloves is about the most harrowing, primeval experience a human can go through, yet Knisley renders it in the same antiseptic pastels with which she drew her wedding plans.There's this great quote from Aline Kominsky that I don't have memorized but where she talks about what kind of art she likes and she says she likes to see some of the struggle.That's what I like, too, and it's the opposite of Knisley's work.You won't see any struggle here: her line is smooth and her palette soothing, with everything from the sweaters to the sidewalks, the bushes to the vaginas, rendered textureless and benign, comprising an evenly contained but eerily shadowless world. Her panel layout is textbook-worthy craftsmanship, sturdy but flexible, creative but compliant.All of which make for a highly engaging but never quite electric read; she's always a B for me. A gentleman's 6.So what am I saying here. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this book. I enjoy all of her books, and I enjoy them progressively more as she goes, so I enjoyed this one the most of all. I'm not even saying it's not a good book: itisa good book, and thorough.I guess I'm just saying I've been reading Knisley for some years now and I keep waiting for her to mine a gnarlier vein. Which might never happen, because not everyone needs to skin the whole cat, Hannah. A lot of people don't even like skinned cats, OK? You can snuffle your filthy old nose around in your Dirty Laundries and Plottes all you like and then appreciate this on its own merits, for what it is and excels at being: charmingly executed, carefully researched, and another genuinely impressive contribution from a talented, committed creator."

I keep reading these pregnancy books about these horror birth stories and maybe I should stop.Being pregnant is such a game changer. I have seen it happen to my friends, watch them cross the Rubicon, and then wave to me from the other side. And now it is my turn and I do feel a little lost, so all I do is read book after book on the subject, but I remain as perplexed as I was. I am pregnant and there is an actual tiny human inside me, kicking and thrashing about. What the heck."

        "user_review": "Shortly after I gave birth, I had the sudden realization that \"holy SHIT there are hundreds-thousands-millions of women walking around who have also gone through this wildly intense rollercoaster of an experience.\" And yet - there's not much in the mainstream that really tells the truth about this, which left me scrambling last year to figure out what was going on and what was normal. I loved this graphic memoir for its honesty, humor, and simple offering of firsthand experience.I've seen plenty of reviews that encouraged women newly pregnant or with new babies to read this - and that's true, it's important to have a place to feel seen. BUT I also think people who are never going to be pregnant should also spend some time here. If you're not going to be pregnant yourself, you are going to know someone who is. Being pregnant myself made me want to be honest about what was happening then, and now. I think you'll find this fascinating, learn a bunch, and understand how to love the new parents in your life.One thing I adored about this book is the history of pregnancy research she dives into, ranging from historical (\"the walking uterus\") to misconceptions about miscarriage and infertility. She reminds us that one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, brings to light the way a woman's pregnant body is treated as a commodity, gets into the not always pleasant but wholly real process of growing another person inside your own body.An easy five stars with a side of HELL YES."

We've been through her new adulthood, her marriage, and it's now time for the baby carriage.Unlike her previous works, this one does more than explore her life and foibles. In addition to covering her personal experiences as she transitions to being a mother, there is a fun (if a tad horrific) illustrated history and science of reproductive health, with some of the key figures in the field. The art continues to be cutesy, but her talent for story telling has clearly matured. This is her best work yet."

Kid Gloves is an (adult) graphic-format memoir of trying to conceive, pregnancy and childbirth, and Knisley doesn't hold back in writing and drawing about struggles, grief and ALL of the ups and downs (and physical detail) of this stage of her life. I highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in this topic as well as to high school health teachers, since the book touches on things the author wishes had been taught in school about birth control."

Knisley had a pretty brutal time with both pregnancy and birth: 2 miscarriages, all day nausea that lasted the whole first trimester, pre-eclampsia symptoms (which her doctor ignored), a c-section, and then full on eclampsia. I marvel at how she presents all of this extremely vulnerable material in such a matter-of-fact way. She even has her husband do the parts where she was unconscious!"

        "user_review": "My favorite Knisley comic so far. As I was reading this, I realized -- like she does herself -- how few stories of pregnancy focus on the mother and her experiences and needs. This does it, and it made me feel a wave of things, including a lot of anger.There's so little education and talk about what bodies do or don't do. Those who can give birth are under the impression it's easy. It's not. I know so few who have had easy, uncomplicated pregnancies (let alone births). I didn't know about the ways a body doesn't create the fetus \"like it should\" until I experienced that myself not too long ago. Seeing it on the page there, her second miscarriage, really knocked the breath out of me, since that was my experience of a few days of potential only to learn that nothing ever happened.My only wish was more of what did or did not happen with the reproductive endocrinologist, but the fact is there might not have been anything noteworthy there to write about. The breakdown of how insurance and health care for that was a reminder of how lucky I felt when I learned my state requires insurance to cover RE expenses and requires a certain level of coverage for various IUI/IVF procedures.Just fantastic. After I'd read Knisley's last graphic memoir, I wanted her to move away from her own stories. She does that here, while also making this wholly her story. And it was exactly what I'd hoped for."

I loved my time reading this: I learned new things; I smiled at quirky or silly faces (her puking drawings... lol); I laughed out loud (please tell me more about elephant gestation); I nodded slowly reading about miscarriage stats and the maternal mortality crisis affecting the U.S.; and I cried because of what Knisley went through and the book's ending.If you like learning about pregnancy/women's reproductive health from a cultural, political, and health perspective this ponders history and the current day. If you like an intimate and very honest personal perspective in your graphic memoirs, this will also appeal to you. I'm so happy this book was finally published and I totally recommend following Lucy Knisley on Instagram."

        "user_review": "Wow, this made me feel a much wider range of emotions that I had originally anticipated. I hadn't read what Knisley's story was or the summary of this graphic novel, I honestly just thought this was going to be a run-of-the-mill pregnancy story. Nope, not even close. Knisley unfortunately suffered through a few miscarriages and went to a pretty deep, dark place before she was able to get pregnant with her baby boy. I'm a pretty big watcher of the family vlogger youtube scene and by now I've seen quite a few that have gone through some kind of loss. Even though this kind of thing is EXTREMELY hard to read about/watch (especially while pregnant) I think everyone needs to. 1 in 4 people who get pregnant will have a miscarriage. THAT IS CRAZY. That number is so high and still, I can personally feel this stigma around not talking about it, even though I've never had one myself. Like who cares if it makes people feel uncomfortable? That momma needs to grieve and should never have to keep a journey like that all pent up inside just in the face of keeping other people around them comfortable. Phew...Anyway, I was able to relate to this story in the sense that I developed pre-eclampsia with my first pregnancy, too. My story was thankfully nothing like hers (I didn't find out I had it until week 39 because I wasn't exhibiting any symptoms other than a slowly rising blood pressure and I was induced that night and was able to have the baby vaginally still) but still.....again, knowing that a lot of other people run into that made me feel less...weird? Like I feel weird telling people I had it for some reason because I don't want to make it seem like a big deal but fuck. I had to be on the same drip of magnesium the next day and could barely told Emma because it makes you feel like you've been hit by a dump truck. They've been monitoring me closer this pregnancy because of all that, just in case. Fun stuff!Also, fuck her doctor. Seriously. Mine is kinda like hers in the sense that our appointments are short and we keep things simple but I KNOW that she would listen to me if I had concerns like Knisley did. I was like shaking the book when I got to that part. You know that happens to so many other women, too. Like by now don't you think that people should trust the mom gut?!?! It's a real thing. ANYWAYYY, I digress. This turned into a pretty long winded review but it felt good to get some of that out. Basically, this is a really great and important read about pregnancy and even just the history of pregnancy, too (which...could be horrifying to read about lol). Definitely will be going to request ALL of her other graphic novels ASAP.For more of my reviews, please visit:"

        "user_review": "I always feel the same way when I finish a new Lucy Knisley book. It's so weird to have followed her since the very beginning of her career (through a stroke of luck, I've followed her blog from the beginning, before she published a book, because a friend also followed her), to essentially watch her life progress without having spoken a single word to her. (This is especially true since I started following her on Instagram after her son was born. She's been posting lots of comics about her finicky senior cat, Linney, lately, just as a public service announcement.)Because I followed her on Instagram, I was aware that she'd had a difficult pregnancy and birth, but until reading this, I wasn't aware quite how difficult.I've always been fascinated with sexuality and the reproductive system, much more so than my peers seemed to be. I remember reading medical texts for fun in the library and online as much as I could while my fellow fifth graders were playing kickball outside, or whatever. Honestly, if I wasn't so terrified of actually killing someone, I would have probably tried to become an OBGYN or midwife.Amusingly, Lucy Knisley seems to share my fascination, and like me, she regrets the lack of general education about pregnancy and women's health. I knew I was going to like this book before I even read it, but when I got to this panel, I was just like, yep:\"I've always wanted to know–how did it go?\" Me too!That's what this book is about, how it went for Lucy, and she talks openly about every aspect, including her difficulties in her pregnancy with Pal (this is a pseudonym she uses for him, short for Little Palindrome, because he was born on a palindromic day) and her miscarriages. There is actually a lot of talk about openness itself, and how even though miscarriage and other reproductive issues are so, so common, no one talks about them, and so nearly every pregnant person who experiences them feels isolated and alone. She tackles the experience of being in a medical system that dismisses patient concerns (Knisley had pre-eclampsia that escalated into eclampsia during labor, and though she noted all the symptoms to her doctor and was worried about them over the course of her pregnancy, he brushed her fears aside as irrelevant, and then she almost died). It was pretty visceral at times, but it was also funny and happy. Her fears and insecurities get just as much play as her excitement and joy over the impending birth of their son.That would have been enough for me enjoy the book, but it's also peppered with pregnancy facts throughout history, and some of them are fascinating, and some of them are terrifying. Modern medicine is not perfect, but it's a lot better than what they used to have, even 100 years ago!I know she will probably do a book about marriage or motherhood (or both) next, but I would like to nominate a book entirely about Linney the cat, instead, please (or in addition).[4.5 stars]"

        "user_review": "I have followed Knisley's work since she was in art school and I was a 12 year old on Livejournal. As i watched her grow as an artist and a person, I appreciated the way her scope grew with her—though as she has recently settled into heterosexual marriage with a software engineer, I have felt a prickle of annoyance at the insights she develops about the world. She seems perfectly nice, but also has become someone less likely to ask important questions. For example, I think Relish and An Age Of License function far better as memoirs than Something New, as a minutae-by-minutae look at heterosexual monogamy is less than thrilling to me.This book follows Knisley's journey toward parenthood, and while the qualms about her art and work I have generally persist, I think there should be more writing about the difficulties of pregnancy, more normalization of discussions of birth control, and a broader conversation about the horrific negligence of many doctors toward pregnant women. So I read it —and I think it does something worthwhile to bring up good conversations.It should be said that Knisley is still a white woman ill-equipped to tell the story of modern gynecology. She's a memoirist and not a researcher or historian, and it shows. For example, she references the violence toward enslaved black women in the name of science at the hands of James Marion Sims, but decides on not drawing any of these women—even in dignity , even just faces—or conducting more research about them or what their lives might have been like. Instead the women are a black censor bar that says \"nope not drawing this\" and Knisley depicts their tormenter looking dowdy but human (albeit with many curses around his head). She doesn't know or doesn't write about the 20th century campaigns of genocide against black woman and Latina women in the United States or elsewhere, or the conditions of women giving birth in incarceration, though she explores widespread fears of infertility and general decline in U.S birth rates. While she writes about doulas and midwives, she allows her view of natural birth to be influenced by the excruciating pain she was in during her own experience and doesn't make an effort to include perspectives or voices by other mothers. She also doesn't mention trans people, which wouldn't irk me except for the scene where she shows herself wondering \"what if men could get pregnant? Would gender exist?\" when men can and do get pregnant —and Knisley should know, since she dated a trans man in high school and outed him and his deadname in her first published book.In short—it's a memoir, beholden to the same limits as other memoirs by white well to do artists.But I think within her scope, Knisley does pretty well. She goes over her own complicated history with birth control, talks about the ways that sex ed and planned parenthood both educated her about her own body and failed her, and talks in depth about her miscarriages and final successful pregnancy. Her clean style makes each page easy to read. She notes the ways that different doctors made her uncomfortable, her devastating first trimester morning sickness, and the ways that her husband was impacted emotionally by what she was going through (I think she is too nice to him—I like John less after reading this book for making Lucy think it was necessary to give so much space to his anxieties about the responsibilities of parenthood for him as a dad when Lucy is enduring enormous physical trauma as a part of becoming a parent). She talks about the ways that her doctor ignored clear signs that she was experiencing pre-eclampsia and how her own research gave her information that was sometimes better , but how she felt as if she was not entitled to ask for a second opinion. I think this book could empower many pregnant people to seek more autonomy in their medical care leading up to birth. It also is just a comfort to have a graphic memoir about pregnancy. Something about illustrations makes a piece of media much more accessible.I appreciate the scenes centering on Knisley's experience of birth, as it dives into territory too often made mysterious, spiritual or murky and tries to elucidate its details and precise physicality—not in relation to the exit of her baby, but with regards to her epidural, her surgery, her painkillers, and the structure of her multiple hospital visits. The health care system and its failures loom large, and it is worth taking Knisley's experiences seriously."

With the historical horrors covered and the author's eye-popping experiences through conception, pregnancy, and birth, it seems like you would have to come face-to-face with your sadism to deny women their reproductive rights.I loved her layouts and am a fan of her simple illustration style, honest revelations, and informative content. It was especially poignant since I follow her on Instagram and see frequent videos and photos of adorable Pal, but now have an even deeper appreciation of all she went through to be his mom."

There aren't enough graphic memoirs about pregnancy out there, so I'm grateful to Knisley for sharing her story right when I needed it. I laughed, I cried, I related. Highly recommended for those who are expecting and need a break from the overwhelming crush of pregnancy fact books."

Lucy doesn't have an easy pregnancy or labor, so I'm just telling you that in advance. Otherwise, highly recommend!"

This was an intimate look at her personal journey to motherhood, but it included so much more! She effortlessly weaved in historical inaccuracies about women's health care, the history of childbirth, and pregnancy myths (the dangerous and the hilarious) as well as empowering all those who choose the path to parenthood. Some of my favorite parts involved her husband's reaction to her pregnancy and subsequent health scares. It gave me some empathy for what my husband will inevitably feel if we ever decide to expand our family. I loved this memoir, and I would highly recommend to anyone really, but especially to those who plan to be parents or already are parents."

Byłby mi bardzo potrzebny. Czasami ktoś pyta o książki dobre na prezent dla ciężarnych - od dziś nie polecam żadnych bliskościowych poradników, tylko ten komiks. Będę też miała swój schowany, żeby w odpowiednim momencie podsunąć dzieciom.\"9 miesięcy czułego chaosu\" to opowieść o próbach zajścia w ciążę, stratach, które są nieodłączną częścią życia, niedogodnościach ciążowych, trudnym porodzie - osobistych doświadczeniach na drodze do macierzyństwa autorki. Są one przerywane mini wykładami składającymi się z informacji, ciekawostek, rysów historycznych związanych z kobiecymi narządami płciowymi i rozmnażaniem człowieka. Jest bardzo uczciwy, rzetelny, zabawny, życiowy, wspierający i mądry. Pokazuje wiele perspektyw, jest tu ojciec, któremu też może być ciężko, jest o tym, że nie każdy musi chcieć mieć dziecko, jest o poronieniach jako czymś zupełnie naturalnym, ale jednocześnie bardzo trudnym.Wniósł też dużo nowych dla mnie informacji, często pokazanych przez patriarchalny pryzmat, a czasem zaskakujących - na przykład dopiero dziś dowiedziałam się, że ślinochrony dentystyczne służą za profilaktykę w trakcie seksu oralnego.Najbardziej jednak polubiłam w tej książce samą Lucy Knisley - jej świetne poczucie humoru i feministyczne szpileczki wbijane wielkim mężczyznom, poglądy i podejście do świata. Mogłaby być moją kumpelą. Chętnie przeczytałabym jej pozostałe komiksy.Serdecznie polecam."

In between the chapters are tangents dealing with the history of and general information about childbirth.As with her previous work, this was a delight to read. Knisley has a wonderfully clean, crisp style and a knack for showing just the right amount of detail to make the panels informative, but not overburdened. The story flows nicely, and the historical chapters were fascinating.I found myself wishing that this book existed back when my wife's and my child was born. Yes, we figured it all out in the end--all parents do--but it would have been nice to have known about a few things that Knisley talks about in advance.In the end, there's really not much more to say about this. Know only that, in a field ridiculously stuffed with autobiographical comics, Lucy Knisley's work stands out from the pack. Recommended!"

(I feel like I shouldn't say \"goddamn\" in a review of a children's book, but also I am still me. I still have my brand to look out for, regardless of target audiences.)A n y w a y. This book rules.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...I have a kind of complicated relationship with the movie. It has a reputation for being among the worst book-to-film adaptations, and that is, guess what, totally warranted. They're two totally different stories, essentially. But uh…(whispers) I guess that's kind of why/how I like them both?I GREW UP ON BOTH OF THEM OKAY. THEY'RE BOTH GOOD IF YOU LOOK AT THEM SEPARATELY.Ahem.Anyway. I say for the second time.This book, in case you live under a rock that prevents you from hearing about great middle-grade adventure retellings of fairytales with feisty female protagonists, is a Cinderella retelling wherein Cinderella (just Ella tho) has been cursed with obedience. She has to obey every command given to her.IT SUCKS.But it double-sucks because Ella is a lil badass and totally feisty and stubborn and would neverrrrr listen to anyone if she could help it. Unfortunately she cannot. But she gets into some fun hijinks and verbal battles and whatnot because of it.There is also Prince Char, who is an absolute BAAAAABE. One thing that no one can argue with in the movie is that the movie-Char is fine as hell. Pro tip: picture this for the rest of the review.The HAIIIIIIIR. Oh my god.Anyway. (Three times now. Stop counting.)Char's full name is Charmont, which is just one letter off from Charmant, which is the French word for charming. And he is EXTREMELY SO. A book boyfriend for the ages and the only man who could ever deserve Queen of Feist Ella.This should be enough to convince you that this book rocks and it is ten years past time for you to read it. Amazing badass female protagonist + dreamy love interest + great well-developed romance that starts as a friendship (which I didn't mention until this point but now you know) + adventurey exciting plot + curse + fairies + ogres + giants + fairytale lands + mythical creatures + elvin artists + Cinderella retelling = perfection.Okay, to be fair, I didn't include a lot of that information before now. But again:now you know.Bottom line: This book is like throwing a bunch of ingredients for perfection in a pot and hoping they stick. And guess what? THEY DO.----------------reread updatesjust as good on the 800th read----i will reread this book infinity times."

        "user_review": "Feminists often denounce traditional fairy tales because they perpetuate the ideals of a patriarchal society by encouraging girls to behave like proper princesses and wait for charming princes to take charge and save the day. In response to these traditional fairy tales, many authors have tried to reclaim the realm of fairy tales for girls. These retellings feature active protagonists who are not scared of taking charge and do not need princes to save them. One example of this new fairy tale genre is the 1998 children's novel \"Ella Enchanted\" by Gail Carson Levine, which takes an untraditional approach to retelling the story of Cinderella. The novel addresses several specific feminist issues, specifically negotiating and fighting the burden of obedience, the importance of female friendships and, of course, learning to save yourself.The story is set in an imaginary, medieval-esque kingdom called Frell. A roaming fairy named Lucinda gives Ella the gift/curse of obedience at Ella's birth. As a result, Ella has to do everything she is told, no matter what harm it might cause to herself or others. (In the novel, the severity of Ella's curse in constantly underscored with passages explaining how little control Ella has over her own life: \"If someone told me to hop on one foot for a day and a half, I'd have to do it. And hopping on one foot wasn't the worst order I could be given. If you commanded me to cut off my own head, I'd have to do it.\") As the plot moves forward Ella is compelled to leave home to try and find Lucinda and ask her to lift the curse. Along the way she also falls in love with Prince Char. For varying reasons, depending on the version, Lucinda refuses to lift the curse. Further difficulties arise as Ella continues her quest.That's the main body of the story. The Cinderella element is relevant mainly to the last quarter of the novel where actual elements from that story (the slipper, the ball) appear in the story, although the evil step-sisters and fairy godmother are present throughout the narrative.There are several reasons that I love this novel and recommend it to everyone. The first is that it's an imaginative retelling of Cinderella which makes the story exciting for readers familiar with the original version without making it too abtruse for readers who have never heard of Cinderella. Also, the book is full of great role models for girls. All of the female characters are strong, self-aware women--things seen far too rarely in the fairy tale genre. The novel is narrated in Ella's voice. This makes it easy to see how strong Ella is as a character (especially at the end of the novel).The other great thing about this book is that it all seems authentic, never over the top or under-written. In addition to creating immensely likable main characters, Levine creates a compelling world within the pages of \"Ella Enchanted\" vivid with details ranging from Elvish and Gnomish languages to customs at a Giant's wedding. The story is an immensely entertaining page-turner that will (even better) leave readers feeling satisfied when they reach the final scene where Levine ties everything together, artfully blending empowerment with a happy-ever-after ending fit for a traditional fairy tale.Excerpted from a scholarly article I wrote about Ella Enchanted as a book and movie.

        "user_review": "This book is so hard for me to review because I love every single thing about it, but hate every single thing aboutthat bloody movie.Like seriously, who decided to only use the names and the curse and rewrite everything else for the movie? Why did we need a talking snake and an evil uncle and a fan group for the prince? Wasn't evil Hattie enough?SERIOUSLY THIS STORY IS ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS AND PERFECT AND THE MOVIE RUINED IT, I CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH FOR YOUThere is no need for a fan club for the prince. There is no need for an evil uncle trying to take the throne or a big giant talking snake that literally has no purpose but to make you feel like you are watching a live action version of Disney's Robin Hood.It's even the little things. Like Mandy. She is suppose to be a ruffed-up old lady with crazy white hair and basically Ella's mother. Does this girl look like that?NO.Or that the stepmother and stepsisters are suppose to be fat.But really, I'm upset about the ogres.So in the perfect-little book, Ella has a knack for languages. Each creature has their own language and she knows bits and pieces of them from the talking birds at the market. Well the ogres have a knack for languages too, but when they speak (in whatever language they want to) you believe anything they say. You will do whatever they want you to do, because they are your best friend and they don't REALLY want to eat you.I thought the scene in the book with the ogres, which I am not going to spoil, wasabsolutely fascinating. AND THE MOVIE DIDN'T EVEN -- UGH.At least the prince was cute, right? That's a second thing they got right.The first being the Ella has the curse to obey every command ever pointed at her.Dig in, Ella. Run around, Ella. Cut off your head, Ella. Don't be friends with them, Ella. Be happy, Ella. Only speak in riddles, Ella. Hold your breath, Ella.That is absolutely nightmarish.Just take my word for it: If you ever are channel surfing and you see thisRun outside, grab that gasoline you save for when your lawnmower is low, throw it on your TV and light a match. It is absolutely insulting to this little gem.I love all the retellings that Gail Carson Levine does, and that movie does NO JUSTICE.I know I didn't really tell you anything about the book except that I liked it. But what else do you need to know besides it is a retelling of Cinderella and the \"Cinderella\" of the book has a curse to obey all commands ever? Isn't that interesting in itself? It's short and sweet, go read it."

        "user_review": "My daughters have watched the Disney movie Ella Enchanted many times and loved it immensely. They are enamored by the Disney princess genre, even princesses who do not fit nicely into the company's traditional definition of princess. Until last week, I had never viewed the film with them, being that I hardly fit the definition of girly girl myself, often opting for whatever sporting event is in season. I enjoyed the concept of a medieval Cinderella who is not necessarily forced to do back breaking work for an evil stepmother but to be obedient to her and whoever else orders her around. Seeing the film version, lead me to this Newberry award winning book by Gail Carson Levine.At birth, Ella of Prell is gifted by the fairy Lucinda to always be obedient at all costs. Growing up, she once had to eat an entire birthday cake, nearly relinquish a toddler gnome to an ogre, and lose more friends than she ever made, only because someone had ordered her to do so. Unable to tell anyone of her curse, Ella appears deceptive to the world, often times leading her to lead a solitary life.As in the traditional Cinderella story, Ella's mother dies when she is fifteen years old. At her mother's funeral, she stays out of sight in case someone orders her to do something and she is too sad to be obedient. At this trying time in her life, she meets Prince Char of Kyrria for the first time, and he is instantly smitten with her, leading to a lengthy quest of his over the course of the book to win her hand in marriage. Although not instantly enamored, Ella over time realizes what her curse could do to Char and his kingdom, and seeks out Lucinda to take back this curse once and for all.Unlike the movie, there is no shopping mall, protest, soundtrack, or evil uncle and his pet snake waiting to take over the kingdom. In Levine's original version we do meet Areida of Ayortha, Mandy the fairy godmother, and Dame Olga and her atrocious daughters Hattie and Olive. In addition to them, we meet a traditional medieval cast of elves, gnomes, ogres, and giants. All these people and other beings play a role in Ella's curse, making for a memorable book for middle grade readers.As a mother of girls, I enjoyed that the Ella in the book is a heroine for all beings regardless of their place in society. She is assertive and is not subservient to her prince as the traditional Disney Cinderella is. In this modern retelling, Ella alone seeks out to reverse the curse cast upon her by Lucinda, making her a strong heroine character for girls. The movie was fun yet Disneyfied, but Gail Carson Levine's book version of Ella Enchanted is a fun, strong read and worthy of its Newberry, rating a solid 4 stars."

        "user_review": "Now I know why people made such a fuss when the movie came out. I watched the movie first, so I had no idea how utterly wrong everything was. It totally is not like the book. Just slap on the names and the curse and that's where the similarities end. I must say the book isMUCHbetter than the movie.The style of the writing was kind of weird for me, but not in a bad way. It's not that it was too fast paced or anything, but I noticed there wasn't a lot of padding or fanfare before events would happen, which I usually expect from fantasy books. The writing style worked in this story since it seemed to fit the main character to a tee.I absolutely loved the story. It's a great way of showing how the only one who can save you is you, and you have to find the strength within to do it. Sometimes it takes someone else to bring that strength out of you and that's what Char does for Ella unknowingly.The magic book was a nice touch and added what the other characters were thinking without actually changing the narrator of the story. I couldn't give the book 5 stars because it seemed odd to me how she dealt with her mother's death. It's like after awhile it doesn't seem to matter, which I guess makes sense since the book isn't really about her grieving for her mother. The story is really about how her death makes Ella have to face her demons by throwing her the different situations she finds herself in. Still, it really isn't that bothersome because of course you see that Ella misses her mother at times.This is the best version of the Cinderella story I have encountered. All and all a very worth while read."

        "user_review": "❌ My advice to you: The movie and the book are two very separate and different things. So when you start reading this book, don't compare it with the movie. Don't even think about the movie at all while you're reading this.Do that, and you'll enjoy this book immensely.On the day she was born,Ella of Frellwas given the gift of obedience by the foolish and careless fairy,Lucinda.Obedience. It was a gift.Well, for starters...Ella, Hold your tongueKiss me.Erhh...well, that's not such an unpleasant order **coughs** but uhh yeah. You get the point. It was the curse of compulsion. One which couldn't be overcome. Delayed, maybe, but even that came with a high price. Physical side effects, very unpleasant side effects. This was a new spin on one of the most recycled fairy tales that's ever been told. This is not a book to be analyzed. It's just a really great story, and to add to that, it was delivered in a wonderful way, with bold, and engaging writing.JUST ANOTHER CINDERELLA STORY⏩ An evil step mother⏩ Butt-ugly deranged and bossy step sisters⏩ A handsome and wonderful Prince⏩ Maltreatment, sabotage and trickery⏩ A ball⏩ More sabotage and trickery⏩ A pair of glass slippers⏩ And some fairy magicTHE EXTRAS❎ A magical book for spying on people.❎ A diverse and magical land of Ogres, Giants, and Elves. Sorry mouse people.❎ An established relationship between Cinderella and the Prince before the night of the ball. I'm sorry, but I just never understood it. Cinderella spent one night with a guy and bada-boom boom! Love ⏩ Marriage ⏩ Happily ever after? I'm sorry honeyThat's why I respectAriel(well, really, the Disney version of Ariel),Princess Jasmine,andBellemost of all, at least they spent some time with their guys before hitching those rides. Between Ella and Charmont, letters were written, ideas were exchanged, and thoughts were shared. First came friendship, and then came love. All I can say is: How I loved those letters!❎ Ella's a girl with a little spunk. A heroine to love, admire, and adore.Well she never said that. But she never took an order placidly. And of course, she took her revenge - revenge. Ha! How could I not love her? - whenever she could. After all, it's pure logic:You said get me a drink. You never said don't spit in it.❎ Lots of adventure and action. This book is looking for someone -people- to share an adventure with. We join Ella as she embarks on a quest, to find a way to get rid of her curse. Take it from me, it was a wonderful experience.❎ Happily ever after. Let's face the truth. A fairy tale won't be as magical without a happily ever after. I won't even lie. I love it! You do too."

        "user_review": "\"It is helpful to know the proper way to behave, so one can decide whether or not to be proper.\"I feel like this is a confession that I will regret making. I was a fan of the movie *hides* This is my first time readingElla Enchantedand now I understand why everyone hates the film!Ella Enchantedis what every great middle-grade novel should be. Great adventures, obstacles to over-come, engaging characters and a little magic. This book pulled all of these things well.Ella Enchantedis a retelling of the beloved fairy taleCinderella, which is a personal favorite of mine. This is a much more modern adaption of the tale, there is no insta-love here. The book is a very short and fast read - I enjoyed every minute of it. I'd been meaning to read a book by Gail Carson Levine for awhile now and it looks like this was the perfect place to pick to discover her writing. I'm 100% going to be reading more of her work.I adored the character of Ella. Yes, she had a curse on her where she had to obey whatever anyone said to her. Obviously this could ruin someone's life or get them killed but she rebelled against it as hard as she could. It even caused her pain resisting the requests that were harmful to her. She wasn't the best at keeping her secret about the curse, even if she never directly came out and said it. It was pretty obviously to anyone who was demanding. Still, she tried her hardest to have her own ideas, her own independence and her own life really. She was kind but believable and she could be immature - like every girl her age should be from time to time.I loved the her love interest Prince Char - he was genuinely interested in everything she had to say and found her to be the most amazing person he had ever met. He was friends with her for a long time first before confessing his feelings and he was 100% dedicated to her. He was basically a sweetheart.Yes, Ella and Char were a little young to be talking about marriage but we aren't talking about modern times here - they were just at the right age in a different century. They did feel like very young characters but they were young characters so I appreciated that they didn't try to make them act like they were 25 or something . They talked exactly how you might suspect someone of their age doing so. It was completely endearing and adorable.Loved all the side characters, even Lucinda was fun to me. I loved that most of the characters evolved through the story and some did not. Great storytelling.I will quickly address the movie that was based off this book. I saw the movie that stars Anne Hathaway many moons ago and really enjoyed it. It was really cheesy, not that well-done and all-around silly. However, there was something charming about it - maybe because I really liked the lead actors but the movie was comforting and safe to me and I loved that about it. You could just let your brain shut down and watch something mindless. Is this worth a watch if you've grown up on the book? NO, so much NO. Yes, I enjoyed the film and still do. However, I never grew up with the book and after reading it, I now know why fans are so harsh on the film. The film has almost nothing to do with the story. The characters are 100% different - they tried to modernize it and they added in new plots that aren't nearly as good as the ones in the original series. Basically, avoid the film.Obviously, I highly recommend this to a younger audience or for someone like me, who is young at heart!"

        "user_review": "I never liked Cinderella as a kid. It seemed like whenever she got into trouble, her best plan was to burst into tears and wait for someone to come along and help her. I also wondered, even if she couldn't leave her stepmother's house, could she at least tell the awful woman to go make her own damn breakfast once in a while? As far as little cynical-as-hell Madeline was concerned, Cinderella was a spineless twinkie who was painfully useless.Obviously, I am not the only girl who had a problem with the fairy tale, and fortunately, Gail Carson Levine decided to do something about it. Her Cinderella (Ella of Frell) is smart, stubborn, and pretty damn feisty. Her only problem is that when she was born, a well-meaning fairy gave her the gift of obedience. Ella has to obey any direct order given to her, no matter what. So, naturally, she sets out to find the fairy, lift the curse, get rid of her stepmother and stepsisters, and maybe even end up with Prince Char. (Char as in Charmont, geddit?) A lovely story, and much better than anything Disney could come up with."

        "user_review": "This still stands as one of my favorite books. The fantasy elements are clever and not too over the top. Ella is witty and pretty clever herself, not to mention strong and determined and resourceful. Mandy is just your everyday, ordinary, regular old cook/fairy. Char is, appropriately, charming. The stepsisters are deliciously evil. Lucinda is completely batty.I like that none of the women in the book are doormats. Good or evil, protagonist or minor background character, they have an opinion, they exert at least some control over their own destiny, they are quietly secure in the knowledge of their own power.The movie was terrible, folks, so don't go by that. (Anne Hathaway, why must you insist in being in movies that ruin my favorite kids books?)"

I think it was mean.\"\"It probably was mean.\" (We've had a lot of problems with Kate bossing and teasing lately, but my daughter is always anxious to give Kate the benefit of the doubt).After a moment's thought, my daughter said, \"It's like Ella Enchanted - how she has to listen to mean people and do what they say. Only I don't have to listen to Kate or do what she says because I don't have a spell cast on me like Ella does. I'm not going to listen to Kate anymore. I'll still be nice, but I'm going to step back.\"Thank you, Gail Carson Levine, for crafting an empowering story for girls, and for helping my daughter see, through the lens of Ella's experiences, that always trying to conform to others can be like living with a curse."

        "user_review": "A unique retelling with some truly surprising plot twists. Quite different from the other Gail Carson Levine's fairy tale retellings that I have read. Ella Enchanted and more lush writing style and less deliberately comical and stilted interactions and it possessed quite an enjoyable style.Shock of all shocks - my favorite part of the book was undoubtedly the romance (I know. You don't see me say that in a review very often!). The relationship between Char and Ella was sweet and well developed and a highlight of the book. I thought Ella's sacrifice love for Char and her resolution to protect him from herself was very poignant and believable.The other element that stood out to me was Ella herself. At last – a rebellious character that makes sense and actually has a reason for being rebellious! Ella is definitely not a placid Cinderella and fights back against her tormentors with a stubbornness that almost borders on the heroic. This was really a brilliant bit of characterization and kept the book from being overwhelming disturbing (which it would have been if Ella had been taking all the abuse without a murmur) and gave me a feisty non-annoying heroine I could actually root for. For once!Ella Enchanted also contained some nice world building that still retained a streak of Levine's signature zaniness and pacing moved along at a good clip and kept me turning the pages quickly to see what happened next.But in spite of all this . . . when I closed the book I found it forgettable. It's not a book that I'd treasure or a new favorite—I'm not even sure I'd read it again. For some reason, this book wasn't one that stayed in my mind or claimed a permanent part of my emotions.Perhaps it was because I felt slightly worn after reading Ella Enchanted. I found Ella's situation pretty stressful and much of the book focused on her impossible and worrying situation and her families endless abuse. Obviously, people taking advantage of Ella's *gift* was what the story was about, but I found it genuinely stressful at points to read. However, I have read other stress-producing books that I loved so I still can't quite articulate what ingredient this book was missing to make me like it more. I really wish I had loved this book more than I did – and I suspect that missing element shall puzzle me for some time.Overall – an enjoyable book, though.Content: Ella is taken advantage of constantly by cruel people. Some magic and a few eye-rolling moments with the infatuated Ella admiring Char's physicality – the hairs on the back of his neck, for one. *SNORTS*"

        "user_review": "It's a sweet, humorous book, written for a younger audience but easily enjoyed by an older one too. Based on the Cinderella story, there are a few notable differences, namely that Ella was \"blessed\" with the \"gift\" of obedience by the fairy Lucinda, who thinks all her gifts (such as turning you into a squirrel) are wonderful. Ella is the daughter of Lady Eleanor and a somewhat unscrupulous merchant, Sir Peter, whom she rarely sees. She grows up with her mother, who teaches her to slide down the banister, and the cook Mandy, who's not all she seems. She learns fairly early what a curse the gift is, where any command must be obeyed. The opportunities for being taken advantage of are mind-boggling (but strictly G-rated). Ella learns to be defiant even while she is forced to obey, but the trick doesn't always work.When, at fifteen, her mother dies several things happen. Firstly, she meets Prince Char and forms a friendship with him, and secondly her father decides to send her to finishing school along with the two hideous daughters of Dame Olga, who has her sights set on Sir Peter. The daughters, Hattie and Olive, are greedy, rude and obnoxious, but things become worse when Hattie realises Ella must obey her.Ella is desperate to find Lucinda and have her remove the curse, which leads her to run away from the finishing school and into all sorts of trouble. Unlike a lot of fantasy stories, though, this one isn't a quest story set on an endless road. Ella meets Elves and is nearly eaten by Ogres, but spends most of the story at home. Humorous escapades and a blooming friendship between her and Char balance out the cruelty dealt her by others. And the Cinderella aspect is given full due, but in a refreshing way. The similarities are there, but it never feels old and tired and same-y.Also, Ella herself is a great heroine, smart and strong but not over-confident or perfect. She's a bit clumsy but has the gift of imitating languages and voices, and learning languages quickly. She's no defenceless damsel and she doesn't whinge, but her curse curtails who she really is. The moral of the story is fitting, but not lecturing. Levine has a much lighter hand than your average Disney movie, and there's not a saccharine moment. It reminds me a bit of the movieEver After, so if you liked that then you'll like this book, and vice versa.A joy to read, and very well written,Ella Enchantedtook up a few hours of my time but will take up a much larger slice of my memory: for making me laugh at the end of an exhausting week, for being sweet but not cloying, wise but not preachy, and for revitalising an old fairytale."

        "user_review": "\"And so, with laughter and love, we lived happily ever after.\"So What's It About?Ella of Frell is given a terrible \"gift\" by a foolish fairy when she is a baby- she must always be obedient when given a command. She grows up struggling against the crushing constraints of her curse but relatively happy and beloved by her mother and cook. Her world is upended by her mother's death, and the changes that follow.Nasty stepsisters, boarding school nonsense, sweet-talking trolls and fairy fickleness only brush the surface of the adventures that are in store for Ella as she struggles against her challenging new circumstances and her curse. Of course, there is a prince in the mix as well, and while their friendship grows into something more the dangers of Ella's existence have never been more apparent. It will take every bit of this heroine's resolve to find her happily ever after!The F WordI disliked the last fairy tale retelling I read because of the way the author failed to successfully capture the beloved message that is at the heart of Beauty and the Beast: love people for what's on the inside, not the outside. When considering Cinderella for this review, however, I struggled a bit in deciding what the moral of the original story even is. Have small feet? Wait for a man to sweep you away out of servitude? It's…a little less clear. Let's settle for a generic \"Goodness (especially in the face of adversity) is always rewarded.\"The thing that makes Ella Enchanted one of my favorite fairy tale retellings is that the clever and seamless incorporation of Ella's curse provides the story a much bulkier message for young readers: one about the importance of free will and the control that others will always try to exert over us, and the fact that sufficient determination to do the right thing will prevail against even the most improbable odds. These are the truths at the hearts of Ella's story, and it just so happens that they are presented in the midst of a story that is indescribably magical and charming.The central appeal of this book to me is Ella herself. She's simply one of the most lovable narrators I've ever encountered – spunky in a way that is genuinely endearing as opposed to annoying, endlessly clever and resourceful, capable, hilarious, charming and independent. You may remember similar praises for Aerin in The Hero and the Crown and Cimorene in Dealing With Dragons, and that's because these girls (along with a few others we'll be talking about soon enough…) truly shaped my conception of who I wanted to be when I was younger.Ella's struggle for agency is always the book's central concern. What's more, she breaks her own curse through her own determination and selflessness -and it should be noted that she breaks it by refusing to marry the prince who proposes to her. It makes me a little weepy to write about this because it's JUST TEACHING GIRLS SO MANY THINGS- that their ability to make choices and think for themselves is their path to freedom, that there will always be people who will try to take these things away but they can be overcome, that they can find power in saying no.But there's one glaring exception to this book's generally empowering and positive nature, and that is its completely on-the-nose treatment of the ugly stepsisters. It's frustratingly regressive to argue that a girl being \"ugly\" outside (read: usually, unwilling or unable to conform to narrow and misogynistic beauty standards that emphasize looks above all else) is a bad thing or is correlated in any way with being a bad person and/or therefore unwanted and unloved. Hattie and Olive are spiteful and cruel people, and that should be enough on its own – why do we have to mock the way they look as well?I'd also like to mention that Ella Enchanted is otherwise bursting with charm and color at every turn. Enchanting descriptions abound – everything from the tiny pottery castle her father sells to Ella's magic self-replenishing book, her beautiful dresses for each ball to the food that she cooks with Mandy the cook/ fairy godmother. There are also delightful creatures: tiny dragons who toast cheese with their noses, gnomes who tell the future, waxy green elves who sleep under the stars and docile centaurs.The other main thing that I need to yell about vis a vis this book is the giant, embarrassing crush that wee little Charlotte had on Prince Char. He seemed like the perfect boy™ to 8 year old me, what can I say!!!! Re-reading as an adult, I am delighted to inform you that Char is a Good Good Boy, and I suffer no regrets regarding my childhood infatuation. He's a sweet, kind person and the development of Ella's friendship and romance with him is adorable – the letters they exchange, abandoning a ball to search for hidden walls, giving apples to centaurs and -who could forget!-sliding down staircase banisters\"No one is here,\" Char said. \"You need resist temptation no longer.\"\"Only if you slide too.\"\"I'll go first so I can catch you at the bottom.\"He flew down so incautiously that I suspected him of years of practice in his own castle. It was my turn. The ride was a dream, longer and steeper than the rail at home. The hall rose to meet me, and Char was there. He caught me and spun me around.\""

Ella's gift is of obedience which turns out to be a curse in many ways and Ella gets into trouble sometimes because of it and sometimes it has nothing to do with the gift.It is a fun story that had me laughing out loud throughout. I didn't like Ella at first but she grew on me as the story progressed. It is similar to the traditional story but it is also very different and I actually liked the Prince's character better in this.4 stars"

I'm gonna give the girl a backstory like you wouldn't believe! and it's going to be cute, and funny, and there will be all kinds of mythical creatures in it! It's going to be wholly other-worldly! And she's going to go on this awesome journey that's going to be epic and life changing!\"All that ended halfway through the book: The journey, the special creatures, the seemingly important gifts and details, the developmental steps... all gone. And then the author thought to herself, \"Oh wait...this is supposed to be Cinderella. Um..let's see...her father remarries...her stepfamily hates her...turns her into a slave...glass slippers...the prince has a ball...glass slippers...they get married...The end!\"So really the book is two stories. The totally awesome cool story that the author started with...and the cliche, not-at-all-revamped Cinderella story that she ended with.And for Goodness Sakes! WHAT WAS WITH THE ELVES GIFTS?! She made it seem so damn important that we should know about these gifts and all the way through the novel Ella is hiding them and they're special and they're everything her father ever wanted...What happens to them?!We don't know!She kept them in a bag for the rest of her life!AND THE NECKLACE?! I thought for sure that was going to be the key to everything! It was special and important when it was introduced. it was an heirloom. It was gnome-made (gnomes are magic). It's stolen from her. She wants it back. She contemplates getting it back...Then for the next hundred pages, it's never mentioned, but suddenly at the end of the book, *poof* she has it back. All is well. The End.GAH!I still enjoyed the book, but good grief, make a tighter story, Lady!by the way:Prince CharmingPrince Charmonte...hmmm....I don't like that kind of blaring twist on cliches."

        "user_review": "My sister recommended this book to me and even bought me a copy at half price day at Goodwill. Now I am recommending this book to you.The main character, Ella, is a young woman, almost 15, who is cursed with obedience as an infant. A fairy thinks she's blessing the baby by forcing her to be obedient, but that's not really how it turns out. Imagine being physically compelled to doanythingthatanyonetells you to do. You don't have to be an anarchist to quickly realize that would be a rotten way to live.Thankfully, Ella is intelligent, clever, witty, and gifted with languages.After a family tragedy, the previously sheltered Ella is forced out into the world where she goes on a quest to find the fairy who cursed her and ask for relief from her burden.Two-thirds of the way through, the book becomes the retelling of the classic Cinderella story. At first I was nervous that the great beginning of the book would be ruined by this quirky turn, but it actually worked out really well.Gail Carson Levine is a gifted writer, and I enjoyed this story immensely. I recommend this book for little girls and really anyone all into \"someday my prince will come\" and \"happily ever after.\" This feisty heroine will be an inspiration to everyone who reads her story"

        "user_review": "such a lovely, gentle fantasy! i read this slowly, usually just a few chapters before bed, and it was a very comforting experience.it's an interesting retelling because the classic cinderella is also endlessly obedient, though she doesn't have a curse on her like ella. she's obedient because of feminine socialization and cultural expectations. this book is wonderful for naming inescapable obedience a curse, as it is.something i noticed (perhaps because i've been learning techniques for reparenting my inner child) is that ella is so good at self-soothing and seeking out comfort. she's essentially been orphaned, but she knows small ways to make herself feel cared for. when she visits the elves, she sees the elf nursery where adults play flutes and rock the hammocks of baby elves. and later, alone, she rocks her own hammock to help her sleep 🥺 taking care of one's inner child is such a strong, resilient thing to do, and i love that ella models it for readers.i also love the inclusion of different languages! it's a powerful way to enrich the worldbuilding. and i love seeing ella become a skilled linguist as she interacts with more people who speak different languages.overall, it's a wonderfully vibrant, layered retelling with a soft, soothing tone despite its occasional darkness. cinderella has never been my favorite fairytale, and i've never been interested in the movie adaptation ofella enchanted, but i adored reading this!"

        "user_review": "3.5'Women Don't Owe You Pretty' is advertised as an \"accessible leap into feminism\" and it is exactly that. I already know the majority of stuff Florence Given talks about here, but it was great to be reminded of certain things and be introduced to a couple of new ones that made me think. It's a fantastic book that's well written, easy to read and beautifully illustrated, but I definitely have some problems with it.1. Florence spends far too much time talking about the male gaze. Yes, it's important and is basically the point of feminism. However, Florence is a bisexual woman, like myself, and I was disappointed to find that she doesn't spare much thought for the female gaze. There was a brief mention of the \"queer gaze\" but she didn't really talk about what that enails/how exactly it differs from the male gaze. I think this could've been a valuable addition to the book, especially as it's constantly her being like \"DON'T TAKE CRUMBS FROM MEN\" (a valid notion).2. She covers SO many different things, some more briefly than others, but she doesn't really talk about class. It's mentioned in passing towards the end of the book. Very suspicious, but not a massive flaw by any means.3. The terms \"gaslighting,\" \"emotional manipulation\" and \"abuse\" are thrown around throughout the book in a way that overuses and misuses them. I think she needs to be more mindful of how young and impressionable her audience is (Florence is only 21 herself) because these careless simplifications are everywhere. I think her book aims to cover complex realities, but she does stumble into some black and white ideas and also often presents her opinions as absolute facts (something she also does on Instagram)."

She somehow said a lot without saying very much at all?The one point she made that I firmly disagreed on, is the opinion that Social Media can take the place of a formal education. It's true, formal education isn't for everyone. However, Instagram captions can't take the place of reading and digesting information in a more formalised way.I think the reason I found myself disliking this book so much was that it felt like a collection of snappy Instagram captions. There was nothing for me to sink my teeth in, and I felt a distinct lack of references.I don't think I'm the intended audience for this book, as I already hold views as radical as the ones Florence expresses here. Therefore, to me, they weren't particularly radical at all and didn't break any fresh ground. Considering I was reading A Room of One's Own by Virgina Woolf concurrently, this book had an uphill battle to impress me as a feminist text.3 stars as I can imagine people finding this useful and radical, it's just not for me."

Unfortunately, Given rarely offered any solutions for her claims, and I feel like things were sugar coated, instead of facing issues head on.Nobody likes it when issues are deliberately avoided, like they are some kind of taboo. This is not the message to send out to people.The content of this book was feminism, sure, but at it's weakest. The author didn't talk about anything new or groundbreaking here. Yes, I was nodding as I read chapters, but only because I've heard it all before.Given is a repetitive writer, and she threw in many words, over and over which became pretty samey. I agreed with some points Given makes, but some are extremely questionable, especially when she considers herself to be a feminist.For example: Given thinks we should cut people out of our lives who makes a mistake. We're human, we all make mistakes, and anyway, isn't that how we can learn and progress? She speaks in command style writing, too.Don't get married!Don't desire a partner!Get rid of people that make mistakes!Buy a vibrator and give yourself constant orgasms!It sometimes felt like an aggressive tone, and almost like a person should feel guilty if she did want to get married, or want to have sex.Oh, and don't talk to the author about men. It's blindingly obvious how she feels about those."

        "user_review": "I found some chapters of this book incredibly empowering and relatable but certain parts of it didn't sit well with me. For me the chapters on marriage and dating seemed slightly patronising as someone in a long term relationship. I appreciate the sentiment behind them; realising your worth and not subjecting yourself to toxic relationships but the whole 'dump him' doesn't sit well with me. Maybe that's something I need to work on within my self? It's a weird one because I definitely learnt some valuable lessons reading this book, it reaffirmed a lot of feelings for me and I LOVED a lot of the chapters but certain parts of it definitely felt supercilious to me."

I assume, being 21 and able to work freelance/influencer/author that she must be fairly affluent, however she gives very little attention to this"

Ich habe mir Textstellen markiert und das Lesen des Buchs hat mir definitiv etwas gegeben. Schade finde ich jedoch, dass Florence Given sich auf einige feministische Theorien (zb die Gender-Theorie von Judith Butler) bezieht, ohne anzugeben, worauf (oder auf wen) ihre Aussagen basieren. Besonders im Zusammenhang mit den Plagiatsvorwürfen, die zusätzlich um dieses Buch kursieren, sehe ich das kritisch. Daher finde ich die Aussagen an sich sehr wichtig, aber eben nicht originell - schwierig zu bewerten😅"

Das Lesen hat mich enorm in meinem eigenen Denken weitergebracht, ich kann es jedem nur ans Herz legen, auch wenn man sich mal an der eigenen Nase packen und Fehler eingestehen muss. Ich habe wahnsinnig viel über mich und die (teils sehr toxische) Gesellschaft gelernt, was mir extrem die Augen geöffnet hat.Selten habe ich in einem Buch so oft zum Textmarker gegriffen.Die Inhalte sind immens wichtig, auch wenn sie manchmal unbequem sind.Absolute Herzensempfehlung!"

        "user_review": "Update (Jan 2021)After discovering that this author lifted and plagiarized the work of Chidera Eggerue (theslumflower), i am taking my review down from a 4 to a 1.To be clear, I also don't support Chidera, as she's also been accused of stealing work and experiences from sex workers, so I don't recommend reading her books either......I know I say this for a lot of the books I read, but this is a VERY IMPORTANT book. Florence Given explores a lot of themes from feminism and patriarchy to the gender binary and sexuality. In this book, she also discusses relationships and red flags, loving yourself and being enough, and also checking yourself.My review and words will hardly be enough to do this book justice, so I advice that you pick this up and read for yourself to understand how good it is. Content and trigger warnings for sexual harassment and rape. I really love that she put a content warning before every chapter that delved into these issues.I really enjoyed this one. I love reading books and essay collections about feminism. At first, I thought this book was just another repackaged book with the same words I've heard and read over and over again, but the author adds her unique perspective to this one in the form of the issues she talks on. She checks a lot of privilege in this book and I think it's important for everyone to read this book!The title essay, Women Don't Owe You Pretty, is one of the main themes over the book, and she discusses, time and again, the pressure and effects of fitting to the male gaze. I enjoyed her narration so so much!"

It is sold as an introduction to feminism for the instagram generation which I would agree with, and obviously empowering young women is always a positive thing. I loved the beginning talking about \"not accepting crumbs, you deserve the whole cake\" and felt like this was going to be a new favourite. Also the whole self-love vibe is completely up my street.However. Florence is only 20, and this shows in some ways. Her statement that following more diverse people on Instagram is worth more your time than going to university was coming from someone who has probably never been to university, and could be harmful to young people's prospects if followed. She makes assumptions about hetero relationships when she acknowledges she has only been in one. That women are expected to do the housework, because she was expected to in her one relationship, and that women are always expected to purchase contraception. Both of these came across as something she has decided is correct for all hetero couples because of her experience; instead of including research she might have done to support her arguments or even her friends experiences being included.On the whole, a definite positive reading experience, and would recommend to someone constantly in toxic relationships and not looking out for their own best interests. But would hesitate to buy for a young impressionable person."

There are a few topics that are discussed with very little nuance and some words are flung around in a way that verges on lazy at times, like 'emotional abuse'. My only other gripe is that some chapters are really short - one is 2 pages long if you don't include the artwork."

It just felt like an amalgamation of other feminist theories interspersed with 'feminist' self help tips. Nothing new or useful for me, but perhaps that's because I have spent years educating myself in this regard? Maybe, if I knew nothing about feminism, this would have appealed to me more? But as it is, that was not the case.👎 What I Disliked 👎Unoriginal: This was just one big soup of everything slightly feminist. It really didn't bring anything new to the table. It drew on different theories, self-help tips and sayings. I think it was meant to be inspirational and eye opening - and it might have been. If I hadn't read all of this somewhere else (and better written at that, too).Self-help: Honestly, this felt, most of all, like a self-help book. Meant to help you realise your full potential. Not a bad aim, sure. Just not what I wanted at all from this book. And it was not what I needed either, so it just didn't hit me in any profound way.Repetitive: There were just too few points that were re-worded and repeated time and time again throughout this book. It felt like reading the same mantra over and over.ARC provided by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest reviewFollow me for more book loving content!Blog✨Facebook✨Instagram✨TwitterBlog Post: 15 Books to Read if You Love Jane Austen"

I cannot recall anything else from this book that cost me thirty bloody dollars. If you're going to read this, go to the library.Reading some of the reviews, I agree with the line of thought that this book is sort of a little too late to the party. If it had been written around 2013, the time of bad feminist and everyday sexism, I could have perhaps gotten behind its fun and colourful energy.But 2021 Monica was not here for it.I think Florence has a lot to give and has great potential but 'women don't owe you pretty'...it's a no from me."

As a semi-seasoned feminist, this book was still great for me despite this being (without sounding snooty) below my usual level of feminist readings. Complete with beautiful illustrations, this book helped change my perspective on things such as self care and marriage. A timely, gorgeously accessible text for all ages, genders and stages of learning.However, my criticisms would be: there is a lot of repeated sentiments that could have been more condensed. Also, there is some misinformation. For example, body hair removal for women DID NOT originate in 1915, and rather met its origins in the ancient Islamic world. Also, there is a misuse of the term 'intrusive thought'. Intrusive thoughts do NOT apply to thoughts of internal misogyny - they are specific to mental health conditions such as OCD. This could have easily been rectified by an editor, so I'm questioning why this wasn't. Also, I don't like her assertion that ghosting is a form of emotional abuse. This statement lacked clarification and nuance - I expected better but u expect this was done in ignorance rather than malice.However, this doesn't take away from the fact this is a phenomenal text!"

        "user_review": "This book began with several problems for me, and the best chapters come toward the end. First, I wasn't fond of the portrayal of women in the book as always housewives or working women who were toppled by their ambition, who then become housewives. I couldn't decide if this was because Thomas's own wife was a housewife and so that was the male-female relationship he could best speak about (which seems reasonable), or if he very firmly holds to a complementarian view of men and women (which often is a tricky business to me). Relatedly, the book is written from a masculine standpoint, and often seems to be written to men. That is not to say women can't gain insights from the book, merely that the male voice within the book is unmistakable.Otherwise, the book struck me as peculiar in its relationship to advice. There are many great single lines and lessons that can engage the reader on a practical level. I was impressed with a lot of the passages about how sometimes God calls us to humble ourselves and choose to be the better person even if we're not getting back at the time in a marriage, not only for the sake of a better marriage or to get along with a partner, but simply because God often commands us to love unconditionally without getting it in return. This was an obvious lesson, but very profound to me (perhaps because I'm always terrified of giving more than I get). At the same time, because the book refuses to be another \"10 Steps to a Happy Marriage\" book, it offers little advice, especially not until the end, for how to handle conflict. The book readily admits couples will not always get along and sometimes things will even be unfair, but it does not offer a good solution for how to toe the line between addressing your needs so that your partner can fulfill them (which it says you should do) and understanding when things aren't going to go your way and humbly deciding to love your partner anyway (which it also says to do, for God's sake).Thomas's main thesis, which is simply that marriage, before anything else, is not designed necessarily to make us happy but instead to make us grow in God, was compelling. I can see how other reviewers could think (as I did at parts) that he seems to push this point too hard, instead forgetting the joys, delight, and companionship that marriage can bring. At the same time I think it is an important message that is often lost in these times. Christian or not, a marriage is a commitment to make something as permanent as humanly possible, so it requires commitment in the face of much ugliness and adversity. Having seen poor marriages, it is clear to me that not all marriages are an idyllic state, even if we like them to be. Even the best marriages go through trying times. For those people, or during those times, Thomas's message is one of hope, showing that even in the worst moments we are engaged in an important project not just for the betterment of our partners but ourselves and our relationship with God.While I do not regret having read this book as a young woman soon to enter into marriage, I definitely think the audience is meant to be already married couples who find themselves disillusioned by the commitment they've entered. You're going to find advice for addressing the partner you have, not finding a better one or somehow changing him or her. Likewise, if you're looking for easy steps to fix your marriage, don't read this, because there aren't any. If you're looking for food for thought in helping you understand and define the nature of the commitment you've made as well as what can make you stronger within it, then check out this book."

        "user_review": "For the first time in four or five years, I did a Bible Study this summer that wasn't an inductive study. To be quite honest, I was a bit fearful that I would hate doing a book study. I can't stand \"how to\" books and really hate being led by the nose to a specific conclusion. (Issues with authority, you think?) So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself really enjoy this book. Here's why:#1) This isn't a how to book. Instead of giving us a list of things to do to make our marriages better, Thomas encourages us to don new glasses in viewing our marriages. When we choose to do this, we can see our marriage not for what we gain from it, but for how it can shape and change us to be more like Christ.#2) This book is readable. Our group read two chapters each week and I found I could usually read the most of the two chapters in one treadmill session (roughly 30 minutes).#3) While the book is readable, it is still thought-provoking. Two chapters each week were plenty to read and ponder. Whether I'm reading fiction or non-fiction, I like a book that makes me think. This book not only made me think, it made me thankful for the marriage I have and made me take concrete steps to ease small frustrations I might have with my mate.#4) This book has stayed with me. I finished the book a few weeks ago and honestly didn't even think about reviewing it until yesterday. What prompted me to reconsider were conversations with two separate friends about how good I think this book is. One friend shared her challenges to regain her footing in her marriage after the birth of her first child. Another talked about her husband's ongoing work commitments and the drain this places on her family. I didn't have any wisdom of my own to offer, but did share that I think this book would be great for either of them to read.I've been married 13 years. This book made me thankful for the marriage I have. It also made me determined to pour myself into my marriage. Not to change my husband, but to be changed. If you're recently married, engaged or have been married for years, I'd encourage you to read this book. For the cost of a few hours spent reading, you can see marriage in a new way."

        "user_review": "This book is absolutely amazing. The tag on the cover sums it up: \"What if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy?\" This is a ground-breaking concept in today's world of serial divorces. We seem to shop for spouses like we shop for new clothes. When the marriage gets difficult, or just worn out, we get a new wife or husband.But what if marriage is supposed to be hard? What if the \"worse\" in for better or for worse is pretty much a guarantee, and designed by God, to draw us closer to him, and maybe in the process even draw us closer to our spouse? These were questions that really challenged me to take a look at my all of my relationships. Do I run as soon as the going gets tough? If I don't like the people I work with, do I just get a new job? If I don't like my church, do I shop for a new one? And if I'm not particularly happy with my wife, do I consider just throwing in the towel?These are all questions I've been asking myself while reading this book. The author really helped me come up with some great answers. After 20 years of marriage, through some hard times when I wanted to just run, I am growing to love my wife more than the day I married her. I feel so sad for couples that never get to this point because they gave up, just when the good stuff (the hard stuff) started to happen. And, more importantly, I'm growing closer to God. I can see him working in my life every day. Teaching me how to love, even when those around me aren't very lovable (isn't that what He does every day?)I'd recommend this book for anyone who is married, whether \"happily\" or not so much. It can really help define for you the God-designed-purpose for your marriage: to draw you closer to Him."

        "user_review": "I got rid of my copy before finishing it (roughly four years ago). Between my incomplete reading and poor memory, I am probably doing the book a disservice. But here are some of my criticisms:1. I don't think the main purpose of marriage is to make us holy rather than happy. Marriage was portrayed as a crucible designed to reveal our selfishness and sinfulness. If God instituted marriage before the Fall, I don't see how the hypothesis can hold up. Yes, God can, and does, use everything in our lives to make us holier, including marriage. But I think the overall purpose of marriage is to make us happy. If God designed marriage, then I see it as one good option in living an abundant life on earth. If I shared Thomas' view, I may not have gotten married (my purpose, at least, was to be happy). On the other hand, maybe I would have married anyway, since…2. Being single does not appear to be a good option. I think too great a burden is placed on marriage, depicting it as a unique revealer of God, ourselves, and as a light to the world. I know this is a book about marriage, and there's no need to include benefits of being single. Still, I felt like marriage was being exalted far above being single, which seems to contradict what Jesus and Paul said about being single. Also, I object to ideas like a strong marriage will picture to the world the reconciling love of Christ for His church. Not only because I'm skeptical of such a message being received, but also because I don't think that it exists within the marriage. (Neither spouse plays the role of Redeemer; big jump from a relationship between two humans of equal footing to Christ and the church.) The emphasis on marriage as a witnessing tool also contributes to another issue…3. Divorce is never an option. Thomas says, \"The first reason I keep my marriage together is because it is my Christian duty. If my life is based on proclaiming God's message to the world, I don't want to do anything to challenge that message. And how can I proclaim reconciliation when I seek dissolution?\" I didn't notice encouragement to flee abusive marriages, to protect children from harmful spouses, etc. (I would say it is sometimes one's Christian duty to leave a marriage). But apart from that, I found his condemnation of a failed marriage to be too harsh.4. This book could be detrimental if read by someone with a demanding or controlling spouse. In fact, Thomas goes so far as to say, \"The thought that God wants me to serve him by concentrating on making my wife happy was extraordinary. Can it mean, then, that if my wife is unhappy, I'm failing God?\" No, an unhappy spouse does not equal a failure on the part of the other spouse (it does not mean a failure on anyone's part). One is not to blame for the actions, attitudes, or emotions of one's spouse.5. I usually dislike gender-based advice. While I readily acknowledge differences between men and women, I think cultural differences are too often attributed to biology, and too many generalizations are made. If a couple happens to fit Thomas' stereotypes, the book will be more useful for them. I didn't think it fit too well for my husband and me.6. As someone who doesn't believe in a gender hierarchy, I object whenever patriarchal teaching occurs.I'd prefer the book if it didn't take a doctrinal approach, and instead just tried to offer helpful relational advice.I got the quotes from the book's study guide. I really shouldn't write anything without the book itself, or a better memory, but that hasn't stopped me from hazarding opinions anyway."

        "user_review": "\"Sacred Marriage\" continues to be my go-to book on marriage (which by definition for me could be restated as \"Christian marriage\"). This is my third reading, and I still find myself underlining, \"hmm\"-ing out loud, and learning. Thomas treats marriage with a respect far greater toward God than for happiness, and that makes this book unique and profound.The subtitle explains the premise of the book: \"What if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy?\" This question is one that is explored on every page of every chapter. Thomas' concept is simply stated, albeit hard to live: is the end of marriage personal happiness, or sanctification? It's obvious that Thomas believes the end of marriage is indeed personal sanctification, and Scripture would bear out his conclusions.Because of this unusual premise, the chapters in the book are not what you might expect. Each chapter deals with one area of personal holiness that marriage deals with: truth about God, good prayer, building character, serving, and so forth. In other words, you won't find the typical chapters on \"finances,\" \"in-laws,\" \"sex,\" and so forth. That sort of inward focus--how can this or that area of marriage be improved--goes against the very nature of what Thomas writes: God is most glorified not when a marriage is pleasing to those involved, but when those involved are focused on Christ, rather than themselves or even each other.As much as the book is excellent, though, it needs some complementing. Because of the Godward-focus, there are areas that married coupled should investigate, in light of a God-glorifying lens. Sexuality must be examined, probably in greater light than does Thomas. The same is certainly true for gender roles and headship. This is not an end-all resource, but it doesn't seem to attempt that goal. It does purport to be a central guide and correction for marriages that are focused on satisfaction in self and each other, though, and that is much needed.If you believe Scripture to be true, you really have no good excuse for not purchasing this book. It bears repeated readings, and will challenge your ideas about marriage many times over."

Сім'ї розпадаються тоді, коли ми перестаємо творити й задовольняємося самим лише існуванням.»⠀«Якщо мета шлюбу- просто зробити людину щасливою та насолоджуватися пристрастю та почуттям закоханости, то треба було б кожні два-три роки заново одружуватися.»⠀«Шлюб створює атмосферу, у якій наша любов зазнає найбільших випробувань. Проблема в тому, що таку любов можна лише здобути. Кетрін Енн Портер пише: Любови треба вчитися, вчитися і ще раз вчитися - без кінця. Для ненависти не потрібно жодних інструкцій.»⠀«Найважливіше, що мають почути молоді заручені пари, це те, що добрий шлюб неможливо знайти, це те, заради чого треба працювати.»⠀«Ми не завжди спроможні контролювати впадемо ми чи ні, проте можемо контролювати напрямок, у якому падаємо - назустріч нашій половинці чи віддаляючись від неї.»⠀Це не моя книжка.З багатьма тезами автора я не можу погодитися через свої переконання, але ця книжка була мені корисною!⠀Про книжку:⠀«ВАШ ШЛЮБ — ЦЕ БІЛЬШЕ НІЖ СВЯЩЕННИЙ СОЮЗ З ІНШОЮ ЛЮДИНОЮ.Ця книжка зовсім не про те, як побудувати щасливе подружжя. Вона про те, як ваш шлюб може вам допомогти поглибити свої стосунки з Богом. Від практики щоденного прощення, через красу вашої сексуальности, до величної історії, яку ви, чоловік та дружина, створюєте разом — усе у вашому шлюбі має потенціал для того, щоб ви стали... святими! І не просто святою дружиною чи святим чоловіком, а саме святим подружжям!Стати святим — це покликання кожного християнина. То в чому проблема? А в тому, що дуже часто нашим єдиним зразком святости є люди, які ніколи не жили в подружжі. Дуже часто нам пропонують єдину модель духовности — на зразок монашої: довгі молитви, довгі пости, періоди усамітнення та тиші...⠀#примхливачитака"

        "user_review": "Too many dangerous ideas mixed in with the few good ones.Gary Thomas really makes marriage sound miserable. It's an old, worn-out idea that the more miserable you are, the more you suffer, the holier you are and the happier God is with you.Thomas teaches some very bizarre opinions. With nothing to back it up, he states, as fact, that women are attracted to aggressive men and men are primarily attracted to beautiful women. Then he says how awful it is to marry someone based only on those feelings. He actually advocates for ignoring your emotions and not worrying about whether you feel \"in love\" with the person you choose to marry. He praised the women of previous generations who married men that had all the right qualities but for whom they felt no romantic or sexual attraction. No wonder he's miserable.It is entirely possible, and common, to marry someone to whom you are romantically and sexually attracted AND who has all the right qualities. Why do we have to be miserable? We don't. We can grow in holiness while we are in a HAPPY marriage.Also, it's ok to end a marriage you realize was a big mistake. No, it doesn't hurt your mission for Jesus. Let's stop glorifying misery.Important note-- this book would be downright dangerous to a person in an abusive marriage. Thomas states over and over how important it is to stay even if you aren't happy. A few caveats about abuse aren't enough as most people are victims of emotional abuse, which is hard to define. Most abuse victims blame themselves. This book reinforces those domestic violence myths."

It's not really a how-to process, but rather a mindset/perspective change in viewing our marriage as God intended, regardless of how long we've been married. So many powerful quotes that I would've liked to highlight! (I listened to this.)\"When you say to your spouse 'I don't love you anymore' you are in essence saying 'I can't live like a Christian anymore..'\"He also brought out how our culture has overly romanticized marriage/relationships, which gives young people a skewed view of what true love is. Hadn't really thought about that, but I totally agree!I will be coming back to this book, and feel encouraged and challenged to make my marriage better every day. I can only change myself!"

        "user_review": "This book could have been condensed into one chapter. In my opinion, he's a little too heavy-handed with the whole idea of marriage as a spiritual discipline. Although there is some element of truth in what he's saying, he comes across as being himself in a pretty joyless marriage due to having married very young. I will confess that part of my annoyance with the book is his complementarian view of gender roles, which I staunchly disagree with. But not a bad read entirely. He is right in that most people, Christians and non-Christians alike, see marriage as being given for their happiness and not their holiness. He favors holiness, obviously. But does it have to be entirely joyless?"

But, I found the book both comforting and challenging.Gary Thomas writes in a way that's easy to understand and follow with several appropriate anecdotes to illustrate his points. I usually have a hard time reading non-fiction, but this book flowed nicely. It took me a long time to read because there is so much meat in it to process!Furthermore, he uses lots of scripture and few rhetoric. It's less about building a better marriage and more about seeing the character of God IN marriage. However, his principles can help you build a better marriage as he gives a more proper and biblical view of marriage than most of us hold.Favorite Excerpts:\"It is unfortunate and sad when something so profound as living out and analogy of Christ and his church is reduced to experiencing this relationship as something that will help us avoid sexual sin, keep the world populated, and provide a cure for loneliness.\"\"God is always worthy of being obeyed, and God calls me to serve my spouse-so regardless of how she treats me at any particular moment, I am called to respond as a servant.\"\"No human being can love us the way we long to be loved; it is just not possible for another human to reach and alleviate the spiritual ache that God has placed in all of us.\""

        "user_review": "I read the first few chapters of this book when I was newly engaged, as my pastor recommended it to my husband and I to read as part of our pre-marriage counseling. In the throes of my soon-to-be-wed state, I didn't take the words of this book too seriously. I thought to myself, \"Of course I'm going to love and serve my husband. Of course I am going to grow spiritually. Dissension in my marriage??? NEVER!\" However, five years have passed and I revisited this book, reading it through to the end. This book really made me think about my marriage and where I am placing my priorities. It made me see my husband in a different way and made me think of my marriage as a mission from God. This book doesn't promise seven steps to a better marriage, nor does it even promise to make your marriage better. What this book does do is make you evaluate yourself so that YOU become better. I strongly recommend this book to any married person; however, I would say that for the most part, only Chapter 10 would have caught my attention when I was engaged."

        "user_review": "A thought-provoking and challenging book on the way marriage can be used to build character and foster a servant-hearted, humble attitude in each spouse. When the media is saturated with notions of self-fulfillment and romance as the most important elements of a happy marriage, Gary Thomas paints a picture of what he calls a \"sacred marriage\", shaped by sacrificial love and the spiritual disciplines of forgiveness, perseverance, and respect.Some gems from the book:'When disagreements arise, the natural tendency is to flee. Rather than work through the misunderstanding (or sin), we typically take a much more economical path -- we search for another church, another job, another neighborhood, another friend, another spouse. Marriage challenges this \"flight\" tendency. It encases us with a rock-hard, given-to-God promise that insists we work through the problem to arrive at some resolution. Mature adults realize that every relationship involves conflict, confession, and forgiveness.' (p. 162)"

        "user_review": "4.5*** There was a lot to appreciate in this book. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was written by a man, Gary Thomas. That sounded a little crazy, so let me explain. He wrote largely from his point of view as a husband and man seeking God, so while I found it very helpful and even inspiring that men out there work so hard at their marriage and relationship with God, there was just something missing. Overall, this book encourages you to accept marriage as a challenge for maturity, particularly Christian maturity. There is too little of this in the world today and I feel our love for Christ really should be evident in our homes, not just for our spouses but for our children to witness and learn from as well. For me, this is the best book I have read about marriage so far and I already know I will reread portions of it. Highly recommend."

        "user_review": "If I could give this book six stars, I would. If I could give a copy to every married Christan, I'd do that too. Thomas' perspective - that marriage is designed to produce holiness more than happiness in our lives - is refreshing and rings abundantly true. On top of that, he's an interesting writer who advances his teaching with relatable and often funny stories from his own life and ministry. Highly recommended for married people and engaged people within a few weeks of marriage.Important content warning for single people thinking about reading this book:If you're single, I recommend skipping the chapter on sex. It's very good and helpful content, but for singles it could be quite provocative in an unhealthy way as it's fairly explicit."

His discussion of marital sex was even placed within the context of sanctification. The last chapter was undoubtedly my favourite. The struggle between individual calling and marriage was addressed. How does one live out ones individual calling within the context of marriage? Thomas gives a great answer."

The definitions of service and submission were compelling. The look at sex was different and thought-provoking. The voice he wrote in was a little over-confident overall, and bordered on cocky at times. He was almost clinical in it's analysis and solutions which just lended some sterility to the whole book. Almost like his heart wasn't really in it? Hard to explain on that one. 3-stars: good overall."

The tag line of it, \"what if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy?\" is really compelling to me and one that I totally agree with, but I felt like Gary Thomas ventured far from this central point. I often read chapters & thought, \"I just read a lot but what did it even say?\" Really, I feel like each chapter could've been an article instead.The book did provide good conversation within our group I'm just convinced there are better Christian marriage books out there."

        "user_review": "This book is full of interesting insights and things to think about and to be fair, I think I would get a lot more out of it if I re-read it a time or two. I don't read a lot of books on marriage or parenting anymore because you have to admit the formula of \"you're doin' it wrong, let me show you the one true way!\" gets really old not to mention contradictory and confusing. What I love most about this book is that is NOT at all like that. You won't find 7 tips to communicate better, or sex secrets every couple should know, or how to make him understand women, or how to make her understand men. This book isn't about how to do marriage right, it's about what marriage will do to your soul as you struggle to do your best in your relationship with your spouse. It's about the insights you can gain about God and life from sharing your life intimately with another person. There is discussion of selflessness and sacrifice but it's in a larger context than \"do this to make your marriage work.\" The funny thing is, Thomas very successfully makes the point that if you allow the work of marriage to transform you as an individual, your relationship will also be all that much stronger.As far as weak points, I often felt like as a woman Thomas was not really speaking to me, that a lot of his stronger statements were more addressed to the male half of a couple and a man's perspective. There was much of value for me to ponder nonetheless, but at times it got a little frustrating that he didn't seem to realize how gender-specific the insights were. Also, while I appreciate he is coming at relationships from a slightly more traditional perspective than I am, I was a little chafed by some of the \"women are always like this, men are always like that\" assumptions. I am not a soft and delicate flower, but am no less worthy of respect and consideration and no less a woman because of that; also, my husband doesn't play golf, unlike seemingly every other husband in this book. I speak with tongue in cheek there, but just a bit--there really is an awful lot of golf going on!"

        "user_review": "A powerful look at marriage as a means to making you \"holy\", not \"happy\". This isn't a book that advocates staying in an unhealthy relationship, nor an anti-divorce rhetoric. Rather, it is a book that teaches that marriage has a place in an active and healthy spiritual life, and is a spiritual calling, as much as celibacy was to the faithful nuns and monks of the middle ages. Marriage is a joy and a gift, but also a training ground and mirror for our relationship to Christ. Gary Thomas' concise and relatable writing, combined with his use of scriptural truths, sacred writings, and contemporary references get across a simple, but under-heard message; that marriage is a spiritual discipline. This book is both powerful and immensely readable, and while it never advocates staying in a marriage where a spouse has strayed or abused- and in fact, there is an extremely powerful story about a divorced woman and how it shaped her relationship to Christ within- the book counter culturally challenges the idea that marriage is about personal happiness and fleeting satisfaction, and does so in a non-confrontational, at times almost poetic way. Breaking down marriage into several spiritual components, the book ultimately concludes that \"it is not good for man to be alone\", and that our marriages serve a larger purpose than just comfort on earth. This was an excellent read to supplement premarital counseling for my fiancé and I, but it is also would be a wonderful tool for seasoned couples going through a rough patch."

        "user_review": "My women's group used this book to guide discussions on a weekly basis for about six months. The group contained women with kids, without kids, single, divorce, remarried, widowed, and with traditional marriages. Everyone got something out of the discussions that took place despite their current situation. The author uses a lot of examples to try to get points across. Some are better than others, but all were helpful in getting the discussion going. The one chapter we lingered on the longest was the chapter on sex in marriage. This book speaks plainly about a lot of issues that people deal with in marital relationships. The only weakness I can see is that in a marriage where the wife is a Christian and the husband is abusive or hostile towards Chrisitianity, the advice given could be more harmful than helpful - especially the one on serving. As long as the two people in marriage are relatively equal in regards to their care and concern for each other, the advice given should help their marriages tremendously. Overall, this was a fabulous attempt to conquer difficult subjects. No one can write something that will fit all situations, so this author did a great job reaching the majority of his readers."

I'm giving it three stars because the ideas are interesting, but I found the couples used as examples extremely difficult to relate to. I think the audience for this book was (intentionally or unintentionally) really white, suburban, middle-class conservative people (I kept wondering if any of the women in the book had ever worked a day in their lives or would ever get a job, for example). One can only expect the author to write from their own experience, so I couldn't expect Thomas to include couples that may be outside of his personal network. That said, someone should update this type of book to make it more relatable for married Millennials, and include nonwhite, more economically diverse ones (and I don't just mean poor; rich people have a bucket of different problems, too)."

        "user_review": "WOW! Every couple should read this book and every couple getting ready to get married should read this book. Gary Thomas did a powerful job of showing how marriage is not about our indiviual happiness but about how we can grow in holiness. The copy that I just read was a library book, but if it had been mine it would have been dog-eared and full of stars and underlines! My perspective of marriage has been greatly altered and I look forward to the years ahead that God gives us with a renewed passion."

        "user_review": "It is an empty victory when we imagine that we have somehow guarded ourselves against the influences of a corrupt culture by throwing a string of letters before every video game, television show and movie, warning us of the dangers that lay beyond. The trouble is that there are perfectly clean movies that are free of obscene language, nudity and violence yet still portray a system of values out of sync with a Christian worldview. Though far more subtle, it is these dangers that can destroy the homes of believers, shredding their marriages.Gary Thomas does not present marriage in the same way that marriage is seen in the eyes of contemporary culture. In fact, he goes out of his way to challenge the norm. Marriage in Thomas's view is not a means toward happiness as might be suspected but is a God-ordained institution whereby two people are drawn to a closer mutual relationship with the Creator (12). We might not be able to put in the corner of the television screen a letter that stands for \"unbiblical portrayal of the purpose and ultimate fulfillment of marriage\" but we can guard ourselves from the error of using marriage as a means of self-gratification by renewal of the biblical standard of marriage–its calling, purpose and meaning.Thomas' purpose is simply to ask the question in the subtitle: \"What if God designed marriage to make us holy more than to make us happy?\" To even ask the question is to serious challenge contemporary conceptions of marriage. Early in the book, Thomas chronicles the ruse of romanticism, which places an ill-defined concept of love at the forefront, thus causing some of those whom he mentions to do that which is not in the best interest of the beloved. For D. H. Lawrence, this was trying to break up his interest's marriage (14). Thomas notes that such is a departure of what the true nature of marriage ought to be.The greatest contribution of this work is that reversal. The idea that marriage is to benefit the relationship of spouses with God is antithetical to the view that marriage is to be the culmination of romance and a partnership resulting in unending happiness. It is that thesis that guides the rest of the book, for each chapter somehow relates to investigating how those roles are lived out and how that purposed is enacted in marriage.Another central idea is the recognition of the fallen nature of one's spouse (67-69). As part of a fallen creation, any spouse will fail in one way or another in any marriage. Romance will wane. Affection will ebb. Feelings will be hurt. Expectations will be disappointed. If Thomas' characterization of the fallen, sinful nature of every spouse is correct (and a biblically-centered theology will confirm that it is), then for one to try to gain happiness through another individual will be a futile endeavor. If marriage is intended to be a means of finding happiness n another individual, there will eventually be a failure to achieve that happiness and the result will be an attempt to find that happiness in yet another relationship.The sixth chapter also provides and essential insight into the way that marriage facilitates the holiness of Christ's disciples. Faults and sins will be exposed within marriage like within no other relationship. If marriage were simply an attempt toward happiness, then constantly discovering one's mate's shortcomings will be a source of despair. One will continue to grow in the realization that one's spouse is unable to bring about the happiness that they desire. The difference with a marriage centered on holiness, however, is not insignificant. Learning about a spouse's sins would not be a point of anxiety but rather impetus to mutually admonish each other to conquer by the Spirit the remnants of the fleshly nature that continues to mar the image in which God made us.Another essential point is Thomas' insistence on perseverance. There are few lifelong commitments made in most lives. Cars, jobs and even houses are eventually given up, traded or replaced. Marriage, however, is meant to be one commitment in life that is never to be abandoned. As marriage is to make us holy, perseverance in marriage contributes to that holiness by giving a deeper understanding of God's commitment to us. In the example of Abraham and all of his descendents, we see the commitment of God not just through a lifetime but also through a history of generations of lifetimes (105-107). Continuing through a marriage, maintaining a commitment through times when it might be easier to walk away gives insight into the mind of God who remained with His people through the times when His people turned their backs against him.Thomas' book regularly turns to Scripture in support of its case but Scripture does not appear to be the direct foundation of it. Sacred Marriage is not an exegetically based biblical theology of marriage. This is not to say that the work is inconsistent with Scripture's teaching on marriage. Rather, Scripture seems to be tacked on to what Thomas is saying. The book is generally formed from a broad series of anecdotes about marital failures and successes.Overall, the book tends to be fairly forgettable aside from its primary thesis. Perhaps (and may I be subjective for a moment) because I am currently single I do not think of this book as a reference to which I will continually turn if at some time I eventually get married. If at some point in the future I try to develop a fully fleshed theology of marriage I do not think I will be utilizing this work in developing such a theology. I admit subjectivity here and perhaps marriage for me would change my view of the book.There may be much that we can learn from the example of others and their marriages. In them we can see the exhortation of Scripture applied as we encounter the effects of both acting according to and against Scripture. In Sacred Marriage we come across some of these stories and see some principles of Scriptures applied. At the least, it can never hurt to have some of these ideas put into remembrance. Constant repetition in important matters is always necessary.As Thomas himself pointed out, he is not trying to say anything new (267-268). What he has attempted is to recall the wisdom of the church in its history to enlighten our present understanding of marriage. Thomas has done well in calling again to the mind that which we should already have known.If this book has a role in the ministry of marriage and family, it would be the strength of the central thesis and more importantly seeing how all things are tied to that central focus. A newly wed couple can read the stories and see examples for them to follow or perhaps see warnings of what to avoid. Couples that have been married can use the book to prod them toward renewed commitment, identifying some of the faults that they have between themselves that they have ignored or just lived with. It can be easy to let sins fester in the recesses of our lives but seeing the harm that they have caused other can provoke us to deal with those sins before they similar tear at us and destroy our marriage.Certainly there is a lot of fluff on the shelves of Christian marriage guidance. While this work might not be a foundational guide to Christian marriage or a sold treatise on the nature of marriage as God has intended it, I wouldn't count it as part of the cetera that can be ignored. The book can serve couples at any point in their relationship as an entry point to discussion. The scope is broad enough that working through the book together can bring out in discussion just about any point that would need to be dealt with in a marriage. Conversely, the book is focused enough to drive couples to constantly ask the question of how different facets of the marriage relationship can lead to a better understanding of God, a deeper walk with Christ and a more intimate holiness that seeks the way the our Lord has given us.In marriage there can be many pitfalls. There can be numerous places where we are ready to quit. There can be several points where we fail. If marriage in our minds is nothing more than a means toward the end of personal happiness, then when these troubles arise the marriage will be destroyed or we will consign ourselves to lifelong misery. Thomas has reminded us that happiness is not the primary goal. It is holiness that will see us through our failures, that will overcome our temptations and drive us to perseverance in our marriages."

        "user_review": "Author Gary Thomas affirms the value and purpose of marriage in this book. He suggests the purpose of marriage is not primarily our happiness but our holiness, and when holiness is the pursuit, happiness/satisfaction often follows. As an engaged woman, I truly appreciate this perspective. Our culture's view of marriage and relationships in general is a selfish one: Will this person make me happy? Then, when pleasure fails, the relationship often ends. However, when holiness or the intentional desire to become more Christ-like through marriage is the goal, couples find joy in serving each other and in a purpose that transcends themselves. Thomas provides good examples and Scriptural support throughout, and I will definitely want to re-read this book again at some point. Although this book is written toward married couples, it is also an excellent reading for dating or engaged ones."

        "user_review": "I was sitting on the patio of a bar in Key West Florida. It was August, it was hot. The bar was on the beach where there was lots of sand and water. In the water I saw dolphins and waves. The dolphins jumped and the waves waved.My glass was empty. The waiter walked up to my table. \"More absinthe miss?\" He asked. \"No, I better not. *burp*\" I put my hand over my glass \"I read somewhere that it can cause hallucinations and nightmares. Just some ice water please.\" I said. He put an empty glass in front of me, tipped his picture of water over my glass until it was full, at that time he stopped pouring.A man I did not know walked up to my table and said to the waiter \"No one in Key West is to stop drinking alcohol while they are conscious, you know the rules Manuel! Don't make me repeat myself; did you hear me? Don't make me repeat myself, it's annoying.\" Manuel rolled his eyes.\"I'll drink to that.\" I said and held up my glass of ice water to the stranger, then put it to my lips and drank. It was cold. I set it back down on the table. \"I just finished a book where everyone repeated themselves……drove me to drink!\"\"Sorry Mr. Hemingway\" said Manuel \"she said she wanted ice water, so that's what I gave her\". A cat ran by, it was fast. \"Meow\" it said. It was orange. \"But you know the rules Manuel, you know the rules.\" Repeated Mr. Hemingway \"I know the rules Mr. Hemingway, how could I not? You tend to repeat yourself constantly, it must be all the absinthe…..\" muttered Manuel.\"What did you say Manuel?\" Asked Mr. Hemingway \"Nothing\" said Manuel. \"Bring the lady some Champagne right away!\" said Mr. Hemingway. Manuel walked away towards the kitchen.\"Who are you?\" I asked the man I did not know. \"Hemingway, you wouldn't happen to be related to the writer would you? His book The Sun Also Rises was the book I was just referring to; I don't remember ever being quite so bored. On the bright side, I think it did wonders for my blood pressure.\" I said.Dressed in worn khaki shorts and a Hawaiian shirt with one too many colors, he stood there at my table and squinted at me, sweat rolling down the sides of his red face and into his gray beard. It was hot. He set his drink down on the table, hard, and pulled out a chair and sat down. \"May I sit?\" he asked as he put his dirty bare feet up on the table and tipped the chair back. \"Sure, you're already in the chair. Besides I don't think it will be long before you fall on your ass.\" I said, I drank some water, it was cold. \"Language! I'm Ernest Hemingway the guy who wrote that boring book\" he put his feet on the ground and the chair dropped down with a bang. He put his right hand out to shake mine. I stared at it for a while then took it.\"Stephanie. Hey, I don't want to come across as insensitive but aren't you dead?\" I asked \"Really? I don't feel dead….at least I don't think I am.\" Said the not dead Ernest \"Damn! Absinthe lives up to it's reputation.\" I said and smacked the left side of my head with my left hand. My head was hard.\"Manuel!! Where's that champagne?\" I shouted in a panic. \"So\" Ernest picked up his drink and drank the whole thing in one gulp. \"I am one of the greatest American writers, if not the greatest, everybody says so. And you…..\" he paused and pointed his finger at me using the same hand that still held the glass, the melting ice clinked \"you didn't like the Sun Also Rises?\" he asked and set his glass down.\"I know, I heard the same thing, that you were one of the greatest American writers, so imagine my surprise when I didn't love it like the rest of the human race. In fact, I really didn't like it AT ALL! Please don't hurt me.\"Manuel walked back to the table caring the bottle of Champagne and two glasses. He sat the glasses in front of us and went about the task of opening the bottle. \"Thank god your back Manuel, I think I'm hallucinating. I hope champagne helps things normalize.\" I said, the bottle said \"pop.\" \"It won't help because you are not hallucinating.\" He said and poured the Champagne, he turned and walked off. I picked up the glass and drank. It was bubbly and cold.\"What else didn't you like about my book?\" Asked Ernest \"I'm really not comfortable telling you to your face, but, alright\" I said \"I found all the characters to be aimless, unlikable, drunkards that didn't have any idea what to with their lives but travel about the world constantly drunk….which doesn't sound all that bad on the surface, but it was not interesting.\" I said \"They were excruciatingly boring that I couldn't care enough about them to remember who was who.\" I said \"It felt like it would never end, but when it did end the only thing that I liked about it was the fact that it was finally over. No big payoff to make the boring book worth my time.\" I sighed and finished off my Champagne, I poured myself and Ernest another glass.\"Wow. Sorry you hated it. I suppose you can't please everyone.\" He said. \"I'll buy you dinner to repay you for putting you through that.\"\"That's not necessary, but I could eat. I must bathe first.\" I said. \"Well sure, it is hot after all.\" He said \"Yes, I must bathe you understand? One cannot dine without bathing first, as you know, so you will have to wait until I bathe.\"\"I must bathe. I must bathe. I. must. Bathe.\" I said.\"Now you're just making fun of me.\" he said.\"Yup……I will make you suffer the way you made me suffer.\" I smiled.\"Great. I'm looking forward to it.\" Said not dead Ernest. We swayed to our feet, Ernest took my arm, we steadied ourselves and stumbled off into the sunset.Also reviewed onshelfinflicted"

Women make swell friends.5.\tIf you suffer from domestic abuse, the best way to work it out is by going through as many men as possible in the shortest time, and then discard them like wet tissues once you're done --- if you happen to be pretty enough to attract scores of them, that is.6.\tThe best way to work out existential angst is to drink your way through France and Spain.7.\tThe Left Bank sucks.

Too tight to count.Hic.Hemingway might have perfectly captured the Lost Generation's times, but he also succeeded in inducing a profound ennui in me, especially during the long stretches in which the characters (none who is terribly interesting to begin with) do nothing except drink (\"I'm a little tight you know. Amazing, isn't it? Did you see my nose?\") and flirt with each other. These passages are tediously repetitive, and the effect is like being trapped in a Left Bank café with a bunch of casual acquaintances who insist on regaling you with boring anecdotes from their boozy Spain road trip. After a while, your eyes start to glaze and your attention wanders: you begin to take in the Belle Epogue interior, the cute waiter, the way the afternoon sun casts interesting patterns on the white tablecloth --- anything that is more interesting than the dull main narrative. I just didn't care for any of them, and that Brett woman is a biatch. Why is everyone so desperately in love with her? They told me that her former husband slept with a gun under his pillow, butwhois she really? And I wish that everyone would stop whining and being glib for a while so that they can tell me more about that wonderful Basque country. But no, they always return to these tedious, unaffecting love triangles.You guys are the Lost Generation indeed."

Or maybe I'm an idiot. It's possible. This book is supposedly one of his masterpieces - if not his magnum opus. I thought it was - gulp - kinda boring.Generally, I attempt to avoid using the word \"boring\" in a review. It's a broad, vague, and diluted descriptor; a subjective one-off that doesn't tell you anything. Its use is better suited for a bitter 10th grader's five-paragraph theme, turned in on the last day of school after that tenth grader skimmed twenty pages, read the Cliffs Notes version, and stayed up all night typing with two fingers. I try to hold my Goodreads reviews to a slightly higher standard (the standard of an 11th grader who is taking summer school classes to get a jump on senior year).Really, though, that was my impression: boring. Of course, I didn't read this while lapping sangria in Madrid, which I've heard will heighten this novel's overall effect.The Sun Also Risestells the story of Jake Barnes, an ex-patriate living in Paris. He was wounded in World War I and is now impotent. He is in love with Ashley, who is a... What did they call sluts in the early 20th Century? Because that's sort of what she is, though she has a tender place in her heart for Jake, to whom she keeps returning. Jake is a journalist, apparently haunted by the war, and he spends his time drinking in Paris. There's also a guy named Robert Cohn, a former boxer, who's also in love with Ashley. Bill and Mike also hang around; Mike was originally in a relationship with Ashley, before he lost her to Cohn, who in turn loses her to a Spanish bullfighter.The plot, as it is, involves a bunch of drinking in Paris. Jake drinks a lot, stumbles home, then drinks some more before falling asleep. (The drinking and stumbling home reminds me of my own life, which is worth at least one star). Jake eventually takes the train to Spain to do some fishing. Hemingway describes the scene in excruciating detail and you really get a feel for the place:Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain towards the north.The book goes on in this manner, for some time. It's as though Hemingway has turned into an eloquent Garmin device. Step by step. The walk to the creek. The heat of the sun. The taste of the wine. It is all very vivid, and beautifully written, but really, it didn't go anywhere. It seemed like filler. Something to break up the constant drinking (while the drinking breaks up the Spanish travelogue).The lack of a plot normally wouldn't bother me much, but the book as a whole just wasn't working for me. I didn't care for the characters, who are mostly drunken, indolent, well-off whiners. Also, I was intensely jealous of the characters, who are mostly drunken, indolent, well-off whiners. In other words, aspirational figures.Really, though, I just wanted more out of this book. Hemingway's other works have burrowed deep into my consciousness, so that I find myself referring back to them time and again.The Sun Also Risesdid not achieve this feat.Eventually, Jake's merry band of drunkards go to Pamplona to watch the bullfights. There is drinking. Fighting. Drinking. Bullfighting. Drinking. Drinking. Passing out. Drinking. I actually got a contact drunk from reading this book.I imagine that sex also occurred, somewhere in the midst of the drinking and the bulls and the overflowing testosterone, but Hemingway is discrete.There are some good things, here. As I mentioned earlier, Hemingway is a master of description. His prose is deceptively simple; his declarations actually do a great deal to put you there, into the scene, with immediacy. The book also features one of Hemingway's most famous quotes: \"Nobody lives life all the way up, except bullfighters.\" For some reason, that line has taken on a kind of profundity, though I have to admit, I almost missed it in context.The best part of the book is the last lines, uttered by Jake Barnes: \"Isn't it pretty to think so.\" I'll leave it to you to determine its meaning. As for me, I am anxiously awaiting the moment when, after a night of hard drinking, I can use this line on someone who has just uttered an inane comment.Alas, I'm still waiting for that moment. And that gives me all the excuse I need to keep sidling up to the bar, ordering a whiskey straight with a whiskey back, and chatting up the people around me in the hopes that one of the drunks I meet will also be a Hemingway fan."

        "user_review": "If I were Hemingway's English teacher (or anyone's any kind of teacher) I'd say, \"This reads more like a screenplay than a novel. Where are your descriptions, where is the emotion??\"And he would say something like, \"The lack of complex descriptions helps focus on the complexities and emptiness of the characters' lives, and the emotion is there, it's only just beneath the surface, struggling to be free!\"And I'd say, \"OK, I'll move ya from a C to C+.\"BasicallyThe Sun Also Risesshows that Hemingway liked bullfights a lot more than most of the people reading his books, and that he was vain but also hated himself. While the characters are wittily funny from time to time, the whole thing doesn't hold a candle to, I don't know,Seinfeld. Without being told, \"Ah yes, this is about the true character of America!\" you'd think it was just a drab romance novel with more subtleties than most.Speaking of, how was this about America? It was more about America's elite. Most Americans in 1926 weren't hanging out in France and Spain, moaning about their lives. They were hanging out in America, trying to make it. You know, without dying.Pretentious, with poor descriptions and transparent characters (I can give a character a subtle injury too and have it pain him, does that make me amazing?), The Sun Also Rises is one of the most overrated books I've ever read. I'd rather read a 1926 newspaper."

        "user_review": "This may be my favorite book of all time. At any rate, it's definitely on the top ten list and by far my favorite Hemingway (and I do love some Hemingway). The first time I read this, I loved Lady Brett Ashley. Is she a bitch? Sure, but I don't think she ever intentionally sets out to hurt anyone. And it might be argued that she has reason to be one: her first true love dies in the war from dysentery (not exactly the most noble of deaths) and she's physically threatened by Lord Ashley, forced to sleep on the floor beside him and his loaded gun (and let's clarify that,no, that's not a euphemism, just in case you're a perv). Then we have the one man who might make her happy, Jake Barnes. Poor, poor Jake, who doesn't have a gun, let alone a loaded one (yup, that's a euphemism--snicker away). I think Brett is one of the most tragic figures in American literature. Disillusioned by the war and how it irrevocably changed her life, she tries to fill the void with alcohol and sex--and destroys herself in the process.However, upon rereading the novel, I realized how eclipsed Jake had been by Brett during my first reading. I also realized how I had misinterpreted him during my first reading. I thought Jake was as lost as the rest of the \"Lost Generation,\" but I now believe that he is the only one who is not lost (with the exception of Bill Gorton, whose line \"The road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs\" may be my favorite in the book). If there's anyone with reason to give up on life, it's Jake. Does he pine for Brett? Yes. Does he come to hate Cohn for his affair with Brett? Affirmative. Does he get over Brett and realize that, even if properly equipped for a sexual relationship, a relationship with her would end as tragically as all of her other conquests? Abso-damn-lutely. After all, Brett is Circe, according to Cohn, and anyone lured into her bed will lose their manhood. The success of the relationship between Brett and Jake hinges on the fact that Jake literally has nothing to lose in this respect.Cross posted atThis Insignificant Cinder"

        "user_review": "\"Funny,\" Brett said. \"How one doesn't mind the blood.\" (p. 211)Fifth or sixth reading. IMO, this is one of the essential books of life. It never fails. It possesses—for the right reader—an enormity of narrative pleasure and it grips from the very first line. Its storytelling is so exhilarating that one gets goosebumps.Jake Barnes, our narrator, fought in The Great War for Italy (1914-18) when he was injured. Recuperating in the hospital he meets and falls in love with Lady Brett, a nurse. Later on, in Paris, where he works as a journalist, he runs into Brett again. Their relationship is now pure torture. Their chemistry is thermonuclear — she says Jake's touch turns her to jelly and his love for her is beyond question — but sexual intimacy is impossible. Jake's particular agony now, which he suffers in silence, is to standby while Brett sleeps with other men.The passage at the Paris nightclub with the gay boys doesn't bother me as it used to. Jake knows he's being unreasonable. The queers, with whom Brett arrives at the club, have working penises and choose not to use them on her. To a man made impotent by war, a young man in love with her, their preference must seem like a kind of madness. Moreover, there may be a fear on his part that he's becoming like them. That is, indifferent to female sexuality. He's not, of course, not emotionally.Now we've left Paris, taking the train to Bayonne. Then in an open car up the dusty roads to the plateau and Pamplona. From here Jake and Bill go to Burguete to do some fly fishing while Robert Cohn returns to San Sebastián to await Brett and fiancé, Mike. The trip on the bus to Burguete—through the stark countryside while Jake and Bill drink wine with the Basques—dazzles, lifts one's spirits. The fishing sequences on the Irati River are beautifully spartan. Then after five days the fishermen are back in Pamplona. Mike and Brett and Cohn are about to complete the five-some.So now we've got three men together in Pamplona who love Brett, two of whom have slept with her: Jake, Mike and Robert Cohn. Jake sadly can have nothing more to do with her, though they remain close. Cohn is like a child, always staring at her, and the bankrupt fiance, Mike, doesn't like it. They all go to watch the bulls arrive at the ring. Steers are brought in to \"calm\" the bulls. This usually ends with a steer or two being gored. That's when Mike refers to Cohn as a steer for the mute worshiping manner in which he follows Brett around.\"I would've thought you'd love being a steer, Robert.\"\"What do you mean, Mike?\"\"They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they're always hanging about so.\"We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking.\"I should think you'd love it. You'd never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don't just sit there.\"\"I said something, Mike. Don't you remember? About the steers.\"\"Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can't you see we're all having a good time here?\"\"Come off it, Michael. You're drunk,\" Brett said.\"I'm not drunk. I'm quite serious.IsRobert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?\"\"Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.\"\"Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren't the bulls lovely? . . . Why don't you say something, Robert? Don't just sit there like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She's slept with lots of better people than you.\"\"Shut up,\" Cohn said. He stood up. \"Shut up, Mike.\"\"Oh, don't stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won't make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don't you know you're not wanted?\" (p. 141-142)It occurs to the reader just how painful this exchange must be for Jake, even though he doesn't mention it. Hemingway was a master of omission, of not talking about the elephant in the room. I've read and reread this passage and every time it surprises me anew. In some ways Jake is like a steer, too, but he doesn't moon and fawn. Instead he's very stoic, tortured, yes, but good at not seeming so, good at joining in the party.Then the fiesta \"explodes\" with two rockets over the main square and the peasants, who until then have been drinking quietly in the outer town, come rushing into the main square. They're singingriau riaumusic and dancing. \"The square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.\" (p. 159) The peasants dance about Brett as if she were some kind of Madonna. Everyone is ushered into a wine shop; some peasant women are wearing necklaces of garlic and one is hung about Brett's neck. These are among the most moving moments in the book for the author captures the wonderful local manners with their astonishing air of friendliness and formality. The description is spare yet rich in detail.The end is a knockout. Jake is held in odium because he has allowed the bullfight to be compromised. Whereas before, Jake and the hotel owner, Montoya, saw each other as fellow aficionados, now Jake is seen not just as a disappointment, but as a corrupter of the bullfight. There is much I'm not touching on here. Please read it."

        "user_review": "I've read this book every year since 1991, and it is never the same book. Like so many things in this world,The Sun Also Risesimproves with age and attention.Some readings I find myself in love with Lady Brett Ashley. Then I am firmly in Jake Barnes' camp, feeling his pain and wondering how he stays sane with all that happens around him. Another time I can't help but feel that Robert Cohn is getting a shitty deal and find his behavior not only understandable but restrained. Or I am with Mike and Bill and Romero on the periphery where the hurricane made by Brett and Jake and Robert destroys spirits or fun or nothing (which is decidedly something).And then I am against them all as though they were my sworn enemies or my family. No matter what I feel while readingThe Sun Also Rises, it is Hemingway's richest novel for me.I feel it was written for me. And sometimes feel it was written by me (I surely wish it was).Hemingway's language, his characterizations, his love for all the people he writes about (no matter how unsavory they may be), his love of women and men, his empathy with the pain people feel in life and love, his touch with locale, his integration of sport as metaphor and setting, his getting everything just right with nothing out of place and nothing superfluous, all of this makes The Sun Also Rises his most important novel.It is the Hemingway short story writ large. It is the book he should be remembered for but isn't. I often wonder why that is, and the conclusion I come to is this:The Sun Also Risesis too real, too true, too painful for the average reader to stomach. And many who can are predisposed to hateHemingway.A terrible shame that so many miss something so achingly beautiful."

        "user_review": "My feelings haven't changed since my last re-read of The Sun Also Rises (my earlier review is below). I'm still amazed at how fully the characters come alive on the page! I don't think The Sun Also Rises is for everyone; however, nearly from beginning to end, I'm engaged in the story.Just finished a re-read of The Sun Also Rises (my favorite Hemingway book-last read in 2014). I didn't provide a review at the time so I thought I would (try to) explain why this book speaks to me. First, it is deceptively easy to fall into with its short sentences and simple language. Nothing is forced. However, it is the mood Hemingway creates in this novel which really engages me. Perhaps that says as much about me as it does about the novel. The appeal is not so much about the story; it is how the characters move through the scenes with a sense that nothing can touch them (while conversely, they can't really touch or be important to anyone else).This exemplifies that lack of hope in the so-called 'lost generation,' that feeling that nothing you do will make a difference. The Sun Also Rises is not a feel-good book, but it allows you to re-evaluate people as social animals who constantly struggle and fail (and maybe once in a while succeed) in forging meaningful relationships. In some ways, the carefree expat life of the characters seems idyllic; however, Hemingway also makes you feel that slipping into this existence (even with its charms) might make you want to spit at the world. The Sun Also Rises captures a historical moment, perhaps not just of the lost generation, but also of future generations uncertain of their place in the world."

        "user_review": "To put it bluntly,The Sun Also Rises(akaFiesta) is probably the most overrated little novel in the history of 20th-century American literature. It reads like an alcoholic's travelogue set in France and Spain, jazzed up with some shallowménage à troisplotline. But — it is not as bad as it sounds. Let me explain.About the first half of the book is set in mid-1920s Paris. Jake Barnes, the narrator, goes from one bar to the next restaurant to the next café, eats and drinks heavily with a group of Anglo-American bohemians, provides all sorts of insignificant details about what they've gulped down and how much was on the bill, and then catches yet another taxi and goes on boozing away into the night. All the while doing some silly Parisian place-name dropping, to the extent that it sometimes feels as though you are reading a Paris tour pamphlet. And you could almost — as I'm sure some readers have — trace back all the places Jake & Co have been to in this book.The second half of the novel, thankfully, goes somewhat uphill. The merry bunch of drunkards travel south to the Basque region, first to a short fishing trip in the Pyrenees — it all ends up with a few bottles of wine and a nap on the turf... and, later, at theFiesta de San Fermínin Pamplona. Just as he does for Paris, Hemingway describes the places and local habits in the manner of a tour guide. I suspect he significantly contributed to the international renown of the Pamplona festival too. To this day, people from all over the world come running (literally) to feel the adrenaline burst, when some half-a-ton black bull charges down a narrow street into the hysterical crowd.The high point of the novel is, doubtless, the description of the bullfight toward the end. Of course, it is not very different from what a sports commentator would do regarding a football match. But in this occasion, Hemingway's terse, crisp, lean, hard-boiled, journalistic style does wonders to convey the atmosphere on theplaza de toros, the brutality and sometimes the beauty of thematador's performance. So much so that, when he describes Pedro Romero's movements when fighting the bull, it is as though Hemingways is talking about an art form — perhaps implicitly, his own craft as a writer: \"Romero's bullfighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time.\" In this case, I have to take my hat off and declare that bothJ.K. RowlingandDavid Foster Wallacecan eat their heart out with their games of Quidditch and Eschaton!The little plot regarding the group of men orbiting one beautiful woman (Brett Ashley), who ultimately is eager to sleep with all of them, is possibly autobiographical, but quite frankly vapid —Fitzgeralddoes a much better job at describing similar interactions. The only aspect that is quite remarkable is that these characters are all WWI veterans and, in a way, still suffer from the wounds and traumas of war. Hence, we suppose, their decadent, numbing and self-destructive behaviour with booze, sex, fistfighting and intoxicating forms of entertainment. In a way, underneath all their tough machismo, Hemingway's characters are quite vulnerable, wretched, and even a bit pathetic.Since Hemingway's time, theaficiónfor Spanish traditions and bullfighting in particular — which he shared with Bizet, Ravel, Picasso, Eisenstein, John Huston and many others — has dwindled considerably. To the point where most people now take a dim view of thecorridas de toros, and on the whole, have turned to football or other sports instead. Still, the influence of Hemingway's style has become so prevalent in our time that it has become something of a cliché. For instance, in the SF genre alone, the laddish attitude in Heinlein'sStranger in a Strange Land; the detailed and stripped-down descriptions in Cormac McCarthy'sThe Road; the constant wine drinking in G.R.R. Martin'sA Game of Thrones... all these are tropes stolen from Hemingway."

        "user_review": "That summer of 1969, the experience of reading this book on my friend Doug's recommendation was a peaceful hiatus from collegiate life.Doug worked at a nearby swimming pool as a lifeguard, and I was immersed in reading up extensively for my Eng Lit degree.Larry, across the street from Doug, would share his Yamaha motorbike seat with me in the evenings for long rides, while Doug zipped around closer to home on his Honda 50 scooter.It was a sun-filled summer, perfect for a Hemingway novel in the same vein.I loved it and could relate.Its hero, Jake, was a lot like me. Uncompromisingly straight in orientation, we both fell victim to a private Daemon.And Jake drinks.Drinks to forget the war injury that has driven a wedge between him and his ladylove Brett. So they usually end up the evenings getting a little happy.Oh, so you say the sun also rises? Dang, missed it again.The real problem with Jake - and his great creator Hemingway - is that it's impossible for him to forget.But you gotta deal with it!And balancing homophobia with the blurred lines of vision afforded by drink always backfires.If you blur those lines they're gonna bite you back. Happened to me, too, the year after I read this. Always keep one eye open.Hemingway didn't even believe in precautions.When he died in the JFK Era there was new hope in the air.But Hemingway didn't feel it.All he felt were his demons.Folks, never make a habit of drowning your demons. For your self pity will then give them strength.DEAL with them now -BEFORE they roar back, seeking revenge."

        "user_review": "The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway's brilliant 1926 novel about the Lost Generation is a must read for Twentieth Century literature.I was assigned this as a junior in college, our English professor told us to read it and to be prepared to talk next week. The next class was spent on students describing their thoughts about the novel and what we thought it meant. With a smug smile and somewhat of a condescending air, the instructor stepped form his podium and said something to the effect that readers had been missing the point for decades.This was my first experience with an unreliable narrator. Literature would never be the same again.Complex and told on many levels, this also contains some of the most archetypal characters in all of modern literature, highlighted by the inimitable Lady Brett. Dangerous and contrary to Hemingway's ideals of masculine superiority, Lady Brett Ashley would be recreated somewhat in his later story \"The Short Happy Life of Frances Macomber.\"2023 reread -Imagine being invited to a rich person's home. The residence is immaculate, the serving staff are gracious and hospitable, the hosts are kind and formally accepting. Everyone is very nice and the setting is genteel and pleasant. And then you realize that there are no chairs, none at all; unless you choose to sit on the floor, there is no where to sit. There are also no refreshments. When asked, the host replies that unfortunately there are no public restrooms. Everyone is standing and you then realize everyone is waiting for you to leave. With smiles and courteous platitudes you are escorted out and you hear the lock click behind you as you depart.Hemingway serves us up a subtle invitation to a fiesta, but it is for a club of which we do not belong. We are invited guests, but we are not truly welcome, and though our host is polite and observes all of the requisite etiquette, we never feel comfortable here and that is by design. Our guide describes for us a tension, an unsettling and inhospitable crisis between friends and lovers and we are voyeurs, being a spectator to a bloody bullfight that we are ill equipped to witness.A masterpiece certainly, a book in the high atmosphere of literary greatness and yet one that can easily deceive the reader and leave its audience with an uncertainty, like receiving a firm handshake and a winning smile, only in passing realizing that the one smiling and warmly shaking your hand had been crying and was only just holding it all together.This was my first experience with an unreliable narrator. In most books, the narrator is on our side, they are a guide for us to the action of the story. Frequently they are also the protagonist and the tale is of and / or about them. Hemingway was too good to leave it at that and our narrator mostly tells the truth, sometimes with fastidious accuracy. But an observant reader will see the signs and will question which statements are correct and which have been tainted with bias and jealousy. More than that, we are allowed to see not just the fine tapestries and expensive settings, but also a glimpse into the back rooms where hypocrisy, cruelty and inhumanity dwell and lurk.This is filled with colorful, memorable characters. The most obvious standouts are Jake and Lady Brett, but Robert Cohn, Bill Gorton, Mike Campbell, Frances Clyne and Romero and Belmonte are also mesmerizing and from these oblique vantages we see Hemingway's genius demonstrated.First published in 1926, when Ernest was 27, this is the story of the Lost Generation and its convoluted presentation has been fascinating and confusing readers for almost a hundred years and will likely continue for time unknown ahead. This is a fairly timeless story about love and loss and war and heartbreak and class distinctions and being involved in something that you can nonetheless never truly be a part.This is after all Hemingway and there are also excellent outdoor scenes and fine descriptions of fishing and bullfights. While this aspect of the book will likely get little attention, this demonstrates Hemingway's unique ability to convey the spirit of action and here we see some of his best sports writing.Sex. Hemingway describes Brett as a modern woman, unfettered by conventional moralities, but the author goes further and shows how sex, not just romantic love, can also be a cruelly divisive element in this society.We can understand the human costs of this drama, but we will never be a part of this generation and so can never truly, fully understand. We are invited to see and experience but not to stay."

        "user_review": "There's a very nice restaurant that my wife and I frequent that has become our go-to spot for special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries. When we first started going here, I saw that they were serving absinthe. I'd been curious about the drink since first reading Hemingway's descriptions of it inThe Sun Also Risesback in high school.Banned for most of the twentieth century in the U.S. for wildly exaggerated claims of it's hallucinogenic qualities, it was made available to be imported here again in 2007. When I saw it on the menu, my mind immediately conjured images of Hemingway and his fellow expatriates sipping it in Paris with ironic detachment. (The restaurant even features a Hemingway inspired version mixed with champagne that's called Death in the Afternoon.) I wanted to try some, but it's $12 a glass, which seemed a bit pricey for the sake of literary cocktail experimentation. And I gotta admit that I was slightly nervous about having some kind of absinthe-based freak-out.However, I've been on a Jazz Age book kick lately, and a few weeks back when we were having dinner at this place, I finally said to hell with it and ordered a glass. The waiter asked if I'd tried it before and must have had some bad experiences with newbies drinking it. I promised him I was indulging for purely experimental purposes and would not hold him responsible.So he brought the absinthe out and did the whole bit with the special spoon and the sugar cube. I would have been lost there except I'd seen Johnny Depp do this routine inFrom Hell.Finally, I tried my first sip.It tasted like a combination of black licorice and what I can only assume is the flavor of rotting corpses. And I hate black licorice so much that I almost would have preferred just the rotting corpse taste.However, when you pay $12 for a drink, you choke that mother down. So I drank it, cursing Hemingway the entire time and wishing I could dig his body up and reanimate him so I could give him another shotgun blast to the face for ever putting the idea of drinking that vile stuff into my head in the first place.Oh, and that night, I had some of the most fucked up nightmares I've had in years so maybe the hallucinogenic qualities weren't exaggerated all that much.So when I was re-readingThe Sun Also Risesand Jake gets completely hammered on absinthe, I almost tossed my cookies as the memory of that black licorice flavored corpse came back to me. Repeated exposure to that drink would also explain why Jake would put up with Brett's routine. Your junk doesn't work but you keep hanging out with the woman who claims to love you but demands your help in hooking up with other men? I would have been on a boat to Antarctica to get away from her man-eating ass, but he was deranged from drinking that shit.This book is still pretty damn good, but I'm deducting a star just because it tricked me into trying absinthe. Take that, Hemingway!"

I assumed I wouldn't like it, but I picked it up to be delighted by the following:- beautiful, clean writing- a plot I was invested in- characters who interested me from the first page to the last, from our protagonist to every supporting characterThere were things I have historically hated reading about (bullfighting) that this time I found enjoyable. There were tropes I've always detested (cheating and affairs and what have you) that didn't bother me in the least. There were clichés of the time (melancholy men and the women whose love they feel entitled to) done differently enough to be a pleasure.I'm still in a state of disbelief.Bottom line: This is my first Ernest Hemingway book, but baby, it won't be my last!!!---------------pre-reviewi've owned this book for six years and i've meant to read it for even longer and never once in all that time did i expect to like it this much.review to come / 4.5 stars---------------currently-reading updatesfeeling: scholarly.clear ur sh*t book 40quest 19: a book you forgot you owned---------------tbr reviewi've never read an ernest hemingway book, but i have had two of them on my owned tbr for six years. so that's kind of the same thing"

Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?\"Looking through my copy of The Sun Also Rises, I believe it is the most quotable Hemingway I have read. Line after line resonates with me on the deepest level possible. I used to think the Lost Generation represented a unique time in history, and I was vaguely jealous of their beautiful misery. The older I get, the more I believe this is the universal novel describing the human condition. The hardboiled by day, broken by night attitude to life hurts and attracts. As a person who has been dragging myself along from country to country, I know Hemingway was right when he said you can't escape yourself by moving.But you can build that fashionable surface of the glorious expatriate - which haunts you by night.Wonderful, wonderful prose!"

        "user_review": "I think there is something cheesey about reviewing an old book, but I felt I had to write something, as I constructed my senior thesis in college with this book as the cornerstone, I have read it at least six times, and I consider The Sun Also Rises to be the Great American Novel. Why?1) Hemingway was, if nothing else, a great American. A renaissance man, a soldier, a fisherman, and a sportswriter, a romantic and an argumentatively direct chauvinist, a conflicted religious agnostic who never abandoned religion (and, it could be argued, never wrote about anything but his conflicts with religion), Hemingway was a stereotype red-blooded American like no other great writer. An argument could be made for Fitzgerald, but the crux of that argument lies in his relationship to Hemingway (and his psychotic wife. By the way, I love Fitzgerald. He is just a touch wordy).2) The Sun Also Rises describes (among other things) disillusionment with the \"American Way\" and what that had come to mean (especially emphasized through the walking wounded, contrasted always with previous generations' \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria more\" mentality). Unlike other similarly-themed novels, however, the book does not take place in America. I postulate the Great American Novel must take place somewhere other than America, to reveal the way in which Americans can be defined as such anywhere, and to ephasize said disillusionment. I have other reasons to think thus, but suffice to say for the moment.3) The Sun Also Rises does not end so drastically as other great works of Hemingway's, such as A Farewell to Arms (not afraid to say I shed tears at the end of that one) or For Whom the Bell Tolls. His best ending was in Old Man and the Sea, but that work (at the risk of sounding blasphemous here) was slightly too poppy to be his best.4) The book does not begin with the narrator (the opening describing Robert Cohen). Americans exist in relationship to one another. The country has been built through a competitive spirit- fostered by democracy and that ideal we call \"The American Dream\". The backlash of all that is a natural inclination to \"Keep up with the Jones',\" as it were. Jake Barnes is an observer, separated from the Americans and from the Europeans yet constantly comparing himself, directly or by insinuation, to others.In short, read the damn book. If you don't get it, read it again. It is arguable (perhaps, though I doubt it) that this book may not be the best ever written, but I do believe no greater has ever been penned.You want a great trifecta? Read The Sun Also Rises, then The Great Gatsby, then Eliot's The Wasteland. Follow those up by reading Ecclesiastes 1 and the Revelations of John. Now go to a cocktail party and start a conversation. You're welcome."

Quite the contrary.Dry like a very dry Jerez, a \"manzanilla.\" But he doesn't drink Jerez in Spain before, brandy de Jerez from Fundador, after a few bottles of dry rioja.In Paris, however, he always has a siphon close at hand for his whiskey, and the fine is still in the water, but the wine remains dry, whether it is Piquette or Chateau-Margaux.He drinks dry and writes dry. He's Hemingway, but he's also his hero, Jacob (Jake) Barnes. A journalist who haunts bars and nightclubs in the Quartier Latin with friends thirsty as him and on both shores. From Montparnasse too. Americans like him. And in English sometimes. And an English one. A Unique. Lady Ashley. Brett has a boyish hairstyle. Who quickly becomes infatuated and passes from the arms to the arms. By love? But no! Infatuation, perhaps. Need escort, parade, never in the arms of Barnes. And yet. But it is impossible. They got to know each other; she is a volunteer nurse and hurts him. There's a nasty wound that keeps them from materializing their love. Since then, they turn around, and he follows his connections calmly.The reader travels with them for a long time in Paris until they decide to leave in a group for Spain, fish for trout, and especially for the feast of San Fermin in Pamplona. The Fiesta! Los Sanfermines! The bulls ran in the streets to the corrals, the bullring enclosures, and the Plaza de Toros. The raging crowd rushed past them. And the bullfights! The ballet of bullfighters and the smell of blood in the air! And eight days of festivities, fireworks, songs and dances, bands of jota dancers, bands of fifes and drums! It will be eight days of dreams and nightmares for the Barnes gang. Eight days of drunkenness, or they will explode. They will insult each other; they will fight, always for them. - or because of - the beautiful eyes of Brett, who, affirming his inconstant pose, will leave them, will reject the English of service which was to marry her to follow a beautiful toreador of 19 years. Inconstancy? Constance, instead, is in a love that she knows is impossible, unrealizable. And so the end of the book can only bring us back to its beginning, in a kind of loop without exit, without hope, dry, dry to prevent the tears from blooming:\"- Oh, Jake, \" said Brett, \" We could have been so happy together!In front of us, an officer in khaki controlled traffic from the top of his horse. He raised his staff. The cab suddenly slows down, pressing Brett against me.- Yes, I say. But, of course, it's always nice to think about. \"Very dry writing. Descriptions and dialogues. Without introspective passages. Without psychological explanations. And that gives a moving book. This work is the secret of Hemingway's \"iceberg writing\": it reveals what we see, and the reader senses the enormous mass of emotions that lurk beneath the surface. Some saw it as a description of the interior of the famous \"lost generation\" of Americans exiled in Paris; others as an ode to hedonism. I saw perhaps the opposite: a cry of alarm, a cry for help, and above all, a remarkable love story. Impossible, of course, for the most incredible compassion, for the most excellent emotion of the reader. And suppose we want at all costs to speak of a lost generation. In that case, it is perhaps the whole generation of the post-war period, the post-World War I, the horror of trenches. Still, it is precise to her that Hemingway dedicates the title of his book (after trying to call it Fiesta): The Sun Also Rises, the Sun Also Rises. After the night always comes the day. The Sun rises every day and will always give us light and hope. Precarious, not assured, but hope all the same.I will repeat myself, and you will forgive me: it is a remarkable love story."

        "user_review": "She Aches Just like a WomanI'll start off with something that I thought was interesting (hint: it borders on being annoying). For the first 75 pages, characters move in and out of this book with such swiftness and with no mention of physical description or notable characteristics, it mimics the effect of being at a really crowded party where you meet face after face, name after name and you have no time to process who is who, why they are significant and if you should even bother to remember them; so at the very least, the book is able to imitate the \"big-party-greeting\" that seems to permeate throughout the lives of the characters, but this only goes so far; that section is one long boring party that requires the minimum amount of your attention to understand what all these vapid, vacuous people are doing and what their current life drama is all about. Sure, there might be a great deal of interesting people moving in and out of your living room, but everyone is so focused on getting plastered drunk (on absinthe mind you), that no one cares about anything but what the most superficial impression of a person can yield.Whoo, my attempt at a complement turns into a nasty criticism and my struggle to appreciate Hemingway continues.The Iceberg Theory. Ya'll know it. It doesn't bear repeating but I will anyway. The gist of it is, is that in order to involve the reader as the author should, he must properly convey the depth of human emotion by giving the most minute of details, so that the full depth of a scene is communicatedimplicitlynot explicitly. The theory revolves around the idea that feelings unspoken, are more profound than feelings spoken. And up until this point, I couldn't agree with Hemingway more. How many times can you read a story thatgives it all away? What's the point of feeling the emotion of a story, if we have to be reminded that \"John is feeling sad. John cried\". It freezes the drama; the characters go stiff. Yet, I couldn't disagree more with Hemingway's execution of the iceberg theory. If words are to allude to a much deeper reservoir of meaning, then shouldn't eachwordbe dense, double-entendréd and deeply consequential? I am reminded time and time again, that there is a wrong way to take this theory. Plus I am overcome with the feeling thatall of poetry operates on this same principle, yet Hemingway writes the most dull and framework prose I've ever read. How could someone fully embrace the Iceberg Theory and then write a line like:\"It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches\"?A few lines earlierwe were told that they are in Spain. So Hemingway writes that the nice churches located in Spain are likenice Spanish churches. Ugh.Then there are literalchunksof this book that screamlook at me! Look how much I researched for this novel!, that contain descriptions making an american tourist of France's handbook seem like a high-octane thrill ride:\"We came unto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal. . . We walked along Port Royal until it became Mountparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne's, and all the little cafés, Damoy's, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.\"This is not what I read fiction for.There could be a lot of emotional depth coursing underneath all this banal prose, but it is all lost on me. I know that many people find this book to be their favorite of Hemingway, but without much action, where is the pleasure? Which I posit to be Hemingway's biggest strength. All the bull-fights and thecorriendo de los torroswere quite strong; they were the only things worthwhile,but there is still something that bothered me; why wasn't the heroic and idealized Pedro Romero killed? Wouldn't that have been so much more interesting/tragic/thematically significant in light of Hemingway's oft used \"failed masculinity\", if Pedro Romero had been killed? He is the ultimate symbol of macho libido; wouldn't that have played so well into a book about an impotent man? But instead we're told that a Vicente Girones died; who the fuck is that? Why do I even care? It's all this meaningless minutia of names and places, that fall completely flat and hardly engage me as a reader.I could learn a lot from Hemingway about how to properly write brutal violence or any scene where men face tough adversity. Heck, even the fishing trip is one of the more exciting parts of this book. Hemingway's strengths are on beautiful display inFor Whom the Bell Tolls. This is because the book is set during the Spanish Civil War. I even enjoyed the imitation Castilian Spanish, and needlessly translated dialogue; I felt that Hemingway had achieved a tone that befit the old-time feel of its characters and story, but without much of anything happening inThe Sun Also Rises, I can't say that this would be worth your time.One last thing, to tie in the review's title. I couldn't stand the main female character. Like not even for a few pages. I started to loath her so much, that I started to wonderis this the point?. Now, enough ink has been spilled over Papa Hemingway's possible sexist leanings, but this is one despicable cock-tease of a female protagonist. Whoever inspired him to feature such a lady to be theonly female character in the entire bookmust have given Hemingway's heart quite the roller coaster ride. That being said, this book was written in the 20's. And I have to maintain my rule of thumb that anything written before 1975 containing flagrant sexism or racism must be given a cultural pass. It's messed up, I know. But I must take the fact that there is a racial slur on every other page of this book with a grain of salt.As I read this review over, it really seems like I hated this book. Well I did. But there were parts that were great.So here's the thing.I will admit that I'm not one who takes to plot very often. I tend to err on the side of beautiful writing, even if it's for the sake of beautiful writing. I am willing to admit, at any time, that Hemingway is justnot for me. But I'm struggling to understand how Hemingway could be foranyone.I am always open to having my mind changed. That is what I love about this site. So please, make your case for the Papa! I want to hear why I'm wrong. Bring it on!Because I want to love Hemingway. I really do.p.s. Goodreads wouldn't let me post my real recommendation.It should say \"I would recommend to: Men who enjoy their women like their bull-fights, wild, violent and leaving a gaping hole where your heart used to be\""

        "user_review": "\"Everyone behaves badly\"—Jake\"You are all a lost generation\"—Gertrude SteinSince I had just found Everyone Behaves Badly: The Story Behind the Making of The Sun Also Rises; since I was meeting up with friend Brian, who wrote his MA thesis on this book; since I was flying from Chicago to Palm Springs to participate in a \"bachelor's party\" this weekend, and because the kind of excessive and regrettable bad behavior depicted in the book is also a feature of bachelor's parties and I thought it would be interesting to reflect on that IN that process, I decided to pull this classic novel off the shelf, dust it off and reread it on the plane here. I had the luxury of basically reading it in one sitting!The story takes place from Paris to Pamplona during the Fiesta we know now as featuring The Running of the Bulls. The centerpiece of the story is a woman, Lady Brett Ashley, whom my noir reading leads me to identify as Hemingway's characterization of a femme fatale, who ignites (or sometimes merely walks into a room and watches) a lot of drunken, jealous bad behavior over her, the young men lying in waste all around.\"She takes her razor from her boot, and a thousand pigeons fall around her feet\"—Tom WaitsThere's a lot of funny drinking talk and bar stories in this book that begins to wear on you over time, as they will and should, as Hem would have you experience it, as you learn to pay attention to the underlying tensions between various men over their fatal attraction to this strikingly attractive 34-year old woman. Jake, our American journalist Hem-based hero, injured \"down there\" during the war, would be Lady Brett's lover, but he can't consummate their love, and sex is apparently part of the regular daily diet of Brett with, among others, Mike, her Scottish fiancé; Bill, Jake's American fishing buddy; Robert Cohn, the writer and amateur boxer whose skills in the latter figure in a scene we build toward in the whole book, and Pedro Romero, a 19-year old bull fighter, with a true aficion for bullfighting, and, as it turns out, older women. Jake is still in love with Brett, but kind of just watches in anguish as this train wreck unfolds.When I was reading it in my early twenties I wanted to be one of those expatriates, reading and writing and drinking my way through Europe with other people my age, and I did go there in my twenties to zig zag across the continent and hang out with people from all over the place, from Paris to Pamplona, from Florence to London, from Amsterdam to Zurich, my backpack on my back. But now I feel less charitable about these folks behaving badly, and see this bad-behaving as largely the point of the book this time around.\"You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed with sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafes.\"This \"lostness\" of people living in \"arrested development,\" not sure what their futures hold, not sure how to live their lives, aching for something that happens to be largely fleeting. Hemingway's departures from the drunken lust--classic descriptions of fishing and Romero's bullfighting (yes, I know they are murdering bulls)--have a kind of (intended) purity to cleanse the palate of Jake, who at one point, sick of it all, says \"To hell with people\". Hemingway's moral/social code gets established early on: Independence, faithfulness, connections to nature, and acute powers of observation.\"In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work.\"I think this may be only my third time reading it; while this is Brian's favorite Hem, I have liked A Farewell to Arms, Old Man and the Sea and (especially) the stories better. But despite the fact that Hem damaged a lot of friendships by writing this book (the fictional characters were thinly disguised portraits of all the friends he drank with there), it is nevertheless really well-written, has passages in it lyrical enough to bring tears to your eyes, and is in my opinion still one one of the greats of American literature, a companion for another tale of misguided desire and wrecked lives, The Great Gatsby.\"Oh Jake,\" Brett said, \"We could have had such a damned good time together.\"Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly, pressing Brett against me.\"Yes,\" I said. \"Isn't it pretty to think so?\"—SunUh."

        "user_review": "Can't quite believe this was not only Hemingway's first novel, but my first Hemingway book since The Old man and the sea years ago. And, pardon the pun, this completely blew that out the water! Why did it take so long for me to get to him again? Just so glad that I did. His spare writing style, which went down a treat with me, is deceptively simple and just so readable that I found it a struggle to put the book down most of the time. I didn't want to leave it's company. I felt right at home within these pages. Wine glass in one hand, book in the other. Bliss. Starting off in Paris before relocating to Spain, Hemingway's novel in a nutshell focuses on the anguished love affair between the expatriate American war veteran Jake Barnes and the Lady Brett Ashley, an early sort of femme fatale that was representative in the writer's mind of 1920s womanhood. For some, the heart and highlight of the novel is the bullfighting later on, but for me I just loved the whole darn thing equally, without the need to pick out one particular moment.So then, Jake and his buddies head off to Spain, to fish, to witness Pamplona's Festival, the bullfighting, sinking bottle after bottle as they restlessly move from bar to bar, cafe to bar, and cafe to cafe. It sounds like parade! but all this comes at a cost, as the party that always seems to be in full swing slowly starts to crack. With all that sun, booze, and late nights the tension between the characters escalates, and everyone that seeks a connection in some way always ends up alone and disappointed come morning. In a way the the novel produces the effect of a terrible hangover as we move around in circles between the characters as they drink, eat, drink, and drink some more. Some may bemoan that things do get repetitive, but maybe that's the whole point. This group of wanderers simply don't want the party to end. It's like that melancholic feeling of lapping up the final days of summer knowing it won't be long before the clouds and the rain come along and spoil everything.Parts reminded me of F. Scott Fitzgerald, so certainly no harm done there, and the love affair of Jake and the lovely, impulsive tease that is Lady Brett Ashley might easily have descended into bathos. It is an erotic attraction which is destined from the start to be frustrated and doomed. Hemingway has such a sure hold on his values that he makes an absorbingly tender narrative out of it. When Jake and Brett fall in love, and know, with that complete absence of reticence of the war generation, that nothing can be done about it, the thing might well have ended there and then. But Hemingway shows uncanny skill in prolonging it and delivering it of all its implications. He makes his characters say one thing, convey still another, and when a whole passage of talk has been given, the reader finds himself the richer by a totally unexpected mood, a mood often enough of outrageous familiarity with obscure heartbreaks.I simply loved it, and was dazzled from start to finish!"

It also shows the pretentiousness of the character through the association with Princeton. It is almost the prototypical Hemmingway prose as well being dry and direct and to the point. The reference to boxing which is a violent, masculine sport, gives us an inkling of the bull fighting that will become the center of this early 20th century masterpiece.The relationship between Jake and Brett is an old one of disappointment and resignation, Brett always doomed to make poor decisions and Jake always doomed to clean up the messes she leaves behind.The great irony I find in Hemingway is that he uses a very direct language with a limited vocabulary and repetition, and yet there is an incredible subtlety here. Jake's wartime injury castrated him, but we only learn this by inference: when Georgette tries to touch him there, he moves her hand away and says he's sick, later with Brett their contact is limited to kisses and he cries when she leaves him, he observes himself naked in the mirror in his room and only then does he talk in roundabout terms about getting injured in the war and how the other officers made a joke about it. As a result of this castration, and his inbred anti-Semitism, he acts as a entremetteur in trying to tempt his erstwhile friend Robert Cohn into infidelity at the beginning of the book when he mentions the girl in Strasbourg in front of his wife, Frances. Tragically, this playing matchmaker later backfires on him when he learns that Brett has spent a weekend in Bayonne with Robert rather than coming to Spain with him.It is admittedly upsetting to see Hemingway's anti-Semitism in his description of how Robert had \" a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak.\" (p. 10) There is also unveiled homophobia in Jake's hostile reaction to the gay men with whom Brett shows up to the bal musette in the Latin quarter: \"Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you are should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure.\" (p. 20) Note the alliteration there, \" swing, shatter, superior, simpering\"; that is one of the great markers of Hemingway's writing that makes one want to forgive him for his many many faults. In that same section, the phrase \"with them was Brett\" is repeated twice reemphasizing how Jake's sudden feeling of violence is tied up in his own impotence - they are gay and will not make love to her either, but this just reminds him of how much he would like to making him more angry. It is a lot to unpack, but the terse prose brings out all this nervousness in the words themselves.I had forgotten that most of the novel takes place in Paris entre-guerres and recall that the first time I read this 3 decades ago or more, I had never seen much less dreamed of living in Paris. And so it goes.Late in the book when Jake returns briefly to France before a final return to Spain, he makes a comment about French servers not having a \"my friend\" attitude and that you get what you pay for - I have found this to be the case and despite my past annoyance with arrogant French service, it is true that pedantic, over-friendly service elsewhere in desperate attempts to solicit a tip is even more annoying.I love Papa's writing: the spartan use of language, the evocation of things in such an abbreviated, staccato manner…and I had also forgotten how much drinking goes on in this book!One day before I am too old, I truly want to see a bullfight in Pamplona. Some day….Don't miss my review of the Meyer biography of Hemingway:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

        "user_review": "Occasionally, I find a book from my early days on Goodreads when I only did star ratings and I like to go back and revisit it with a review. This month we are reading The Sun Also Rises for one of my book clubs, so I figured this would be the perfect opportunity to do so. I previously gave it 3 stars but, upon reflection, I am thinking I might push it closer to 4 stars. So, maybe 3.5 stars (rounded up on the official star ranking).While I cannot say I enjoyed my experience with this book as much as I did with some other Hemingway, I am very glad I read this one. Whether you end up liking it or not I truly believe it is one of the essential Hemingway novels to read; both style and content. After reading The Sun Also Rises, I readThe Paris Wife, which is a historical fiction novel with a lot of non-fictional references in it, and realized just how autobiographical this book was.Also, this book is one of the quintessential novels of the Lost Generation. The Lost Generation was a literary movement coming out of World War I and included, in addition to Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot, and others (I must admit I had to go to Wikipedia to make to sure I had this list of authors correct!) While I was reading more about the Last Generation I realized how much the narrative of this book represented the mentality and artistic representation of that group. It's the perfect companion novel if you want to know more about that time and Hemingway himself.While I don't often do this with books I have given 3.5 stars to, I do recommend this one for its classic status. It has so much to offer beyond just being a novel and it just might send you down a rabbit hole looking for other books from and information about this era."

        "user_review": "\"I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it.\"\"Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.\"I picked up this book as part of my ongoing plan to work through the Pop Chart 100 Essential Novels list. Despite what I'm about to say, I don't really quibble with this book's inclusion. Ernest Hemingway is going to have a book on this list, and his debut novel—with its famous depictions of the running of the bulls and bullfighting in Pamplona—is apparently his best book and a quintessential example of his writing style of short sentences and understated descriptions. The novel so full of themes and symbols—masculinity, naturalism, sex, drinking, bullfighting—that I don't know how I got out of AP American Literature 30+ years ago without being required to read it (or at least the Cliff's Notes version 😄).Unfortunately, none of that intellectual understanding made my reading experience ofThe Sun Also Risesany better. Jake Barnes—a great character name, by the way—was injured in the war in some unexplained way that has left him impotent. He loves Lady Brett Ashley, but their sexless relationship is merely platonic, making his mounting frustration throughout the novel perfectly understandable. Brett is a surprisingly modern character. She's in her mid-thirties and engaged, but she doesn't want kids and regularly sleeps with other men with her fiancé's knowledge. But running from her problems into the arms of other men doesn't make her happy. Instead, she just keeps hurting herself and the men who fall into her orbit, most of all Robert Cohn. And if there is a reason to exclude this book from lists of great novels, it's the casual antisemitism directed at Cohn throughout the novel. It's never made clear that Cohn is a perpetual outsider because he's a Jew, but the other characters can't stop mentioning that he's a Jew, and one uses a slur, so it seems like more than coincidence.But more importantly, it's hard to overstate just how little happens inThe Sun Also Rises. There's an interlude where Jake and a friend go fishing, which symbolically contrasts with Paris and Pamplona but is not terribly interesting. The descriptions of the running of the bulls and the bullfighting at the Festival of San Fermin are cool. But you would have to read this book for yourself to truly understand how much of it is just characters running into each other while eating and/or drinking, and then talking about food and/or alcohol:I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee.The characters come together and go their separate ways in varying combinations throughout the story, but with little character development or growth. Instead, they all remain so unhappy, seemingly waiting for some purpose in life that they never find.The Sun Also Risesis aroman á clef, in that the novel is apparently a fictionalized version of the time he and some specific, real people spent in Paris and Spain in the early 1920s. Even though I doubt that this sliver of American expats living in Paris fairly portrays that generation as a whole, my primary takeaway from this novel is a great sense of pity for that so-called Lost Generation who came of age in WWI. But understanding and pity doesn't make the aimless, self-destructive lifestyle of a half-dozen unhappy characters interesting, and can't salvage what is, ultimately, a rather dull story."

        "user_review": "The Sun Also Risesis the story of a \"lost generation\", a group of British and American ex-pats who were ex-servicemen of World War I. Being himself belonging to this lost generation, Hemingway digs deep into their lives subtly exposing and bringing to light the true nature of that generation. He points out that despite the irretrievable physical and emotional damages they have faced, these men have braved their lives with sheer courage and have lived as normal a life as possible under the circumstances.The story takes you through a colorful journey with the main protagonist Jake Barnes and his friends on Paris cafes, French food; on Bayonne and fishing; and finally, on Pamplona and bullfighting, all the time bringing out in slow measures the hidden characteristics of these characters.The character of Lady Brett is the center of the story. She is Hemingway's easel in which he paints his story with such mastery. Through her, Hemingway exhibits two important points: One is the concept of the \"modern woman\", who no longer lives according to social norms defining her own rules based on freedom. Second is the sexual tension and sexual frustration of men when attraction and denial are played at close proximity. Through the characters of Jake Barnes and Robert Cohn, this point is subtly exposed.There is also another interesting feature in the story; that is the nothingness these characters feel, living day to day, trying desperately to find a solid ground to anchor their wandering lives. This point is even true today. It is not only the \"lost generation\" but even the modern generation find them victims of this nothingness. And to that extent, the story is timeless."

This time I chose the audiobook. William Hurt was perfect for me. I read so many one star ratings on his performance— saying he didn't have the right accent— that he trashed Hemingway's magnificent masterpiece….NOT for me —I loved WilliamHurt's voice - his reading… helped redeemed my faith in Ernest Hemingway.This is another recently read book without much plot….(didn't matter to me one iota).but I adored the dialogue- those testosterone conversations, the art-of-drinking, (haha),buddy-chatting, women-everything, watching bullfights, traveling, walking, the beaches…and best of all,Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley had my heart….and…as for Hemingway's delicious prose (in this book anyway)….well, nobody is more surprised than me at how much I 5tenjoyed this deceased distinguished classic author.Hallelujah!

        "user_review": "I've read this story before, many times. The interesting thing is how different each approach is to telling the story of the appearance and evolution of life on Earth. Carl Sagan approaches it with reverent awe, one of the Universe's great mysteries.Bill Bryson, on the other hand, took an outsider's view, since he is not really \"in\" on the whole paleontology thing. AndTerry Pratchettand his buddies told the tale through the eyes of the Wizards of the Unseen University, which always makes things interesting.Fortey's approach is somewhat different. He got into this by being a student of the Ancient, and has been studying the history of life since his boyhood. So, his take on the story is one of excited discovery. He does a very nice job at explaining just how thrilling it is to find a fossil tooth in a place where no one had found fossil teeth before, or why the fact that chalk is made of countless billions of dead sea creatures is cause for wonder.He was thrilled to find his first trilobite back when he was fourteen, and the thrill has never worn off. It is a testament to his talent that he is able to transmit that enthusiasm and love of the science to his writing. He takes us through the four billion years of life's evolution, keeping it interesting whether its the miracle of the cell or the miracle of the Homo sapiens diaspora.If you're interested in how you got here - and you want to kick some \"intelligent design\" nutbars in the ass - you'll enjoy this book."

        "user_review": "Great book but as much as I enjoyed it I'd recommend one of his more recent books instead. Fortey is one of those rare science writers that combines a gift for explanation with the rare feat of being a great writer and often invokes a Saganesque beauty of science. His description of tetrapods wandering across Pangaea as 'perfectly pandemic perambulation' and his constant inclusion of numberless quotes of fine literature and poetry sucks the reader in (in a way another British science author, who shall not be named, has always failed miserly at.)The religious language used in chapter two and in the conclusion as a means to show how an acceptance of science need not contradict ones beliefs was, I admit, a bit distasteful for a godless heathen like myself, but it's all for a good cause, is brief and is done is a way tasteful enough to make me consider giving this book to my science-hostile friends in hopes that Fortey can win them over.The thing I like best is Fortey's rather valiant attempt to give each period of geologic time the attention it deserves rather than concentrating on what is only most interesting to us humans and focusing on that disproportionately. Sure, most science books I've read mention how single-cell life makes up most of our biologic history and how very long the process of oxygenation of the atmosphere really took but it's always a fleeting mention whereas Fortey really makes you feel and appreciate the long passage of time these things entail. Fortey has a gift for really fleshing out the history of life on Earth and really making one appreciate the immense scale of geologic time in a way most pop science books do not."

        "user_review": "Fortey, an exceptionally engaging science writer, takes us on a tour through four billion years of natural history. His review is neither focused nor comprehensive but more of a wide ranging travelogue touching on each period in evolutionary history and the author's explorations. The high points are his evocative descriptions of landforms, flora and fauna both present and past. We traverse the terrain with him on his fossil collecting expeditions to remote corners of the world where he describes what the earth and its inhabitants must have looked like in eras long ago. For example, he takes your imagination to a primitive Carboniferous forest with giant millipedes and dragon flies as big as seagulls.Fortey discusses the process and history of paleontology as he describes the progression of the flora and fauna through time. He includes his own personal experience and that of other paleontologists. It's a big topic and a short book so Fortey offers up selected bite sized portions of the activity of each era. He describes the cyanobacteria and microbes that formed floating mats in the ocean 3,000 million years ago (mya) leaving their vestiges in fossilized stromatolites. Then he moves onto the Cambrian period (520 mya), its explosion of multicellular life and his personal specialty, trilobites, about which he has a separate book. So we get good coverage of these extinct arthropods along with graptolites and other creatures that prospered in the Ordovician. After 60% of marine species expire at the end of the Ordovician (443 mya), Fortey moves on to the Silurian when bony fish proliferate and plants and animals invade the coasts, streams and rivers ending with the conquest of land in the Devonian . Sadly a late Devonian extinction (375 mya) left only one order of Forty's beloved trilobites. Fortey then gives us a succinct overview of the dinosaurs and their demise in the Permian extinction (250 mya) which also took out the last trilobite after a 270 million year run. Lastly he covers mammals that interest him including hominids right up to the Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.While a fun quick spin through the eras, I do have some quibbles. It's difficult to keep track of the flow of life from period to period amidst Fortey's frequent diversions into the history of fossil discovery and his personal expeditions. Also, he often refers just to the period name without dates. I found myself going on line frequently to be sure I had the time periods and their creatures in proper relation to each other. The book lacks time line charts, an odd omission, although it has many excellent pictures of specimens and locations. His use of extended analogies often seems contrived. In one case he compares the rise and demise of animals in the ecosystem to the changes in orchestras as new instruments appeared and old ones disappeared over the centuries. In another he compares the ever increasing size of dinosaurs to the trend of ever bigger black pepper grinders in Italian restaurants. I would have been happier with less fluff. Still I enjoyed the book. Other readers may find his style a welcome relief from books that can overwhelm with one scientific detail after another."

I have always loved paleontology and use this book as a basis for the teaching that I have done on the subject.I have found it a very useful starting point for further research on the fossils which catch my attention. It is starting to show its age, as science moves on and a lot has been discovered since the book's publication, but it still provides a thoughtful history of life on earth."

        "user_review": "This isn't my favourite of Fortey's books, possibly because I've read similar types of books by other writers before, so he isn't bringing me a new subject I don't expect to like in the same way as he was in his books about geology, or a key passion of his as in his book about trilobites (though trilobites have their place here, too, as you'd expect with Fortey). Still, I enjoy the way he writes and the way he draws together his themes, and this isn't abadbook -- it's just that he and others have covered a lot of this ground before.Actually, my favourite history-of-evolution type book is Richard Dawkins'The Ancestor's Tale. (When Dawkins sticks to science, he's great. When he decides to comment on twitter, rarely so.) That's just a quirk of the way he organises it, though, while Fortey's method is a little less organised, lingering on things of special interest to him. Which is fine, but didn't work so well for me in this case. That, and he doesn't deal with DNA as much as I'd like, because that's my special interest and not his.Nonetheless, Fortey knows his stuff and how to make it enjoyable, though I think I can understand people who complain about his writing style not beingeasy-- I tend to take it slow and savour it, myself."

        "user_review": "Like Richard Fortey, one of my own first experiences of the full biography of life on Earth was Disney's animation of Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, in the film Fantasia. This book is a more accurate and complete version of the same. At the time he wrote this, Fortey was a senior paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, and a frequent BBC guest. I had previously read hisHorseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms: The Story of the Animals and Plants That Time Has Left Behind(US title), and enjoyed it enough to seek out this earlier and more foundational book.More than the story told by paleontology, this book is also the story of paleontology, with Fortey relating his personal experiences and perspectives on various episodes in the history of the field. Chapters are arranged chronologically, starting with the inception of life on Earth four billion years ago, moving through his own specialization during and around the Ordovician Period, up to just before the onset of recorded history. As you might expect, his writing is best when working in those fascinating undersea and early terrestrial worlds of the Cambrian through Permian Periods of the Paleozoic Era. Outside that area of his passion, the origins of life are better explained and understood from the perspective of molecular biology. And after those periods, he acknowledges the intense popular fascination with dinosaurs and early humans and turns more to stories of the paleontologists themselves – and he is someone to know them.All together it is a thorough, if light, overview. One shortcoming is that the book is now 23 years old, and state-of-the-understanding has changed in a few areas. The other is his showy style of writing. I think he must see himself as an entertaining polymath, drawing frequent references to classical literature of the British educated class. I speak the American dialect of the same language, and do not share that background. I'm aware of the references, but they are just not the touchstone for me that they must be for his audience.In summary, I appreciated the book, but I did not find it as fascinating as his book on fossil species that have survived with only small adaptation into modern times."

        "user_review": "This is my second book by Richard Fortey, retired paleontologist and science writer. I complained in the past about Fortey's flowery writing style but once I settle into his books, I find myself enjoying it so I am not going to take any stars away. For a science writer, he puts a lot of effort into his use of english to write what I find to be very engrossing science books about one of my favorite subjects, paleontology.I liked that the book focused on the little stuff...the microorganisms that transformed the earth during the proterozoic and the slow evolution of larger organisms in the oceans and the latter movement onto land that ended in the permian. This incredibly long time period encapsulating many millions of years in geologic time is really what set the stage for everything that came after. Dinosaurs, mammals and ultimately humans are not covered as extensively but still get their due.I own a copy of a large format picture book published by Dorling Kindersley titled Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth. I found it very useful to follow along in this picture book as I read Life. Fortey's chapters roughly covered geological time periods...ordovician, devonian, etc...which is how Prehistoric Life is laid out as well. It was enlightening to see the actual fossils Fortey describes and just added to what I learned about this time period in earth's history.A thoroughly enjoyable overview of life on earth."

However, his story is not a boring slog through the strata, but an eclectic stroll among fascinating organisms. Fortey includes many asides in his narrative, including important aspects of geology, portraits of eccentric paleontologists and personal anecdotes about fossil hunting is unusual locations. This book manages to summarise paleontological controversies in a fair manner without bogging down the story. I found the author's descriptive writing style to be rich and lyrical."

        "user_review": "WithLife: An Unauthorized Biography, British palaeontologistRichard Forteyattempts to pen down four billion years of life and evolution on earth for his readers in only 400 pages total. An ambitious aim, to be sure, and one that Fortey manages to live up to, though perhaps not in ways everybody might've expected (and there's no doubt that he's had to sacrifice a large amount of detail in order to fit four billion years into 400 pages).First and foremost, this is in no way a book that can be considered an academic textbook, since Fortey spends a lot of time weaving his own story as a beginning scientist through his tales of life's history. I didn't find this annoying or distracting, because I enjoyed the wonderment and enthusiasm it brought me via his own personal experiences, especially when he starts detailing his first big findings and expeditions. However, I can imagine that some readers, especially those with more advanced knowledge of the field, might be looking for something more than the image of a joyous young Fortey digging up his first trilobite. In short, something in a format closer to that of a textbook or a scientific book, giving more information and scrapping a lot of the autobiographical parts.I didn't mind this though, and thought it brought a lot of life (no pun intended) to the book. Fortey's style of writing was quite accessible, and his passion and enthusiasm for his own field of work managed to spark my interest even more as I read on. Very engaging, though I did have problems with the fact that Fortey always refers to practically every single species that turns up by its Latin name, sometimes without explaining what the life form in question actually is (or in a very vague manner). And I, being the\"… curious and intelligent but perhaps mildly uninformed reader\"that's described on the back cover of my edition (with emphasis on the 'uninformed'), couldn't always keep up with this. It led to many frustrated look-ups, and made me wonder: why do this if curious yetuninformedpeople are your aimed audience?Another thing that bothered me is that Fortey doesn't provide any information on scientists and/or researchers other than himself who have had a hand in providing the information that we now have on the origin and development of life. Along with the references and sources that, well, simply weren't present, this felt like something that was truly missing from the book.Anyhow, let's get back to the other good parts, shall we? I liked both style and most of the general substance in this book, and was particularly smitten with the chapters on the very earliest stages of life, and those on dinosaurs. Throughout this entire book, Fortey also stresses the importance of the fossil record, and how much we can actually learn from it. I also thought the links he made to plate tectonics to be superb, but I might be a little biased here since that is one of my own favourite topics.In conclusion, I thought this was a solid read and I think Fortey was brave when attempting to write something like this. Though near impossible, he sincerely tries to provide his audience with as many details as he can within the confines of 400 pages, yet ultimately fails a little in this goal. His enthusiasm was catching, I enjoyed the book wholeheartedly, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a book on life's history with an autobiographical tone."

        "user_review": "After Fortey'sEarth: An Intimate Historynearly turned me into a geologist, I had pretty high expectations of 'Life.' In some respects, these were met. Fortey's prose is very nice, his metaphors creative, and his references erudite. Yet this book was fundamentally lacking most of the things I was looking for it - expectations I had no right to expect it to fulfill, really.I was disappointed first of all that Fortey really doesn't cite sources. If he had, anything I felt he'd short-shrifted would have been easy to continue digging into on my own. I was also disappointed that Life lacked the in-depth character histories of scientists and their discoveries that made Earth so great. This was not absent, but merely underdeveloped.I had been hoping in general for more detail, more information, and a greater sense of thoroughness and connection. The book felt superficial - I knew most of the material going in, and had been hoping for more of a focus on the broad changes in Earth's geochemistry and, for instance, how climatic cycles and supercontinent cycles interacted with evolution. This was tantalizingly alluded to frequently, but never approached more explicitly or in any detail.It is interesting to see Fortey treat evolution as a given but prove it in some ways much more convincingly than Dawkins' Blind Watchmaker. The fossil record is indomitable evidence – how else could you explain it? It's disappointing that Fortey doesn't discuss evolution in any more interesting ways though. I mean, it's the subject of his book, after all. He doesn't ever really seem interested in the connections between periods and the forces driving change, though. He just sort of tells what happens and then apologizes for writing as though there were any kind of intentional progress involved.If you're new to the history of life (i.e., young) then this book would be great for you. If you're already into it, you probably shouldn't waste your time."

In most part, it is every bit as brilliantly written as the professional reviews promise: a lively, captivating narrative on the history of life itself, deserving of its name as a classic of the pop-science genre. On the other hand, that great narrative is regularly interrupted with completely irrelevant stuff, i.e. pointless (in my eyes) personal reminiscences of what type of tobacco some researcher liked to smoke, or how bad the food was in some Italian restaurant. I wouldn't have minded that much if it were just a handful of occurrences, but there was so much of that that I found it awfully distracting. I would very much prefer to see more space dedicated to further details on the subject of the book, and more apparatus as well, for there is only a very short glossary included at the end, helpful but hardly sufficient for a 'mildly uninformed reader' whom the book is supposed to be targeting as it says on the back cover."

        "user_review": "To many Americans, and nearly all young ones, paleontology can be summed up in one word: dinosaurs. Amid all the current dinomania, in fact, it is easy to forget that the dinosaurs constitute only one small chapter of the history of life, which is filled with countless tales of creatures equally engaging, if not as large. This imbalance is skillfully redressed in Richard Fortey's ''Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth,'' an account of the history of life incorporating much of the latest research. Surprisingly, this is the first popular but scholarly narrative of life's history written by a professional (Fortey is a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London).By filling this empty niche Fortey performs a valuable service, for to understand evolution we must begin with the facts of life, the biological history of earth. His tale is not a boring slog through the strata, but an eclectic waltz among organisms at once extraordinary and extinct, the ''endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful'' admired by Darwin in ''The Origin of Species.'' With a deep understanding of his science, extensive experience prospecting for fossils and considerable writing skills, Fortey brings to life not only dinosaurs and fossils of human ancestors but also less renowned creatures like bear-sized rodents, dragonflies with five-foot wingspans and carnivorous kangaroos.Reconstructing the slow process of evolution is not an easy job, but paleontologists occupy an advantageous position. While other students struggle to understand evolution by observing living species, paleontologists have a direct window on the history of life. For them, evolution is written in the rocks. Their work is plagued, however, with its own special difficulties. As Fortey notes, fossils represent a biased and eccentric sample of life's story. Fragile, squishy, or land-dwelling organisms are less likely to be preserved than heavier-boned or marine creatures, and much of the fossil record is either buried too deep for access or has been destroyed by the endless churning of the earth's crust. It has been estimated that fewer than 1 percent of all the species that ever lived are known to us through fossils.Despite these problems, the past two decades have brought rapid prog-ress in understanding the development of life. Fortey does not merely recite this history chronologically; he focuses on recent, major evolutionary finds. These include a remarkable series showing the evolution of whales from their terrestrial ancestors, and evidence for an ''arms race'' that occurred 150 million years ago when the sudden rise of a fierce array of marine predators -- including venomous octopods, drilling snails and shell-crushing crabs and fish -- touched off a round of defensive adaptations in their helpless prey.Fortey enhances his basic story with many asides, including lessons on relevant aspects of geology (such as continental drift and the dating of rocks), entertaining portraits of eccentric paleontologists and many tales of his experiences on fossil digs throughout the world. The book opens with a long and lively account of his first expedition, a six-month trip to the island of Spitsbergen, during which numbing cold, bad food and personal squabbles all but prevented his team from mining a rare cache of 500-million-year-old Ordovician fossils. Among biologists, field ecologists tend to be seen as ''tough guys,'' forever grappling with lions or pythons in obscure parts of the world. Now, however, I have a new respect for paleontologists as they engage in their own perpetual battles with unforgiving rock.Finally, Fortey details many recent controversies in paleontology, including the debate about the demise of the dinosaurs. Here he provides a much-needed correction of Stephen Jay Gould's famous conclusions about the creatures of the Burgess Shale, an area of the Canadian Rockies rich in fossils. In his book ''Wonderful Life,'' Gould portrays these bizarre animals as victims of ''bad luck'' who died without issue, bolstering his view that much of present life reflects a blind and random pruning of an earlier and vastly more diverse world. As Fortey notes, Burgess Shale animals are now known to be forerunners of existing species, undermining Gould's claim that if evolution were replayed, the vagaries of chance would populate the modern world with creatures substantially different from those we know.While Fortey has corrected some of Gould's scientific conclusions, he has also borrowed some of his literary tendencies. Just as museums have evolved from places of science to palaces of entertainment (a trend loudly decried by Fortey), so popular writing on evolution has developed from spare but gracefully descriptive prose to the jazzed-up style favored by Gould, studded with digressions, rhetorical flourishes and obscure literary allusions. Fortey has obviously been influenced by this trend, and while his tangential material often spices up the text, it occasionally makes the book hard to digest. Exercised by some particularly juicy fossil, Fortey sometimes lapses into overheated prose, extended metaphors (including an unfortunate comparison of evolutionary arms races to the increasing size of pepper mills in Italian restaurants), or breezy but annoying interpolations (dilating on the persistence of an ancient plant, he suddenly exclaims ''Live and let liverwort!''). The text, though eminently readable, would have been improved by including more bones and fewer bon mots.The weakest chapter is the penultimate one, describing human evolution and the rise of society. This is well-trodden ground that has received better coverage in several recent books. After telling the tale of hominids, still subject to much controversy, Fortey cannot resist a detour into philosophical territory. He concludes that two features set us apart from all other animals: our consciousness and our ability to deceive other members of our species. Both claims are dubious. Although consciousness is a thorny problem, many behaviorists have concluded that it is widespread in primates and other animals. Moreover, members of many species deceive their fellows. Some male fish, for example, pretend to be female in appearance and behavior, a deception that allows them to approach spawning males and steal their mates.Because it is largely a recitation of facts, ''Life'' lacks the intellectual challenge that permeates some popular accounts of evolution; readers weaned on the writings of Gould or Richard Dawkins may feel the need for thicker gruel. While the book dwells on the products of evolution and not the forces producing them, much of the attraction of paleontology lies in pondering the mechanisms driving the process. Readers wanting a fuller picture should follow the ingestion of ''Life'' with a digestif of Dawkins, who has written several absorbing books on the power of natural selection.Nevertheless, no one can finish ''Life'' without having accrued considerable knowledge of evolutionary history and a sense of the excitement of discovery that can be conveyed only by a professional scientist chipping away at the rock face of his discipline. Anyone with the slightest interest in biology should read this book, pass it along to those who think that paleontology begins and ends with dinosaurs and then reflect on the many other curious creatures that, as part of the missing 99 percent of the history of life, will be forever unknown to us."

        "user_review": "This is a non-fiction highlight of the year!Fortey recounts 4 billion years of natural history from a macroevolutionary perspective, but doesn't waste time with polemics or with justifying the neo-Darwinian synthesis. This isn't an argument for evolution, but a narrative that assumes it. I'm content with the assumption, but others may not be......which is a pity for them, because Fortey is a master stylist. It's not as though he couldn't have resorted to the \"popular\" style championed by Richard Dawkins and his fellow fundamentalist reductionists; this book came out in 1997, long after the success of \"The Selfish Gene\". Unlike them, Fortey doesn't sacrifice substance or style in a condescending effort to reach \"the common man.\" He respects his reader enough to toss not merely challenging scientific words at him, but lyrical descriptions of Precambrian oceans and Carboniferous forests, fragments of poetry, and fascinating anecdotes about scientists past. The effect is elevating, not just informing -- although it is that, too!Whether as natural history or even just as literature, this book is a gem."

        "user_review": "Richard Fortey has almost done the impossible, describing in vivid, elegant prose, the history of life on Earth in a mere 322 pages. Yet I fear he gives too cursory a treatment; one which have benefited immensely from including additional drawings, diagrams, and perhaps, photographs, offering readers more visual insights on Planet Earth's rich biological history. Among his finest achievements are his excellent descriptions of cladistics as an important methodological tool for classifying animal species and higher taxa (The best I've read in popular science literature so far.), the role of plate tectonics in influencing the history of life, dinosaurs, and the terminal Cretaceous mass extinction which killed off non-avian dinosaurs. Although his professional specialty is invertebrate paleobiology, Fortey does an admirable job describing the conquest of the land by plants and arthropods and the terrestrial reptilian and mammalian faunas which follow.I also commend his frequent insights on the history of paleontology, offering interesting vignettes which give readers an inside look on paleontology as a profession. He opens with an introductory chapter about his graduate education that ought to appeal to anyone thinking of pursuing paleontology as a vocation. It's cast in vivid, exciting prose that could be drawn from the pages of a bestselling thriller. Yet there are some major omissions. Fortey dismisses or ignores the important contributions of University of Chicago paleontologists David Raup and the late Jack Sepkoski in transforming paleontology into a more rigorous, statistically oriented science. And he ignores major contributions from other important American paleontologists such as Niles Eldredge (However, he does cite Eldredge in his bibliography.), George Gaylord Simpson, and Steven M. Stanley, to name but a few, in favor of those from Great Britain. Judging from Fortey's comments, you might think that Stephen Jay Gould was the most important 20th Century American paleontologist. So anyone who thinks that this is simultaneously an excellent history of paleontology and an elegant history of life will be sadly mistaken.Despite its numerous flaws, I do recommend Fortey's book, as the most succinct overview of the history of life on Earth yet published.(Reposted from my 2001 Amazon review)"

        "user_review": "An incredibly journey starting with a cosmological timeline and the formation of the planets, moving into a geological timeline covering the earliest days of planet Earth and several hundred million years of 'planetary evolution'. Starting when Earth begins to take shape from base materials in the solar system orbiting the sun, moving forward to the first single cell lifeforms appearing in the fossil records, how the early atmosphere was formed by cellular life, and how each successive generation of life had an impact on the planet and atmosphere - which led to yet another batch of evolutionary changes and developments.Single celled life thrived and eventually came together building colonies, groups, and adapting until simple celled life grew into more complex forms. Eventually clusters of single celled life gave way to multi-cellular life which had effects on the planet and atmosphere, which in turn led to more adaptation and more evolutionary steps. Multi-cellular life gave way to more complex forms and bigger forms of life, each step taking thousands upon thousands, millions upon millions of years. Each small step either failing to continue or leading to something new, eventually the small steps added up to medium steps, those led to larger and larger steps as life grew more complex.The Folio Society edition did have a bit of a textbook feel to me, but not in a bad way. It was a very well put together book with detailed graphics and images demonstrating many of the steps taken over time."

        "user_review": "Many years ago, when I was back in the university, there were certain professors who were the undisputed masters of storytelling. They'd tell you about the meal they had the night before. They'd talk - non-stop- about their awesomeness, and they'd always find an excuse to tell you about their personal lives. The interesting thing is that they were 'supposed' to lecture on certain subjects, and if you were patient enough, you'd find out that this they did, occasionally, when they were not talking about their last meal. Many students loved them: those professors were so awesome after all! These student loved them because instead of hearing a boring scientific lecture, the professors would lecture about their marital problems, personal drama, and interesting adventures in Thailand. How romantic! Students loved those professors! Because while listening to stories, they got the illusion that they were doing something scientific.I hated those professors. They wasted my time with their stories. They forgot that I did not attend those classes for stories. I had no interest in their adventures in Thailand. I didn't care about Thai girls.Reading this book was a very nostalgic experience. It reminded me of those 'awesome' professors and their adventures in Thailand.Some chapters are better than others, especially towards the end of the book. So, now that I have finished the book, I have to increase my rating from 2 to 3. Nevertheless, this book is far from scientific, and there is to little to learn."

Still, I learned a few things I didn't know before (did you know the ancestors to whales and dolphins had legs?) and it was a worthwhile read."

        "user_review": "Low 4. Fortey has provided an accessible and highly informative account of evolution. The book follows a line of development which mirrors 'stratigraphy' – the study of sedimentary rocks and the fossil faunas they contain, thus dating the emergence of all life-forms - in following a linear trajectory through history of life on Earth. What such analysis reveals is that there have been clear moments in the history of the Earth in which a cataclysmic event, such as the impact of a great meteorite, or an ice age, has punctuated the fossil record, like chapter headings in a story. The author notes that despite development of more accurate radiocarbon dating, this area of science has held on to labels such as Jurassic, which band together tens of millions of years. Fortey maintains that the history of evolution is equally a story in which 'teleology', or evolutionary development in line with purposeful pursuit of perfection, plays a part, just as chance, like an evolutionary throw of the dice, does. The earth was born from dust from a nascent star which accumulated in a mass as it spun trapped in the thrall of the Sun. It was formerly believed that such accretion was a gradual process, but currently it is argued that such a creative event was conceived violently, with meteorites continually annealing to the chaotic mass. On especially violent impact spun off the Moon between just over 4,500-3,500 million years ago. The feverish cauterisation shuffled and recombined elements while heating up the interior of the planet. What gave life its first potential foothold on the planet was the remarkable correlation between the planet's size and temperature – a smaller planet would have burnt out, while a larger one may not have attained surface temperatures to sustain life. Another important contributing factor to the emergence of life on the planet, was the fact that it spun on its axis, thereby allowing all faces to be presented to the Sun, while the distance to the latter is not too short to absorb dangerous radiation levels. The chemical elements found in the Earth's layers are the legacy of those early meteoric impacts, the central one being carbon, a ubiquitous and indispensable ingredient of life. Carbon atoms link in chains and bind with other atoms to fashion a whole array of organic chemicals. As the Earth's solid crust developed, vents and volcanoes allowed gases to escape which created the planet's atmosphere, retained by gravity while heated and processed by the Sun's rays. What Fortey reveals is that Darwin had been extremely prescient in his suggestion that life had emerged from a 'primeval soup' with the correct balance of ingredients and transformed by heat. What is clear is that all life shares common characteristics at a molecular level. All scientists agree that the planet's original atmosphere would have been poisonous to oxygen-dependent life-forms, with less than 0.1% present of oxygen's current levels. However carbon-based elements were able to harness such poisonous ingredients for creative ends, in conjunction with other elements identified by Darwin – phosphorous and clay. Ironically, the Bible's retelling of the creation of Adam from clay may have some element of truth as its atoms are arranged in sheets between which other chemicals can concentrate and thereby react. The first life-forms were bacteria such as 'methanogens' which thrive and reproduce in intense heat, and are found near volcanic vents and at great depth in the layers of the Earth – such organisms are termed 'Archae' in scientific papers. These organisms are 'anarobes' in that their biochemistry only operate in the absence of oxygen and recent research speculates that the real cradle of life occurred around 'pyritferous seeps', places where emanations from the planet's interior seeped into the oceans. The quantity of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere built up over millennia; released as a by-product of primitive organisms', 'cyanobacteria' or 'blue-greens' which still abound under dripping taps, ponds, and arctic climes, breaking down of carbon dioxide for their own nourishment. This accumulation of oxygen eventually paved the way for development of more advanced organisms. Although the first obvious biological structure was formed of skins or mats of interweaved 'cyanobacteria', it was within such structures that more complex cells were born with a nucleus holding a genetic blueprint. The latter captured 'cyanobacteria' within their cell structure, transforming them into 'chloroplasts', found in every plant cell today, thereby enabling them to photosynthesise. As evolution progressed, these advanced cells incorporated other structures such as 'mitochondria', aiding aerobic respiration; and 'lysosomes' enabling food processing. The first animals appeared in the Pre-Cambrian era, among which were the 'Edicara Fauna' or jellyfish. Foley states that what is indisputable is that one of the greatest transformations in the history of this planet took place at the end of this era, and consisted of an episode of mass extinction. After millennia of gradual painstaking development, evolution underwent a rapid revolution in the subsequent Cambrian period with, in a shortened passage of time, the emergence of a great variety of life-forms, some accompanied by shells. Among the latter were the 'brachiopods', distant relatives of snails and clams, 'trilobites', and 'arthropods', insects and crustaceans with jointed bodies. Fortey points out that 'trilobites' were not primitive organisms, possessing nervous systems, eyes, and brains of a sort, while their shell of calcium carbonate ensured their prevalence in the fossil record. The Cambrian era witnessed the first recognisable marine ecology and the first emergence of predatory behaviour with clear hunters and hunted. The author considers how the evolutionary tree has been reinterpreted. Whereas in the past it was regarded as one which ever branched outwards, it is now equated to resembling a Christmas tree, where it is wider at the base and thins upwards. Despite the plethora of Cambrian organisms which fell foul of the 'survival of the fittest' Foley indicates that there are few which would be unrecognisable to us. Moreover, he compares the rapid changes as a virtual primeval 'arms race' in which appearance of the first predators led to species developing ever more advanced protective skeletons, which prompted further developments in an endless cycle. The manner in which life evolved was heavily dependent on the manner in which the continents drifted as a result of plate tectonics. Originally, this process was understood to have resulted from the division of a supercontinent, Pangaea, some 220 million years ago, during the Triassic era. However, modern interpretation regards Pangaea itself as resulting from earlier continental drifts reaching back to the Pre-Cambrian period. The third of the planet not containing life-forms in the Cambrian period equates to the land mass, and the colonisation of the land by plants was only possible once several obstacles were surmounted. This would reveal that there had to exist many precursors to those species which eventually succeeded. One obstacle consisted of avoiding desiccation by developing waxy coats to cut out or reduce water loss, and a subsequent necessary development was the emergence of 'stomata', which admit air but which close when the plant needs to retain water. The next major development occurred with the emergence of land animals. By the Devonian era, between 410-360 million years ago, jawed fish with backbones appeared, which were the ancestors of all land animals Just as plant species developed 'stomata, so land species developed lungs, with the appropriately named 'lungfish' developing the organ to enable them to survive periods of drought when rivers dried up. The Devonian period is so named as most of the rocks which underlie Exmoor date from this period, and it is ironic that one of this country's most peaceful counties has lent its name to one of the most revolutionary periods of this planet's history. It was only in the 1970s that 'cladistics' gained acceptance in the scientific community. This centres on the study of points at which the evolutionary tree branches out, estimating the relationships between distinct species, where each new branch coincides with the development of a new characteristic. The founding father of such studies, Willi Hennig, after initial hostility from the establishment, is now regarded akin to a secular saint. The greening of the Earth which occurred in the Devonian era became a luxurious forest of trees in the Carboniferous period, though flowers were yet to bloom in colour. During the latter period, the mergence of trees equipped with lignin and a trunk to bear the weight, and capillary action to transport water was extremely rapid. The exact dating for the evolution of the reptilian egg and the emergence of flight cannot be known for certain but it does appear that the Carboniferous period was one whose atmospheric conditions lent itself to gigantism in terms of both plants and insects. This period was unusual in that oxygen production from photosynthesis outstripped its removal, allowing for the appearance of monster arthropods. It was in this heady atmosphere that the first amniote egg, protected by a membrane, appeared, giving birth to the first reptile. What fuelled the emergence of both dinosaurs and mammals was the formation of Pangaea, with the subsequent story of terrestrial life denoted by superiority of one or the other. Yet, it would be the mass extinction at the end of the Permian era, some 250 million years ago, which would herald the appearance of most of the animal species we share the planet with today. It has been estimated that 96% of the marine species died out, including the trilobites, while the extinction of land vertebrates was less marked. The cause of this extinction remains a mystery but was probably due to a combination of climactic and geographical factors, as movement of the tectonic plates led to sweeping changes in local environments. The Cretaceous period witnessed the blossoming of flowers which developed chemical irritants as protection, which, in turn, led to evolutionary changes in insects to not only counteract such defences, but also to incorporate the same chemicals into their own means of self-defence. In tandem with such developments was that of inducements to pollination. The mystery surrounding the disappearance of the dinosaurs, was first explained as being the result of a mass extinction event by Luis Alvarez in 1980, and then by the subsequent discovery of an impact crater off the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. What is obvious is that their disappearance led to the predominance of warm-blooded mammals. In the early 1990s molecular biologists estimated the divergence between Man and his closest relative as occurring some 5 million years ago. It would be the ecological change from forest to savannah, between 4-5 million years ago, which would trigger the most important steps in human evolution. Fortey concludes with a short summary of twentieth century findings in terms of fossil records of the early ancestors of Man."

        "user_review": "Very good, very interesting. Fortey writes this book ignoring the conventions of modern popular science writing that I find so irritating and opts for a learned digression on a number of important events in the biological timeline that signify major transitions from era to era.What I love so much about books like this, where the author writes their own opinions and thoughts into the text, is that you can virtually discuss and argue the points. It's a way of permitting the reader to engage with the text meaningfully, and I think it's superior to the modern style of interview-three-experts-per-chapter-and-pretend-that-you're-a-dunce journalistic book style.Granted, you may have to already be familiar with certain lines of digression to play this game.For example, Fortey takes a shot atWonderful Lifeby Stephen Jay Gould, which it has been popular to do for some time on account of some reworking of the fossils that came out of the Burgess Shale.I personally think that Gould made a strong case for the primary thrust of his argument, which was that given the diversity of forms found in the Burgess Shale, which fulfilled the same ecological niches that exist today but in vastly different ways, it would be crazy to believe that the forms that exist today are necessarily inherently better than any number of other potential forms, and the biology we see in animals today probably has much to do with circumstance that inherent design superiority.But this point is debatable depending on how much you're willing to wave away poor environmental adaptation as being a victim of circumstance, and the degree of difference you read into the forms that have been recovered from the Burgess Shale compared to modern forms. There's a continuum of viable positions on Gould's assertion. To my mind, for all of the Burgess fossils that have been reassigned or downgraded in uniqueness, every argument that tuts Gould's enthusiasm still seems to have to grant that there are a number of oddballs that have so far yielded no obvious associations.So Fortey is of the view that the fossils in the Burgess that Gould called out have been sufficiently resituated in our understanding to call Gould's overarching argument into question. Fortey would know better than I would, I supposed, but having read Gould and having read counter-Gould, I still feel that Gould carried off the thrust of his argument. But I can see that others might fall on the other side of the line, and many of Gould's fiercest critics have been cladists, and it seems that Fortey counts himself in this camp. But not everyone is convinced the cladistics is quite as insightful as it purports to be or that the current cladograms are as accurate as the enthusiasts say they are. I think the questions in the Burgess will continue to be reconsidered until we have a greater appreciation for for how difficult certain kinds of adaptations are to make on a genetic basis, and to make in such a way that either does not decrease fitness or in fact increases fitness in a given environment. It does seem to me surprising that a rather small variety of forms persisted from a relatively greater set. If the greater diversity in the past was fundamentally not well-adapted to the environment, then how could it have arisen in the first place? We see very few mutants nowadays with such fundamental diversity in body forms who can survive and reproduce, so if the old forms weren't significant or were doomed at the outset, why were they so widespread and established at one time in the past? That's where I think Gould's argument carries the day. It seems like these other forms, which are not represented now,wereindeed well-adapted and successful, which makes it hard to understand their doom as stemming from any cause more fundamental than environmental circumstance.But it's an open question. The fact that Fortey sets out opinions like his in the book lets the reader have these mental discussions and arguments. I like that. Gould's book also was like that, which I think is part of what makes it so famous and so popular despite the contrarianism.I think this book is very much worth the read. I highly recommend it."

        "user_review": "Thirteen things that don't make senseI worried about starting this book – worried much more than I ought to have worried – but worried nonetheless. I mean, things could only be bad. Here was a book that was going to tell me about thirteen things that required a 'paradigm shift' in science. It was the number 13 that bothered me more than anything else. The world is full of morons and one of the surest ways of spotting such a moron is via numerology. Crystals are also good, well, as is homeopathy. There will be more on homeopathy later.So, I started this one through gritted teeth. And then he started off by discussing good old Thomas Kuhn – one of my least favourite philosophers. I was caught on the horns of a dilemma, either this guy was going to be some fruit-cake with a pocket full of god, or crystals, or vials for aromatherapy or he was going to be an irrationalist of the modern philosophy of science types (see Popper or Kuhn or their monster child Feyerabend) who see all science as devoid of objective reality and awaiting a great and new story-teller (such as a Newton, Einstein or Copernicus) to provide us with the next great paradigm in the endless sequence of shifts in the partial truths that scientific theories inevitably turn out to be.But this book was nothing like this – and I can only recommend it whole-heartedly. Okay, so he does go on a bit about Kuhn'sStructure of Scientific Revolutionsand is quite uncritical of the whole notion of paradigm shifts – but I guess it would be asking too much for him not to do this. Anyway, it is hard to argue that this idea does not fit nicely with his theme.Taken at the biggest picture level Kuhn's idea is that we tend to create a 'scientific orthodoxy' that determines what is worth investigating and what is beyond the bounds of legitimate scientific research. Science builds up a system of interconnecting theories and ideas and these become the landscape of the accepted. Within that landscape individual scientists in the community of science look at ways in which they can expand our knowledge of that landscape – what they don't do and what there are real disincentives for attempting (according to Kuhn) is to restructure the landscape to such an extent that we have mountains where we once had planes.However, facts are stubborn things and now and again our investigations throw up something that simply doesn't fit with accepted theories. In such cases the scientific community has one of three choices – ignore the fact (always a favourite), get it to fit into the established paradigm (tweak it) or jettison our established theories and start again (always the last choice – and a bloody good thing too!).Well, not that we ever actually do the last one, not anymore. Whatever Einstein did to Newton it wasn't starting over again. Which is my major criticism of Kuhn, but enough of that already.What are we to do if stuff we observe in the real world just doesn't fit with our theories of how the real world ought to operate? I'm not talking about supposed problems with our theories – you know, how they don't account for auras or Feng Shui – but stuff real scientists have found and can't explain.For a long time I've been an on again / off again reader ofNew Scientist. The problem is that it comes out too frequently for me to read anything other that it – so I have stopped subscribing to it. I had exactly the same problem when learning to speak Italian – learning Italian was all I could do and that was simply asking too much. Over the years I've read innumerable articles on all manner of interesting things. But one of the articles that I read years ago that fascinated me and that I never heard about again is discussed in this book – the problem with the Pioneer missions. In the 1970s we sent the only man made objects ever out of the solar system. You remember, there was that gold disk with music and photographs of people and the man and the woman waving – oh, and the fact the woman didn't have any indication that she had genitalia was to protect the project from being cancelled by the incredibly prudish I read somewhere. But I digress, for a bit of a change...When they sent these probes they decided that they might as well try to test Einstein's general theory of relativity at the same time. And why not, indeed?The problem was (and is) that the damn things aren't where they are supposed to be according to either Newton or general relativity. People have done everything to try to explain the discrepancy – thinking that there was something that had gone wrong on the probes themselves or such – but all of the theories have turned up nothing that would explain the problem. Now, when I read about this years ago in New Scientist I was quite excited by it. Not because it might explain why the Pioneer probes were slightly off course, but because it might explain that other slight inconvenience – where someone has hidden 90-odd percent of the universe. If ever we needed a paradigm shift it is in cosmology. As Oscar Wilde might have said (if given the chance) losing over 90% of the universe just looks like carelessness.But what if gravity does not work as we think it does over interstellar distances? Might that help to explain where most of the universe has gotten to while we weren't looking? I don't know enough about science to say. I generally don't buy every edition of New Scientist, not even most, but one thing that will get me to buy a copy is if there is a cover story about dark matter, dark energy or gravity. Something is seriously wrong and I'm looking forward to seeing what better minds than mine come up with to help explain it.And that is what this book is about. There are a great many things in science that simply do not make any sense at all and they are calling out for someone to make sense of them. Not by 'turning to God' or holding crystals – but by coming up with a new way to explain the world. I for one am looking forward to learning how these problems described in this book are resolved.I've only found out after reading this book that the author writes for New Scientist and based this book on an article he wrote in New Scientist called 13 Things that Don't Make Sense. These really are some of the issues that any thinking human ought to be keeping an eye on. These are the issues that every thinking human being ought to know actually are issues. A while ago I started reading a book calledI Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheistand stopped because, well, the people who wrote that book just didn't know enough about science or atheism to make any competent assessment of what they were talking about. It was a book written to counter Richard Dawkins by people who hadn't bothered to read Richard Dawkins. Those issues are done and dusted – these thirteen are the real issues facing modern humanity, not whether some boy God dressed in blue skin is the Lord of the Dance, or however that fairytale goes again.Brooks does warn that most people won't be very happy with him including Homeopathy as one of the things that don't make sense. And he is right – I'm not happy with him including Homeopathy. But then, the book wasn't written to make anyone particularly happy and I'm prepared to admit that it is possible that the final death blow is yet to be delivered to this most bizarre of alternative medicines. That said, if Homeopathy is proven to work it will be the one that will most shift our paradigms – and then some.The New Scientist article this book was based on can be found here:http://space.newscientist.com/article..."

        "user_review": "Fairly interesting account of certain anomalies in science. Dark matter, Cold Fusion and some others. A lot of what comes out here is the fact that the scientific community is as human as the rest of us. So often if findings fly in the face of \"established scientificfact\" the person making the finding or following up on the research is completely ruined.As in a researcher with a doctorate ending his days as a clerk in a stockroom or a Nobel laureate forced into retirement.I got this out of curiosity and was drawn in quickly. The statement that the statement which leads to or presage more scientific discoveries is not \"Eureka\" but \"that's funny\".The book is very readable and interesting. I suspect it will seem very elementary to any among the readers who are actually functioning researchers (Sheldon Cooper would surly make fun of it). While it does draw the reader in at times it draws it's stories out a bit much and it is possible that by the time you move from one subject to the next you'll be more than ready to do so (I was). Still enjoyable and if this is something that interests you it's a good book for the intelligent layman."

        "user_review": "In 13 Things That Don't Make Sense, Michael Brooks takes a brief look at 13 thorny problems which science has no good solution to. The problems are explained in simple terms, and include such things as death, sex, life, dark matter, and the placebo effect. What Brooks shows is that despite the best efforts of generations of scientists, and all the marvels of modern technology, we are far from understanding even such basic things as what the universe is made of and what it means to be alive.A related, and far more interesting, topic which runs through the book is the way scientists do science. Although we tend to think of science as fact or evidence based, in fact, scientists too have their preconceived ideas and prejudices to which they cling even in the face of contrary evidence. And these can be surprisingly hard to change.Brooks refers to Kuhn's idea that science changes by paradigm shifts. And he shows why often the paradigm doesn't shift until most of the adherents of the old one die off. In other words, scientists, too, suffer from the herd mentality. As proof, he cites the fact that Einstein couldn't get a job teaching physics even after publishing papers which radically altered the structure of physics. Biologists hesitate to report findings that many species of animals engage in homosexual behavior, fearing the consequences. Because of the career demolishing impact of the first report of cold fusion, most researchers now won't get anywhere near cold fusion, despite the fact that there is probably something there worth looking into. And the list goes on and on.So add to the 13 things in Brooks' book the curious timidity of many scientists to do research into or to report facts in areas which seem outlandish or contrary to conventional wisdom."

        "user_review": "I realized, before starting this book, that some of the topics might be \"old hat\". I've read about the dark matter/dark energy mystery in a number of books. But I wasn't ready for the other fascinating mysteries, that truly surprised me. For example, I thought that the placebo effect was well understood. But evidently not. For example, the common drug Valium (dizaepam) has a strong effect; but only if the person taking it understands what the effect should be. Tests have shown that the drug is no more effective than a placebo, when subjects are not told that it should reduce their anxiety levels. The FDA and the entire pharmaceutical industry relies on double-blind tests against placebos, but the author wonders if this may be a relatively meaningless test for some types of medicines.Other questions also surprised me. Why do organisms die? Still unknown. Is there life on Mars? The experts have waffled on this question, as the equipment/sensors on board the Viking spacecraft have been shown to be orders of magnitude less sensitive than originally thought. Why has sexual reproduction evolved through natural selection? Also not understood. Is there such a thing as free will? Recent experiments have shown that our actions are not as self-induced as one might think. I thought that cold fusion was dead; but apparently not--research has been stymied by the career-breaking consequences that it has had on reputable scientists."

        "user_review": "Consistently mind-blowing - until about the halfway point, where the focus shifts from the cosmic to the prosaic. Now granted, I'm a scientific ignoramus, but I can't be alone in feeling that cosmology is just way sexier than biology, so to go from heady speculations about a multiplicity of universes to - of all sublunary things - the wonders of homeopathy -- well, it kind of killed my buzz.Highly recommended, in any case, especially for those who, like me, are impatient with the nuts and bolts of science but take a dilletantish interest in the big questions.Oh - and here's a fun little tidbit I picked up from Brooks. It turns out that when Einstein made his famous remark about God's not playing dice with the universe, Niels Bohr was there to deliver a brilliant slapdown. 'Einstein,' he said, 'Stop telling God what to do.' How did I not know this? Over the years, I could have confounded a lot of physics geeks (and Jesus freaks) with that one."

        "user_review": "I really enjoyed this book. In a world where most geographical frontiers have already been explored it's inspiring to read about the wild west of science where our knowledge is small and great discoveries are still to be made.The author did a good job of interweaving the 13 things so the book felt like a single work and not 13 distinct essays. There are interesting humans elements to the book. It's fascinating how the careers of so many scientists were affected by their 'discoveries.' The final chapter on homeopathy, the one I almost skipped because the topic seemed like an open-and-shut case, surprisingly turned out to be the most interesting. I also really enjoyed the discussion on dark matter and the way that single topic was interwoven throughout the book."

        "user_review": "Some of these things are sort of covered in Brooks' other book, At the Edge of Uncertainty, while others weren't. There's a bunch of interesting stuff about extraterrestrial intelligence and the experiments looking for microbial life on Mars, for instance. As with the other book, Brooks gives clear explanations. In fact, reading both books illuminated more about the topics that were in both. Each topic leads to the next in a very logical way, too.The topic selections are all interesting: life on Mars, the 'wow' signal, discrepancies about universal constants… It may not all be of interest to every reader, but it's a good selection of scientific mysteries and frontiers. It explores them quite well, without going into too much detail.Very much a pop science book, suitable for readers of New Scientist and similar publications. Which isn't surprising, since he was an editor for that magazine!Originally posted here."

Most people put two socks into the wash, there surely can't be many who sniff their socks and decide that one of them could go another day. So what happens then?

I checked out some reviews here at GR and found that it goes from the cosmos to the human, so I started reading it backwards, going t'other way about, and virtually giving up when I got past sex and death. I'm sure that Mr Brooks is very competent at explaining physics stuff to science-challenged people like me, but I just couldn't summon the concentration when there is so much that I should be reading for school, for work, to justify my subscription to Die Zeit. It's all quite fascinating, but worryingly inconclusive. That is the message: there's still lots we don't know, but I for one certainly don't want to hear that there might actually be something in the quackery that is called homeopathy. I mean that friend of mine whose son had a stiff neck, and dashed off to the homeopath for 'globuli'. They were sold to her at some inflated price with the wonderfully cynical advice \"If he doesn't feel better after five days, then come back\" FIVE DAYS??? A stiff neck will go away by itself within three days, so these 'globuli' must have been SLOWING THE PROCESS DOWN!!! And here I read that there is a chance that the structure of water might be in some way significant. Ammunition for the quacks. Tsk tsk."

But it does sum up how one can walk away feeling after reading this book. It's a feeling that I've long contended with the more I read and learn about sciences, particularly astronomy. Several classes and many books on the subject later and there is still so much supposition and guesswork and uncertainty. Virtually 96 percent of cosmos is comprised of dark matter and dark energy (of which everyone's pretty much in the dark about), what we know is infinitesimal, what we don't is daunting. And that's only one of the subjects. Brooks in this book highlights some of the things we don't know and/or that don't really makes sense. At least as of yet, until the paradigm shift enters into it. So it's a humbling kind of a reading experience, but it's interesting enough in a reader's digest sort of way, it provides some good basic information for those who are not familiar with the subjects and a nice refresher for those who are. It's fairly educational, concise and written in an easy to process manner. While personally I prefer nonfiction written with more personality and a humorous approach if possible, Brooks' MO is a more serious, personality free (until the epilogue) approach, but it still made for a pretty good read about our ineffable mysterious world. Sense shall be made."

Is this bit of knowledge reached by consensus or established by conformity (or worse yet, complacence)? What other approaches are there to it? What facts do not fit the picture? How do we adjust our goggles?(That last one reminds me of a saying I first saw inThe Broken Godby David Zindell:Beliefs are the eyelids of the mind.)More ruminations to follow.11 Nov 2021:The passage of time has carried away most ruminations I used to have.

        "user_review": "This is, all in all, pretty weak. There are certainly some interesting things raised in the book - good summaries of some of the alternative theories raised to explain things like the prevalence of dark matter, and so on. At the same time, science has moved on a fair bit since the book was written. The Pioneer Anomaly, for example, has been explained, to the apparent satisfaction of scientists. The experiments supposedly debunking free will have, possibly, been shown to be deeply problematic and perhaps not saying what they were thought to have said. (Although, as a hard determinist and philosophy-hater, I don't think that the concept of free will is actually in any way meaningful, at least how it's usually expressed.)Now, perhaps it's a bit unfair to criticise a book for stuff which has only come to light in the past few years. However, the fact that these things have gotten simple explanations - the roots of which have been around for a while - means it at least needs to be raised. I wouldn't be so churlish as to mark down the book for it, however.The real problem, I think, is Brooks' willingness to accept odd fringe theories as having equal validity as established ones. Yes, Kuhn, renegade scientists, paradigm shifts, blah blah blah. It is quite obvious that the standard theories do not adequately explain the universe, at least in quite the way we want. But that doesn't mean that the fringe stuff is right. After all, Newtonian physics are still, as a basic approximation, valid for most things, even after the development of Einsteinian physics into the standard model.And then there's the ludicrous stuff. Cold fusion gets a remarkably sympathetic treatment - we are led to believe that there's something important there, because the US military have invested money in it. Presumably we're meant to ignore their distance viewing experiments, and MKUltra, and whatever else. The military has lots of money, it can afford to throw cash at the fringes just in case that might be advantageous. The explanations for cold fusion which propose experimental errors or odd conditions (such that it might be a function of the palladium samples used, for example) are far more convincing, but they are, if not dismissed, certainly tainted by implication.And then there's homeopathy. Seriously, by now surely we've realised that it's probably best explained by a combination of placebo, regression to the mean, a good bedside manner, and perhaps a few other things? I mean, it's not like every study ever hasn't confirmed this. But no, Brooks is talking about the structural memory of water and BLAH BLAH THIS IS STUPID.No."

        "user_review": "The purpose of this book is to show, by 13 different examples, how science has a long way to go before it can assure us that \"all is under control\". Somehow, we are aware of this limitation. I am still unsure of the writer's stance. Is he in favor of science? He explains one set of difficulties scientists faced in a certain area of research, before moving on to another. There are interesting bits of information peppered in, which is all this book has to offer in my opinion, so that you can sound a little smarter if a related conversation sparks up among your friends.This is not a science book with a vision to theorize or bring under an umbrella varied separated notions of reality. It has no such scientific goal as such. Neither it aims to illuminate with great clarity the complex theories of science for the laymen (the way books by Feynman or say Brain Greene are written). What I mean is, if you have read a great deal of pop-science, then you already know most of what is discussed here. Because this book is what its title suggests, and if that's what you look for, it will work for you. I particularly enjoyed the sections on Dark Matter and Free Will."

        "user_review": "13 Things That Don't Make Sense: The Most Baffling Scientific Mysteries of Our Time by Michael Brooks\"13 Things That Don't Make Sense\" is a provocative look at 13 scientific wide-ranging mysteries. Michael Brooks holds a PhD in Quantum Physics, editor and now consultant for New Scientist magazine, takes the reader on the wonderful journey of scientific mysteries. Since the publishing of this book a few of these mysteries have been resolved. This provocative 256-page book includes the following thirteen mysteries/chapters: 1. The Missing Universe, 2. The Pioneer Anomaly, 3. Varying Constants, 4. Cold Fusion, 5. Life, 6. Viking, 7. The Wow! Signal, 8. A Giant Virus, 9. Death, 10. Sex, 11. Free Will, 12. The Placebo Effect, and 13. Homeopathy.Positives:1.\tA well-written, well-researched and entertaining book.2.\tThe writing is fair and even-handed almost too much so.3.\tThe fascinating topic of scientific mysteries in the capable hands of Dr. Brooks. \"The future of science depends on identifying the things that don't make sense; our attempts to explain anomalies are exactly what drives science forward.\"4.\tExcellent format! Each chapter is about a specific scientific mystery and the author cleverly leads the end of the previous chapter into the next one.5.\tInteresting facts spruced throughout the book. \"Color is our way of interpreting the frequency of—that is, the number of waves per second in—radiation. When we see a rainbow, what we see is radiation of varying frequencies. The violet light is a relatively high-frequency radiation, the red is a lower frequency; everything else is somewhere in between.\"6.\tProfound and practical practices in science. \"They won't embrace the extraordinary until they rule out the ordinary.\"7.\tProvocative questions that drive the narrative. \"Have the laws of physics remained the same for all time?\"8.\tAn interesting look at cold fusion. \"To get energy out of atoms, you either have to break up their cores—a process called nuclear fission—or join different atoms together by nuclear fusion.\"9.\tOne of the deepest concepts, the concept of what constitutes life. \"If creating life is \"simply\" a matter of putting the right chemicals together under the right conditions, there's still no consensus about what \"right\" actually is—for the chemicals or the conditions.\"10.\tIt never hurts to quote some of the greatest thinkers, consider the late great Carl Sagan, \"We live on a hunk of rock and metal that circles a humdrum star that is one of 400 billion other stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy which is one of billions of other galaxies which make up a universe which may be one of a very large number, perhaps an infinite number, of other universes. That is a perspective on human life and our culture that is well worth pondering.\"11.\tIs there life on Mars? Find out about some of the attempts made. \"One of the strongest arguments against life existing on Mars has always been the harshness of the environment: low temperatures, a wispy thin atmosphere, and the lack of liquid water all count against the development of living organisms.\"12.\tA look at Occam's razor applied to aliens. \"Occam's razor, and it says that, given a number of options, you should always go for the simplest, most straightforward one.\"13.\tA fascinating look at the Giant Virus. \"There were the eukaryotes, the advanced organisms like animals and plants whose large and complex cells contained a nucleus that held inheritable information. The other branch was the simpler prokaryotes, such as bacteria, which have cells without a nucleus.\"14.\tA look at death. \"Over the years, though, evidence mounted up supporting Kirkwood's idea that aging is due to a slow, steady buildup of defects in our cells and organs.\"15.\tWhy the need for sex? \"In general, the random genetic drift due to chance variation offers the best hope of explaining the apparent advantage of sex.\"16.\tHomosexuality in the animal kingdom. \"Bruce Bagemihl's ten-year labor of love, Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity, reports that more than 450 species have been documented engaging in nonprocreative sexual behavior—including long-term pairings.\"17.\tA fascinating look at free will. \"The lesson we learn from all this is that our minds do not exist separately from the physical material of our bodies. Though it is a scary and entirely unwelcome observation, we are brain-machines. We do not have what we think of as free will.\" \"In the illusion of free will, it seems we have been equipped with a neurological sleight of hand that, while contrarational, helps us deal with a complex social and physical environment.\"18.\tSo what about the placebo effect? \"The general conclusion here, it seems, is that the placebo effect is due to chemistry.\"19.\tWhy is homeopathy still in existence? \"According to the World Health Organization, it now forms an integral part of the national health-care systems of a huge swath of countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.\" \"An assessment of homeopathy using the criteria of known scientific phenomena says it simply cannot work; no wonder Sir John Forbes, the physician to Queen Victoria's household, called it \"an outrage to human reason.\"20.\tNotes and sources provided.Negatives:1.\tSince the book was released in 2008 some of the anomalies have been resolved if not really not taken seriously. As an example, the Pioneer Anomaly was resolved; feel free to look it up.2.\tI felt Dr. Brooks was a little too generous toward the wrong side of scientific consensus. As example, the discarded homeopathy.3.\tLack of charts and diagrams that would have complemented the sound narrative.4.\tThough immersed to various degrees here and there I would have liked to see Dr. Brooks be clearer on what the scientific consensus is for each chapter.In summary, I really liked this book. The book holds up quite well despite being released in 2008. My only gripe is not making perfectly clear what the scientific consensus is for each mystery, also, I would have discarded homeopathy as a scientific mystery. That said, a fun book to read, I recommend it!Further suggestions: \"At the Edge of Uncertainty\" by the same author, \"The Big Picture\" by Sean Carroll, \"Now: The Physics of Time\" by Richard A. Muller, \"13:8: The Quest to Find the True Age of the Universe and the Theory of Everything\" by John Gribbin, \"Know This: Today's Most Interesting and Important Scientific Ideas, Discoveries, and Developments\" by John Brockman\" and \"The Island of Knowledge\" by Marcelo Gleiser."

Да си призная, аз такива изказвания съм чувал само от: а) пълни невежи; б) преподаватели по физика на частиците в Принстън.... Да, и аз бях O.o във втория случай. Но мисля, че на човека вече му мина. Даже не се наложи да му дам да чете предговора на тази книга. ;)Загадките, които ме изумиха най-много мен, бяха:- Глава 10: За какво в крайна сметка служи сексът? При условие че сума ти видове сума ти години се оправят и без него? (А някои видове стават ту полови, ту безполови за дълги периоди от време, в зависимост от околната среда.)Същата глава съдържа и някои статистики за хомосексуалността при животните, от които може да проревете. Само моля да ревете по-шумно, за да ви чуя и да се посмеем. Заедно. :)- Глава 9: Кое ни кара да умираме? Колко неподозирани проблеми – включително нелечими болести – се крият в онази част от гените ни, която почва да се проявява, щом минем стотака? Ще кажем ли \"бай-бай\" на мечтите си за дълговечие?Тук пък за първи път се сблъсках с понятието \"биологично безсмъртие\".В Човешката библиотека качих и няколко откъса, които подбирахме за евентуалната анотация на книгата:https://choveshkata.net/forum/viewtop..."

        "user_review": "A while ago, I read an article on Yahoo (Almost always a bad idea, but it happened nevertheless) about a scientist who claimed that we were an inch away from completely disproving god from a purely objective standpoint. I was unimpressed with the article, but I found the comments on the article to be great reading.Namely because the article was universally reviled by atheists and agnostics as much as the religious. Though they did not believe in god, they claimed that our grasp of the universe was too narrow to objectively disprove any possibility of a god. (Note: It is not my intention to argue for or against the existence of a god. Please do not assume that it is) It speaks entire volumes that Richard Dawkins and Carl Sagan consider (and in the case of Sagan, considered) themselves agnostics because they did not have any clinching proof. The same way that is speaks leagues of that scientist's arrogance in assuming that humanity had the definitive answer to one of the most persistent and controversial questions in human history when there are so many simpler mysteries that we have yet to solve.The more educated one is, the more one realizes how little we actually know. To say that science has all the answers is a ludicrous claim and one that is, quite frankly, egotistic. But to claim that we will never understand the universe is just lazy. The human race may not ever completely understand everything in the universe, but even if we don't we'll die trying, damn it!That is why this book, 13 Thing that Don't Make Sense, is a success and is something that I, personally, recommend: because it rides the fine line between humility at our knowledge of the universe and a love for the search of truth. Michael Brooks is not content to simply say that something is unexplained and foreign to our current knowledge. He does not simply stare into the darkness but probes it, offering light where he can and always maintaining an enthusiasm for the progression of science as opposed to stagnant appreciation for what we've already learned. A large part of the book is spent examining not just the anomalies themselves but also the people who uncovered and attempted to solve them, and revealed facts that I found shocking.To me, the notion that scientists' reputation are ruined by some faulty experiment or association with a faulty idea is repulsive. That the scientific community, which is defined entirely by keeping an open (though skeptical) mind outright scorns the people who propose a new, reasonably logical, idea is a great injustice to science itself (scorning an idea is not the same thing. Scorning an idea that has been proven false is a key part of science. Scorning a legitimate scientist who proposed a faulty idea should not be). To err is human. We're allowed to make mistakes. Certainly a scientist who refuses to see his or her mistakes has no place in science, but making an error is not such a crime. Nor is testing a phenomenon that is generally not accepted to see if there is some kind of truth behind it.13 Thing That Don't Make Sense is a book that epitomizes, at least to me, what it means to be a scientist. Always searching, always looking for new answers to problems that vex us. I recommend this to anyone who desires to go into science and anyone who wants to learn a little more about our universe in general.P.S. I would appreciate feedback or corrections. Perhaps I made mistakes in the review. Perhaps some of my observations are incorrect. Either way, I'm trying to improve and it would be most helpful if any of you could help out."

        "user_review": "This book offered a fascinating glimpse into the world of science – with all of its successes and still all of its lingering mysteries. It is engaging, well-written, and leaves you above all else – thinking! The author however makes two mistakes (hence one less star): one grave, and the other… More grave.Early in the book, the author explains how science is not about people, it's about nature. This is a likely conclusion from someone ingrained in physics, which is what the book is mostly about. The truth is that ALL of science – physics and psychology and geography and chemistry – is about people, because it's people -- with all of their bias and all of their backgrounds and experiences -- who formed those theories. It may be the case that across the universe, some alien world has also derived the idea that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared; but this isn't inevitable, not like discovering the property that 2+3 = 5. Science certainly does not have to study people, as physics doesn't; but science is about people, formed by people, tested by people, embraced by people – in short, WE are science.But the second more grave error is more fundamental, by taking on a topic like free will that does not belong to the playground of science – this is philosophy's baby (grandfathered by religion), and the very idea that science will take this on and arrive at a conclusion to either accept or dismiss it is almost perverse; like practicing philosophy without a license! It truly is irrelevant that we can identify the brain mechanism that results in a finger twitch, and then conclude that we can circumvent your free will by activating that circuit. This is akin to our eye blink response, largely under the control of the autonomic nervous system which regularly regulates this for you – – but you can override the system, if you so CHOOSE. The author also may be confusing free will with thoughts or actions outside of awareness, as showing that the brain mechanisms are at work well before one's decision or intention toward a particular goal -- a related question, and perhaps more deserving of science's consideration.BOTTOM LINE: read this book! Every consumer of science needs to realize we have come a long way and discovered some amazing things but we are far from done. However, as any good citizen we have to be a watchdog for science too, and not let the tail wag the dog..."

I enjoy that, it is defiantly on my track of thinking. He took on a number of controversial topics and some of them (homeopathy for example) I don't think I will ever agree with given the current state of affairs but the author doesn't really ask you to agree with anything. He just says there are things that don't make sense and that is it. I am ok with that. He didn't seem to have any hidden agendas so the rest I can let pass as just interesting brain candy. I like thinking about different things and I am not the type to want to get so caught up in what \"is\" that I can't postulate other scenarios. I would never have homeopathy as a remedy on my list though nor would I recommend it for family or friends. That aside, (also the space probe thing was missing a few well known refutes). Anyway as long as their is no view pushing I can swallow it. It was still a fun read."

        "user_review": "Michael Brooks' survey of anomalies in contemporary science (2009 - UK Edition) might be regarded as a riposte to the 'end of science' thesis promoted by John Horgan in the mid-1990s. He makes a very good case although one has the suspicion that it is not that there is nothing else to know (which this book shows would be an absurd proposition) but perhaps that there are things that, because of the limitations of ourselves as human observers, we may never know.Brooks adopts a systematic approach, taking us from anomalies in cosmology and physics through those in biology thence to evolutionary studies, neuroscience and medicine. However, it might be better here to separate out the one-off nagging anomalies, which may or may not be important. They may, of course, be of considerable importance IF proven but the broader sets of anomaly that frustrate scientists in their fields and indicate the potential (no more) for a major 'Kuhnian' paradigm shift, equivalent to that from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican astronomical system, are much more interesting. Such paradigm shifts can have significant associated cultural and political effects whereas the one-off anomalies have (largely) yet to be settled even as anomalies and imply rather than state major paradigm change.Let's dispose quickly of these 'one-offs' - cold fusion, a navigational anomaly with the Pioneer spacecraft, disputed evidence for life on Mars and the freak alleged 'ET' signal received in 1977. These are fascinating but inconclusive. We are just going to have to admit that, as of today, we don't know whether cold fusion is possible, whether there is life on Mars or there are signalling aliens - not until more experiments can be mounted (at considerable public cost), possibly not even then.The anomalies that imply paradigm shifts fall into two general areas - the nature of physics and of the universe and the nature of life and of matters affecting the relationship of mind and body. Perhaps the anomalies in the first zone (which relate to serious problems with the current consensus derived from Einstein's revision of Newtonian mechanics) might impact on the latter, but, at this point in history, such a leap would be so speculative as to be scientifically meaningless.This book is mostly an easy read by a science journalist and consultant with considerable skill in explaining complex matters to the lay reader but, be warned, you will have to keep your wits about you. The general reader is going to have to take many claims for granted. Nevertheless, he feels reliable and the only 'wobbly' section is that on free will which we will come to in a moment.The cosmology and physics anomalies are interesting but hard to make relevant to daily life. Our model of the universe works near to us but does not quite stack up the further that you move away from our immediate locality - issues of dark energy, dark matter, possible unknown gravitational forces and 'varying constants' suggest that some of the finest mathematical minds and some significant astronomical resources are going to be puzzling away at these issues for a good time to come.What may be more relevant to us as persons on this planet is the complex of debates surrounding some very basic questions about human existence that have hitherto been left to philosophers but into which scientists are now intruding:* what exactly is life? - to which there still appears to be no clear answer* what is the role of the virus in evolution?* why death? and why sexual rather than asexual repoduction?* whether we have free will?* and how the placebo effect and homeopathy work (or don't work) in medicine?Brooks is effective in outlining, without (except in one case - free will) prejudice, the contrasting scientific theories and the inconclusive evidence in each case and he is not shy of making a subsidiary point of considerable importance about the flaws in scientists rather than in scientific method.Scientists themselves are not objective machines but are human beings dependent on their own perception, expectations (both group and their own) and prejudices and (my opinion and not his) on measurement and analytical tools created by humans for humans. Even peer review can be unreliable, although the track record of scientific method in uncovering reliable facts remains, on balance, a good and effective one - if a lot more long-winded and cumbersome (and so expensive) than some lay people think.Towards the end of the book, Brooks get a little less sure-footed. His account of the free will debate is not very convincing. In this area, many scientists are missing the point about free will and the human condition - or rather about the impossibility of measuring 'intent in the field'. One might concede that, for most of the time and in most conditions (especially under conditions of both stability or extreme emergency), the human mind is much more on auto-pilot than we like to think. Free will is possibly meaningless insofar as actions undertaken on auto-pilot involve a suspension of will and a body and mind losing themselves to cause and effect. It is this phenomenon that the scientists are clearly recording.However, it is an unscientific and dangerous assumption to believe that a mind is not capable of setting the autopilot in the first place or of taking charge and making decisions, including positive decisions to reconform the mind to meet internal needs. Whether this proposition is true or false, it is also untestable for all the reasons noted by the philosopher Heidegger and others that each instant of consciousness is unique for each person - no instant can be held down and quantified without the fact of it being studied becoming part of the equation. Once observed in ways that meet the needs of scientific method, the 'will' may well disappear in the very decision to concede to the process. The answer to the riddle may be that the binary absolute of free will/determinism is absurd in itself - much of the time we are on autopilot but we have developed a consciousness capable of exerting will which most do not use very often but some do. The quality of free will is its uniqueness. Scientific method is not good with highly contingent or random effects and consciousness deals in complexity, the contingent and the randomness of external inputs.The danger here (given that the case is not proven either way) is that experimental evidence will create, much as early Darwinism did, an inappropriate model of human behaviour that might meet the paradigm of what can be observed but cannot embrace what cannot be observed (a similar problem to that of cosmology). A sufficient to academic or commercial purpose 'working model' of the mind, based on autopilot behaviour, might become integrated into cultural and political policy and so into social and economic regulation - the path to a state- or community-directed 'soft' tyranny. History has a precedent - the use of evolutionary studies in Rassenpolitik in the first half of the last century.We might see new attempts at social control which seem scientifically appropriate but which become massive perversions of the human condition as they are integrated into ideological presuppositions about human nature. However, before being too harsh on the neuro-scientists' potential political naivete, the research has one good side benefit - the destruction, even amongst scientists themselves, of any pretensions by humanity to ultra-rationalism or objectivity. The book could be seen as a running commentary on the lack of full rationalism in scientific treatment of anomalies but the point is a much bigger one and raised by Brooks himself - rational decision-making is an illusion. However, this does not tell the whole story.Decision-making is not rational by any external standard (such as that of scientific positivism) but it is perfectly rational from the point of view of the organism itself (which fact irritates many rationalists). It is just that an outsider does not understand the base assumptions of the person making the decision - what appears irrational to an outsider is not to the insider. The issue then comes down to assessing why particular individuals have a 'will' to accept 'incorrect' assessments of their environment (from the point of socially constructed reality) that lead to (apparently) irrational responses and why this may have survival benefits (or not). For example, if you are a victim of external power but cannot change things for the better, a decision to take up magic or religion might be a rational act (a sort of social placebo effect amongst other things) in order to avoid despair, to aid survival and to build community cohesion that offers survival advantages.This apparent irrationality is perfectly rational and may even be 'willed' - Sartre's famous case of the waiter who 'becomes' a waiter rather than a person is the type of all strategies of survival through inauthenticity. But it does not mean that persons are not capable of being authentic. It may also mean that neuroscientists are only investigating inauthenticity - some subjects decide not to be investigated and these may be the very persons who need to be investigated to make any progress in understanding free will (say). Scientists, indeed all rationalists, have had real difficulty understanding these practical points of living in the world. It is good to see psychologists and neuroscientists beginning a journey towards understanding the counter-productiveness of pure 'objective' rationality even if (unlike us 'existentialists') they still have a way to go yet and may blunder into politics along the way.Very different problems arise with the placebo effect (where 'not-knowing' is part of the effect) and with homeopathy. In both cases, there seem to be real effects. Yet the difficulty of proving or disproving these effects divides scientists into sceptics and those who are more open-minded in debates that can get increasingly bitter. One solution for some scientists in understanding the first effect is to allow doctors to turn into shamans and keep patients in the dark for their own good. Another in relation to homeopathy is to postulate that water has structural qualities that permit the phenomenon and that, one day, homeopathy might indeed be 'tamed' and introduced back into allopathic (conventional) medicine. The common denominators here (sociologically) are the desire of the 'expert' positivist-minded scientific community to accrue power to itself and to systematise any effects into what is acceptable on positivists' own terms.However, just as with the problem of free will, it may be that science is reaching the limit of its ability to know and is seeking to create boundaries beyond which there can be only 'magic' (with magic's negative connotations). In fact, true scientists (and there are many magnificent examples in this book) remain open-minded about all anomalies at all times and remain determined to push scientific method to its limits. They know what they do not know.It may be that the human mind will not be able to know or grasp the true nature of the universe for a number of technical perceptual and measurement reasons and that the modelling will have to move from science to art - or rather to the art of increasingly sophisticated but ultimately untestable mathematical modelling that may pull cosmology back to the domain of belief i.e. belief in the most cogent mathematical model where the components may not be tested, in fact, against real conditions in the world. At this level, science really does revert to religion but the religion of the 'most reasonable belief in the circumstances', certainly not as experimentally verified truth.A similar process may be happening at the 'mind' level too but under conditions which may be more dangerous for human social development and survival. Experimentally, it is impossible to know all actions or thoughts or all responses and feelings within a conscious human community but neuroscience and medecine may try to do precisely this - creating 'laws' that enter into consciousness and become self-fulfilling as socially constructed reality rather than as true representations of what is the case.This is important. A physical or cosmological law does not (unless you believe in magic) change the conditions of the universe through enunciation but a psychological or social 'law' changes the conditions of society when people with power decide to take it on and impose it throughout a culture. The power of 'incantation' is understood in the context of the placebo effect and probably applies to many more social conditions than health provision. Social Darwinism came to include racist nonsense but its acceptance by elites resulted in the masses adopting and believing in racial science as if it were true and many (though not all by any means) then became racists with conceptions of inferiority and superiority that may have been technologically true but were biologically idiotic (regardless of morality).Given that scientists do not KNOW how either the placebo effect or homeopathy works (or otherwise), they should continue to work in good faith and with a bit of humility to establish the mechanisms (whether psychological or physical) for the phenomena but they should not allow politicians and bureaucrats to purloin these studies at the expense of human freedom - nor state as law that something is not so when persons clearly experience it as so. Though Brooks would undoubtedly not agree (given his status within the scientific community as one of its interpreters), it might be argued that, just as free will can never be known not to not exist in a human community amounting to several billion, so the public has a right not to trust scientists absolutely and to demand the right to homeopathic treatment even if it should be 'proved' to be wholly placebo in effect. If it works, don't knock it!Similarly, if a placebo works in many cases, as it clearly does in pain relief, then this fact should permit the public to accept guidance from people who are not in white coats but can also provide relief and comfort - even real shamans if necessary. What Brooks points out is the real danger that over-enthusiasm for placebo effects will result in a drift away from rational medicine to quackery that causes real damage to persons with severe and very real organic illnesses. He is absolutely right and the way forward is probably an easy tolerance of the self-healing within the mind (thanks to a bit of TLC) in order to ensure that patients continue to get checked up and take white coat advice where it matters. Whether free will, placebo or homeopathy, the men in white coats should continue to investigate and theorise but should not deny phenomena too eagerly from what amounts to ideological distaste or class self-interest.Where we may get to is a bad scenario or a good scenario. The bad scenario is where the new consensus is that we do not know our own minds and others must take care of us, perhaps by lying (placebo effect) or by controlling and limiting grey area therapies through massive regulation and integration into the mainstream. This is where some would have us go and I suggest that this derives from a personality type that is attracted into bureaucracy and politics.The second scenario is the good one. It allows persons to make choices as if they had free will all things being equal (even if some neuroscientists might argue against it), is open and transparent about techniques (including the dangerous new zone of neuro-marketing and political 'nudge') and allows, where not harmful, the public to find their own structures of coping that make may use of science and belief, even what positivists might dismiss as magic. In the meantime, if society wants rational behaviour, it can do its part by creating a society of equals with access to full information, power over their environment and sufficient resources.This review has gone off at a tangent because the book does not raise these questions directly itself. It stops at the science and avoids philosophy - and certainly politics. Whether we understand or do not understand the nature of the universe is unlikely to affect us directly (unless resolution of anomalies such as cold fusion or new particles gives us new energy sources or weapons of war) but any scientific theory about our minds has enormous import for the turn of our culture and our society.This book is worth reading if you are scientifically curious but it is also worth reading if you like to think of yourself as an educated citizen. You will learn two big things amongst the many small things - that science is far more complex than the establishment of simple truths (a fact worth bearing in mind in accepting any standard view of climate change) and that important work is going on now on anomalies related to consciousness that we, as free individuals, must get a grip on lest others with power take them up and adapt them to purposes that end our freedoms with cataclysmic speed. Educate yourself or others will educate you to their requirements.[For an associated comment, making use of the cold fusion case study in the book -http://asithappens.tppr.info/journal/...]"

        "user_review": "Nine Things That Don't Make Sense Plus Four Boring Things. Just Skip Those.When I read the title, I was expecting a discussion on things like: Why, after 200,000 years of evolution, our politicians are getting more stupid? Why do globes have the North Pole up the top? Why can't Australia be the Land Up Above? Who decided that light should travel at 186,000 mps? Why is gravity the strength it is? Why can't I read faster than my sister? No. This is way more esoteric than that. That doesn't mean the book is all boring - just some bits. Brooks has explained things in a manner that you don't have to be a Sheldon Cooper to understand them. It's just that most people will find at least one chapter (or more) boring. Even so, I learned a hell of a lot from this book. You might too. Have your Wikipedia handy.So here we have a bunch of cosmologists, astronomers and physicists all sitting on the discoveries of Newton, Einstein etc, and all looking smugly at each other as they think they've figured out the meaning of life, the universe and everything, only to discover to their horror - they haven't! Why are those damn galaxies we see in our telescopes not behaving like we told them to? Hmm. Must be dark matter, or maybe Darth Vader. Nope. Maybe gravity isn't what we thought. Hrrumph! (How do we tell everyone - we don't know?) As it turns out, all those universal constants aren't as constant as we thought.Has SETI actually heard from aliens? And who really cares? It's not like they're going to come a-knocking wanting to sell us their new-and-improved alien Tupperware any time soon.The placebo effect? More common than you might think. And more effective too.Homeopathy? Well I'm an evidence-based science man myself, but Brooks, to his credit, takes a very open-minded position on this.In chapter 3, I detected a mild anti-Australian sentiment, but I guess us \"Colonials\" aren't known for our astrophysics prowess. Apparently we should stick to wrastlin' kangaroos and avoiding dangerous drop bears.There's no doubt, Brooks has done a truck load of research. 15% of the book is dedicated to telling us that. His writing style is easy to read, but I did find my eyes glazing over occasionally. On the whole though - a pretty unbiased work, and dare I say, interesting."

        "user_review": "A decent overview of some the unsolved questions that modern science is currently puzzling over (how to explain all the \"missing\" matter in the universe) or lacks the data to answer conclusively any time soon (is there life on other planets? do we really have free will?). Then there are a few chapters concerning what might be described as fringe science (e.g. cold fusion, the placebo effect, homeopathic medicine). While I appreciate the spirit of inquiry, I suspect that homeopathic medicine is probably not one of the great mysteries occupying scientific minds today.Unfortunately, the author's style is a bit fragmentary -- he drops a lot of names and technical information, but doesn't make the core controversies quite as clear as they could be, or provide the satisfying overview one might get from a book focused solely on astrophysics, space exploration, or biology. Regarding the \"fringe science\", the author's discussion of the side making the incredible claim is extremely lightweight. Sure, maybe the cold fusion people are somehow right, and the mainstream scientific community will be proven wrong, but this writer has elucidated anything compelling about that particular mystery, if it even is a mystery, for me.Still, the book expressed an interesting theme: the scientific community has always had trouble accepting anomalous data that suggests that current theories on something might be flawed -- those who have staked their careers on an existing model aren't eager to see it overturned, and those who might try to explain the data using a new framework must put their own reputations on the line. Thus, it takes a while for \"hey, the galaxy isn't expanding the way Einstein's theory predicts\" to become an issue scientists are willing to talk about. For this somewhat disquieting revelation and the fact it'll probably whet your appetite for other science reading, this book's certainly worth a library check-out."

        "user_review": "\"Under torture you are as if under the dominion of those grasses that produce visions. Everything you have heard told, everything you have read returns to your mind, as if you were being transported, not toward heaven, but toward hell. Under torture you say not only what the inquisitor wants, but also what you imagine might please him, because a bond (this, truly, diabolical) is established between you and him ... These things I know, Ubertino; I also have belonged to those groups of men who believe they can produce the truth with white-hot iron. Well, let me tell you, the white heat of truth comes from another flame.\"― Umberto Eco, The Name of the RoseThe Bavarian town of Schongau already has a multitude of problems: an ongoing trade war with the Augsburgers, a fiery controversy over building a leper house, and the ever present fears of plague and witchcraft. It is 1659, but just seventy years previously over 60 women were burned at the stake for witchcraft. When a young boy is pulled from the river who had been bludgeoned to death, and bears the mark of witchcraft on his back, the superstitious fears explode into full throated cries for immediate pitchfork and torch vengeance.The easy target is the local midwife, Martha Stechlin, who not only has birthed most of the towns children, taking money away from local doctors in the process, but she has also has offered cures for coughs, rashes, and pains with mystifyingly good results. Like most witch hunts that I've read about the women who are accused are usually those women who are under suspicion for reasons more to do with petty jealousy, revenge, or the fact that the women have accumulated knowledge of the medical arts that generally supersede the knowledge of the local trained medical profession.They are dangerous women because they have...power.An unlikely man stands between Martha Stechlin and death by mob, the hangman Jakob Kuisl. He comes from a long line of ancestors who all provided this specialized skill for the state. Besides executions, as part of his service to the community, he also tortures, removes dead animals, provides treatment for various ailments, and in the case of this story he also, with the help of a calming smoking pipe filled with this wonderful intoxicating weed from the New World, investigates the circumstances surrounding this accusation of witchcraft.As more children show up dead bearing the same marks of witchcraft on their back, and with numerous sightings of a man with a skeletal hand that could only be the devil, Jakob finds himself in a desperate race to find out who is really behind the death of the children before he has to break Martha under torture. To gain time he gave Martha a potion that relieves some of the pain from the thumbscrews.He keeps assuring her not to not give up and confess to something he knows she hasn't done. Unfortunately, even though Jakob of the 17th century knows that anyone can be made to confess to anything under the proper torture techniques. As recently as the George W. Bush administration torture was still in use. It was even crowed about to the press regarding the success level of such \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" by the Vice President of the United States.\"You give me a water board, Dick Cheney and one hour, and I'll have him confess to the Sharon Tate murders.\"(Larry King Live, May 11, 2009)\"― Jesse VenturaJakob has one ally, a young doctor named Simon Fronwieser who started spending a lot of time at the Kuisl household when he found that the hangman had books that were not only expensive, but in some cases had been banned from circulation. He had books by Dioscorides, Scultetus, Pare, Bartisch, and Paracelsus. Young Simon may have come for the books, but he stayed for the exclusive time he could steal with the beautiful Magdalena Kuisl, the hangman's daughter. One hangup for any future between the two young lovebirds is that offspring of the unclean profession of the hangman must marry in their own family. In fact much to her chagrin Magdalena is engaged to marry a cousin, a rather unappealing creature with a bovine appearance from a nearby town.Is the Devil loose in Schongau?The characters of Jakob and Simon added so much additional enjoyment for me while reading this book. They are learned, inquisitive men who understand the world is not black and white, but a rainbow of shades of gray. What an interest concept to have a man such as Jakob, who decides that despite his misgivings about the inhumane aspects of torture, that he best serves his community by remaining in a profession he loathes. It is the only way to insure that justice is properly meted out to those that deserve it, and compassion can be dispensed to those he has no chance to save from injustice.I liked this book much more than I expected. Potzsch sprinkles in enough aspects of 17th century Bavarian society to give the reader a feel for the place, but he does not weigh the text down with too much historical detail. Personally I like my books with as much weight as a writer wants to throw at me, but in this case he has successfully created a historical murder mystery that is compulsively readable. Mr. Potzsch is actually descended from the Kuisl family who were in fact hangmen. Now the first reaction one might have to discovering they are descended from such a scourged profession might be to feel a bit disgusted, but after the initial nausea passes think of the fascination in researching such a genealogy. I'm pleasantly surprised and look forward to reading the rest of the entries in this series.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"

        "user_review": "(Updated 1.30)1.27.11 (20% read) Having a difficult time with this one. That's what I get for jumping on the popularity bandwagon. So far, the titular character has been on one page. ONE! WTF translators?!! Was this the original title? And it just feels a bit anachronistic, nothing (so far) I can really put a finger on, but I'm wondering if this is \"new novelist\" or \"uninspired translation,\" or just plain sophomoric writing?Meh. It'll get better, right? I hope... Last time I succumbed to \"everybody's reading it,\" I got shafted withThe Historian.Please, Book Gnomes, don't let this be another one of those...1.29.11finished! That wasn't so bad! I still can't figure out why it was calledThe Hangman's Daughter,since she really played a tertiary role in the storyline. Heck, even the Leper House got more face time than the daughter, Mary Sue, err... I mean, Magdalena.It's not so much that this was poorly written, because it wasn't. Sentences flowed well, dialogue made sense, people did things. It just felt uninspired. There was so much rich history to work with here, and yet, the history turned out to be such a bit player, just a background to the incessant \"she's a witch! Let's burn her!\" \"No, we have to torture a confession out of her first!\" vs. \"pssst, I know you're not a witch, so imma torture you just a little bit, to buy some time. We still friends?\"There's also the basic plot device of a shadowy unidentified villain, who is behind the crime spree that has been pinned on the suspect witch. Even though we get to see the character as part of the story, there's little hint of his motivation.Not surprisingly, this novel has been something of a runaway bestseller. I suppose I shouldn't be perplexed, because it's one of those reads where you don't really have to strain your mind, or even remember anything. It's not quite book club pablum, because there is a story here, but all punches have been pulled, and the story has been watered down to \"crowd pleaser.\"You beer enthusiasts know exactly what I mean. Think of your FAVORITE brewpub, with the most unusual beers – hoppy, malty, maybe a touch of anise, maybe it's organic, perhaps an imperial – and what is the pub's bestseller? \"Amber.\" Or Coors Lite.Why is Lipton Tea the most popular tea in American? There are so many wonderful, amazing teas, and it's nearly the exact same preparation method, except instead of \"sweepings and fannings,\"(the teeny tiny dusty bits they sweep off the tables into teabags,) you get actual leaf. No comparison.Sheeple.Frustration. I can't even load this into my \"so bad it pissed me off\"category, because it wasn't so bad. It DID piss me off, because it could have been SO MUCH BETTER.But of course, if this book had lived up to its potential, it probably never would have seen publication. (There's cynicism for you.) People want pablum. The vast majority of bestsellers are powdered milk, Coors Lite, Lipton – stories that could-have-been.I did learn a lot about Leprosy, well, not from this book, but because I was skeptical that leprosy had played such a large role in medieval Europe. Interestingly, I discovered that it was indeed epidemic around the 11th through the 13th centuries, and was probably spread as a result of soldiers returning from the Crusades. It's estimated that there were as many as 20,000 leper houses spread throughout Europe by the late 12th century (thank you public library librarian.)Unfortunately for the historicity of this novel, which suggests that every city has its own leper house, the events are occurring in themid 17th century, by which time leprosy was mostly a non-starter, with only a few isolated cases/isolated sanatoriums which housed the relatively few sufferers. (Wikipedia tells me that Norway had an epidemic in the early 19th century, notable for it's exception.)All of this creates a time problem. For the leprosy to be period-correct, the story would have to be staged over 300 years earlier. But witch burning in Europe reached a peak in the mid- 16th century, which makes it time-correct for the setting of this novel. One or the other critical story elementhas to be anachronisticif the author is determined to keep both elements. These issues did not exist in equal import simultaneously in Europe.Witch hunts are an incredible and unbelievable viewing scope into religious intolerance, hysteria, misconception and suspicion. Here again, we get barely the framework of a story. Here again, we have something that could have been so much more. And here again, we have something that, had it been so much more, might not have been marketable.Which is why, ultimately, the story frustrated me. I learned some fascinating things because of questions sparked by the novel, but I didn't learn them from the novel. I don't expect stories I read to become textbooks – in fact, I don't want them to be. But historical novels can be so much more than simply mindless entertainment. They can give us a backward look at where we came from, and insight into our modern trajectory.\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" ~George Santayana"

Es war großartig!Ab der ersten Seite hatte mich die Geschichte schon gefangen. Sie spielt im Jahr 1659; eine sehr spannende und gefährliche Zeit. In diesem Buch geht es um eine unschuldige Hebamme, die plötzlich für den Tod eines Kindes verantwortlich gemacht wird und als Hexe verbrannt werden soll.Der Henker ist überzeugt von ihrer Unschuld und versucht gemeinsam mit dem Medicus, diese Unschuld zu beweisen.Ich fand die Geschichte superspannend und faszinierend und die Dialoge zwischen Henker und Medicus zeitweise auch richtig humorvoll.Alles in allem rundum gelungen! Ich freue mich, noch einige Bücher aus der Reihe vor mir zu haben!"

        "user_review": "A strong and enjoyable debut of a new series set in Schongau, Germany. The setting was the main reason I decided to give this series a try. Usually, historical mysteries happen either in London or somewhere in the US. This is why The Hangman's daughter is a breeze of fresh air in the genre.1659. Schongau's Hangman, Jakob Kuisl is a feared man, avoided because of superstitions but also sought out for his healing skills. His daughter is too smart for a young girl and follows into her dad's shoes with her knowledge of plants and their healing properties. Simon, the physician's son is interested in the new medicine methods and is seeking guidance from the hangman. The bonus is that he gets to see his daughter. When a child is found dead in a river bearing a strange mark known in witching practices and the town's midwife is arrested, the three heroes start together to find the true killer.The mystery was interesting enough, I did not guess the culprit and I enjoyed the characters. However, the book was a bit too long and some parts were a bit repetitive. Moreover, I don't understand why the book (and the series) is called the Hangman's Daughter. She is one of the three main characters but maybe the one less important. Jakob Kuisl would be the star if i were to peak one of them but i believe the Shongau murders or something else would be more suitable.I already bought the next one as it was on offer so I will continue with the series, hopefully it will get better and better."

When a midwife is accused of witchcraft, the hangman tries to solve the mystery of who is killing young orphaned children, all bearing a strange symbol on their bodies.The politics and superstitions of that time seemed authentic.

        "user_review": "I really enjoyed this historical thriller. It gives us a snapshot into the life of transitioning to modern period / medieval Germans. It just has a very authentic ring to it. Although, the translator uses some rather modern language here and there in his translation...it was originally written in German. In fact the authors family is the actual family of our hangman in the title. This hangman is a 5th generation executioner, a medicine man, and a tough guy. He and the mid-wife in the town share helpful solutions back and forth when someone is ill...midwives were notoriously suspected of witchcraft whether they partook of quackery or not. When someone starts slaughtering children of the village, one by one, she is quickly suspected, thrown in jail and tortured to confess....by our hangman, who is also trying to find the true culprit before he has to burn her at the stake. Lots of twists and turns, and much learning of Germany in the meantime. Great read."

        "user_review": "The Hangman's Daughteris not quite the right title for this book. Yes the main character is a hangman, Jakob Kuisl, and yes, he's got a daughter, but this is not her story. She's not the main protagonist. The hangman is.The Hangman's Daughteris basically a mystery about some child murders.The book starts off with Jakob as a boy witnessing a gristly, botched execution. It's a shocking scene – grim and edgy. It perfectly captures the ghoulishness of 17th century, public, capital punishment.Unfortunately it's the most powerful scene in this book.After readingThe Last Valley, I always figured that Germany was a wasteland after The Thirty Years War. There's no doubt that the Sack of Magdeburg in 1630 was a bloody slaughter. Out of 30,000 people, only 5,000 survived. Thousands of charred bodies were dumped in the Elbe River for fourteen days to prevent disease. By 1648, only 450 people were left in the city. I'm sure any person who witnessed this event could never be left unscathed. In fact, the Captain fromThe Last Valleysays,'God? There is no God. He died at Magdeburg.'So this is another horrible event that Jakob Kusil witnesses, and it's left him a hard and grizzled man. He's an interesting character. The son of a hangman, he left his village to find his fortune as a soldier only to find death. Now he's a jack of all trades, working as an executioner and as an apothecary. Does he try to heal people to ease his conscious? I'd like to think so, but this is definitely not fully explored. Jakob is a likable detective, but he's not wildly complex.In fact, most of the characters aren't wildly complex. I decided there are three kinds of people in this book. There are the good guys (Jakob and his buddies) who are trying to solve the mystery. All of them are enlightened (unshackled by the superstition and hypocrisy of their time) well-read and they bathe. Then there are the townspeople who are mostly ignorant, greedy, unfeeling clods. And last but not least, there are the rogue soldiers who are the real bad guys. (To my surprise, there wasn't a single, lecherous, power-hungry priest.)The mystery is pretty predictable, and it seemed to take forever to get anywhere. The reasons the action wasn't moving was kind of lame too. For instance I still don't know why Jakob Schreevogl, the stovemaker, didn't do anything when his beloved, adopted daughter was abducted. Don't most parents go out and look for their children? I would have figured he'd have started ahue and cry, insisting that everybody get their torches and start looking for his baby. Instead he tells the hangman, 'let me know if you find her.' Wtf??And good grief the townspeople were obnoxious. I realize that their apathy and cruelty could be attributed to war, superstition, and the brutal time period, but that's not how it's presented. Instead these bunholes just seem to be an excuse as to why the mystery can't be solved sooner. Consequently, they annoyed the crap out of me. grrrrAnyway, I'm giving this book three stars. I did find the history surrounding the Kusil family intriguing, but I don't think it made up for the slow read and the annoying townspeople."

        "user_review": "This was a 3.5/4 for me. Basically I found this to be a very good genre crime novel set in 17th century Bavaria. There are good guys and bad guys, with the good guys using logic and rationality to solve a series of child murders before the killer strikes again, while others in the town think the murders are the result of witchcraft and devilry. The pages fly swiftly, the mystery is engrossing, and the historical setting is interesting. If you're looking for a morally uncomplicated historical mystery, this is a great choice.So what explains why I didn't rate it higher? At the time I picked this up, I was perhaps in the mood for something more morally and aesthetically challenging--something with complex characters and striking prose. This book doesn't really deliver those kinds of goods. I can't really fault the book--it is what it is--but I mention this because sometimes it's useful to know what's not in a book, so you're not looking for what you won't find."

        "user_review": "Overall, this book reads like a college research paper reworked the following term for a creative writing class in the spring of freshman year.I love good historical fiction, but this book just doesn't deserve the adjective. The first problem is the title. The Hangman's daughter is wonderful, but a very minor character. I learned after the fact that it's a translation (poorly done) and based on the author's family which explains his fawning view of the hangman. There were a number of anachronisms and odd facts that just jumped out at me and just general oddities. Could villagers have eaten carrots in the spring? Where did they get them? The translation (and possibly the German, I don't know) included much modern phrasing. I certainly don't expect archaic German, but the language should match the setting. There were a number of characters, too many to track, so I ended just waiting to see which were significant. I felt at many points that the author was simply hiding things from us to create suspense because he couldn't think of any other way to achieve it. I almost stopped reading when one character, a poor old woman in a tiny village pulled down a paper calendar with a picture of a saint for this month. Really? It's bad enough to suppose that she didn't know what feast was coming up, but that anyone in that era would use valuable paper for something as trivial as a calendar, and mark holidays? And include a picture? How did this picture get created in the 1600's? Engraving I suppose. Yeesh.The biggest problem for me was the Hangman. What a potentially interesting character. We see parts of his struggles with his role, but in the end his doubts and despair just disappear. He's also a little too perfect. Why are physicians in historical novels always so wise in modern medicine? I can accept a hangman who is well read, understands herbs etc. But he's also apparently the best doctor in what will be called Germany (though these characters refer to Germany which presages Bismark by 200 years). How did he get his hands on the latest, and coincidently the most accurate medical texts in Europe? He is the strongest, smartest, calmest and most advanced person in town.Finally, the characters were all 1 dimensional. Good or evil or just confusing. Their motivations were weak. Why does the hangman care so much? Why do the villains care so much? How does a little town have so many bailiffs?In the end, I feel bad for the readers hooked into this thinking it's great historical fiction when there is so many better novels out there."

        "user_review": "Once I got into this, it was very good. It just took a bit of world building because you have a whole village to get set up in, another time, another culture, well, just like any other new place. I was worried because of this that I would forget who was whom.Well, there is a guide in the front of major players and really you will get to know those whom matter sooner than later. Don't let the cast of characters, nor the beginning, nor all the use of German scare you off.It's really cool. I had German in college so a lot made sense to me. But the things I needed help on was right there for me. It was like I was transported back into time and into the narrative of this village.The story involved much mystery, suspense, history, and many unique and quite interesting characters. It was enjoyable & so inspiring that this man wrote the story by researching his own family which actually did contain a village hangman. Just reading about the every day life of the man in this book really gave quite an interesting point of view.For this story, you just have to have an open mind that wants to learn and a bit of patience. You can't expect everything to be happening— wow— bang! —splat!!I was so hoping the entire time as I read along that the mystery would be put together and that all pieces would fit.. I got nervous, but loved the end result.Recommended.I'm going to read more of this series!"

        "user_review": "I have read some reviews that say this is not about the Hangman's daughter, but about The Hangman (Jakob) & The Physician (Simon). I thought Magdalena played a key role - and I liked the strong female characters throughout the story. The midwives & also Jakob, being thought of as witches by the very same people that come knocking upon their doors after dark for a potion, or to help deliver a baby.So well described are the people - the \"devil with his bone hand\" is truly frightening. The detail of the life & times of 1659 is great. The way the Hangman must do horrible jobs, for the whole town, yet no one will make eye contact with the man. Once as he was walking Jakob came upon a cart stuck in the path - he, without being asked put his shoulder to it & freed the cart. No thanks, no offer of would you like a ride since we are going the same way? The stigma of being around a Hangman or his family prevents Magdalena from men because they marry within the profession, and the boys of the family grow up to take over from their fathers.Simon breaks that & spends time with Magdalena, Jakob with Simon & Magdalena's help try to solve the mystery of the missing & murdered children.Well written & informative - with great character development.I started telling my husband about the book - 7 chapters in, he was interested, so I started to read a couple of chapters to him. Then I just could not wait & kept 2 bookmarks in it, I have finished now, but if he wants to know the rest I will read it to him. I have to like a book enough to do that! :)"

        "user_review": "Very well-researched.A town in the grip of a witch craze, children gone missing or turn up dead, treasure, torture and forbidden love. This is Jakob Kusil's world where he looms over the town like a dark shadow as he plays the role of the hangman. Can Jakob and his trusted friend Simon solve the mystery and discover the perpetrator before all is lost?Okay first off, this book was beautifully written. even though it was written in another language originally it translates very beautifully to English. A lot of times when I read books that were originally written in a different language and then translated to English they come out very choppy. Not so with this book.I found the book astonishingly well-researched for the time period and especially the torture devices mentioned in the book. I also found it surprisingly and delightfully gory which I was not expecting at all.I got the Kindle version of this book and it is the first book that I've ever encountered that has the animation in it. I think that it was a nice touch because it helps you to envision the scenes a little bit better however the animation and illustrations themselves seemed a little juvenile especially for the content of the book. Perhaps if they would have made them more shadowy black and white figures instead of in color cartoonish characters it would have been more flattering to the story.There is a lot going on in this book. The storyline in the beginning is like a murder mystery but it does not read like one. Then towards the end you get to treasure hunting. There is just so much going on in this book and it's hard to keep track. I personally think that it is a good read and it does keep your interest however it also falls flat in places because there is so much going on. It's almost like the author couldn't decide where he wanted to go with the book. Because of these things perhaps the book was a little longer than it should have been.I have one last quirrel with this book and that is the title. Magdalena does not have a big enough part in this book in order to warrant the name of the book itself. I think that she should have gotten a bigger role in the story. this sets the reader up for disappointment because as you are reading you keep waiting and waiting for Magdalena to have a bigger role and unfortunately she never does. Perhaps she does in the series but that still doesn't warrant the first book to brandish her title.All in all it was a very good and enjoyable read. I really did enjoy it. And I would definitely recommend it to those looking for a good historical fiction."

I listened to the audio version and the narrator was perfect for this. The world building was wonderful, felt like I was back in time and living in this world. The characters were well developed. The book has suspense, mystery, superstition, murder, and more. I did enjoy this unusual book."

        "user_review": "\"If you want to know who is responsible for anything, ask who benefits from it.\"― Oliver Pötzsch, The Hangman's DaughterWell....congratulate me. My first DNF of the new year!It isn't that I did not like what I was reading. It isn't that I thought this book was bad. I also am not rating it as I have a rule that I must read 50 percent of the book if I rate. I only got to around 15 percent.So...I chose not to go on because I am getting bolder about putting aside books I just do not like enough to finish. So many books. So little time!And this just did not intrigue me enough. If it were shorter I'd have gone on. But I am a pretty fast reader and I felt I'd been reading for HOURS....And still my kindle said 2 percent. Maybe I just didn't like it all that much.The thing is....it's been on my radar. I love Historical Fiction and hangmen and accusations of witchcraft...sounded great.The beginning was chilling. I thought I was hooked.All I can say is so many characters in so little time, story a bit muddled, very slow moving and when I am looking at the clock thinking \"how much longer\" well then I realize the book may not be for me.I WAS TEMPTED TO FLIP TO THE END but honestly I'd like to try to read this in the future. I think it is going to take some time so I will choose not to cheat and peak but rather put this aside for another day."

        "user_review": "This book describes a historic time, place, and environment (1660—Schongau, Germany—witchcraft fear) within which a fictional murder mystery plot is placed. In this fictional plot we meet the town's executioner whose task is to torture a woman to force a confession so she can be burned at the stake for witchcraft. The town officials believe that such an execution will calm down the widespread belief among the townspeople that the woman's witchcraft is causing the death of children and other sorts of bad luck.The problem is that the executioner knows—and certainly the twentieth century readers of this story agree—that this woman is innocent. Not only is she innocent, she is a friend to orphan children and a midwife and healer for poor people. The executioner, his daughter, and her boyfriend work together to try to solve the mystery of the children's murder in time to save this poor innocent woman. The plot contains a touch of romance to keep the reader cheering for young love in the face of community disapproval. However, the plot also has aspects to keep the reader fearful for what will happed to the condemned woman. This woman's prospects appear to be quite hopeless all through the book.In case the reader isn't aware how gruesome seventeenth century executions can be, the book's \"Preface\" begins with a botched execution that took place in the same town thirty-six years earlier. After being exposed to this initial shocking story the reader is aware that executions in those days were not intended to be humane.And in case that's not shocking enough, the reader is made aware of an incident that occurred in this same town two generations earlier in which sixty-one witches were executed—mostly women. It is hinted by the book's narrative that history may repeat itself if the hangman, daughter and her boyfriend are unsuccessful at solving this mystery and stopping the witch hysteria.At the end of the book there's \"A Kind of Postscript\" in which the reader is informed that the author is a genealogical descendant of the historical Schongau executioners.\"Supposedly more than sixty executions were carried out by my bloodstained ancestor during the Schongau witch trials of 1589 alone.In other words, this novel's depiction of a community's fear of witchcraft is based on actual historical happenings, however the details of this book's murder-mystery plot are fictional.I read the Kindle ebook version that contains good illustrations. The original book was written in German and translated into English. The author has written a number of sequels to this book that are part of the \"Hangman Series.\"One of the reasons I was interested in the book is because I have previously read a nonfiction book about executioners of that era titled, \"The Faithful Executioner: Life and Death, Honor and Shame in the Turbulent Sixteenth Century,\" by Joel F. Harrington ."

        "user_review": "The Hangman's DaughterA book I read by accident-This is because I clicked the right button but in the wrong browser tab and I accidentally bought the Kindle edition of this book when I really wanted was another book by the same author,Der Spielmann, depicting the life of the historical Johann Georg Faustus. But never mind. The wrong decision turned out to be the right one after all.April 1659. A boy is found dead on the banks of the river Lech near the town of Schongau in Bavaria. Obviously the child was murdered. Tattooed on the boy's shoulder the good townsfolk find a strange looking symbol which stirs up dark memories. Is it possible that a witch dwells among them? Again? Who you gonna call? Robert Langdon won't be available for at least another 300 years and the \"Büttel\" (the policemen, court officials, or whatever you like to call them) are either dumb, drunk, or sleeping on the job. The best man capable of investigating a crime like this would be the local hangman, Jakob Kuisl. He's smart, experienced, and strong-minded. And above all, he is not superstitious. Unfortunately, he is also something of a pariah. Although tolerated and needed, people rather make the sign of the cross than wishing him a good morning when they see him on the street. For the city leaders, the case is clear from the outset anyway. It was the midwife. Men have always been suspicious of these women, who know about the female secrets. And they know potions and herbs, and they touch other women at indecent spots. They also knew how to remove the fruit in the body, this \"gift of God\". Ergo: The midwife is a witch and murderer. Case closed. All that is needed is her confession, under torture when necessary. And this is were Jakob Kuisl comes into play, because torturing is part of his job (other parts include garbage collector and medical practitioner). The hangman doesn't believe in the midwife's guilt and secretly conducts an investigation by himself in which he is aided by Simon Fronwieser, who is the son of the town's physician, and who not only has an eye for the hangman's impressive library of medical textbooks but also (and mostly) on his eldest daughter Magdalena, a young woman how is as pretty as she is smart. Soon a second child is found dead and things start to escalate…I wasn't so much interested in the actual murder-mystery story, although it contains all the necessary ingredients of the genre which makes it exciting and a page-turner. Plus: It contains \"the devil\" himself – or perhaps not? For me, the description of life (and death) in a city in Germany in the middle of the 17th century, not long after the 30-year war, was the most captivating. Here the author obviously has done his homework and presents the results in a credible way. In an afterword he writes:This book is a novel and not a scientific seminar paper. I have tried to stick to the facts as much as possible. Nevertheless, I often had to simplify for dramatic reasons.Besides, I never gave much thought on what an executioner actually does when he is not executing. In the book and also on the author's website you can learn a lot more about this rather strange profession, and also that Jakob Kuisl actually existed and was even a distant ancestor of the author:http://oliver-poetzsch.de/en/die-welt...Also, I'm generally interested in the 30-year War. Even though it ended over a decade ago, this war still casts a shadow on the people. All protagonists are dragging around their own experiences. In some flashbacks, for example, the euphemistically called \"Magdeburg Wedding\" is shown in some very brutal images. In general it can be said that the book is not necessarily something for the faint at heart. Right in the prologue, for example, an execution is described which is carried out by the father of Jakob Kuisl (and which fails thoroughly). And then there are the scenes in which the alleged \"witch\" gets tortured. But here the author also holds back a little, and the violence is clearly not shown for its own sake, but necessary to drive the plot. And those things happened, alas.Even tough this book has over 500 pages I would have read it faster than I did. After all, the author calls it an \"entertainment novel\", and that is true. The prose is not particularly challenging. Nevertheless, I had to take a break every now and then and start my own little researches. Sometimes the most interesting things hide behind the smallest details. For instance there's a book mentioned calledDe Materia Medica. It's a textbook on herbal medicine in five volumes, written between 50 and 70 CE, and still in use in the 17th century (Jakob Kuisl owns a copy). Then there is theLex Carolina, a.k.a.Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, the first body of German criminal law, published in 1530, in which capital crimes are defined, like murder, manslaughter, etc… but alsowitchcraftand which also lists the possible death penalties: burning, decapitation, quartering, wheeling, hanging, drowning, impaling, and burying alive. As you can see, the hangman must bring quite a lot of skills. From this I also learned that \"peinliche Befragung\" doesn't mean \"awkward interrogation\" but rather \"painful interrogation\", i.e. torture, coming from the word \"Pein\" = \"pain\". Like I said, the devil's in the details.There are another six volumes of the hangman's daughter available (who, by the way, is important here, but not the main character). I don't think I'm going to read them all, but the second volume seems to be about aDark Monk. That sounds rather intriguing, especially since the church got away too easy in the first volume, I think.This work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."

        "user_review": "I may have discovered my perfect vacation read with this series! I remember it being on sale for Kindle, and thinking that a murder mystery set in 17th century Bavaria sounded cool… and then not really giving it a second thought for ages. When we left for a week by the lake, I decided to try and read everything still unread on my Kindle and I was reminded of \"The Hangman's Daughter\". As soon as I was done, I immediately downloaded the second book and devoured that one, too!In the village of Schongau, the hangman, Jakob Kuisl, leads an interesting life: his work keeps him on the fringe of society, but people discreetly visit him and his daughter Magdalena, as they are better healers than the town's physician. When a small child is fished out of the river, beaten to death, with a strange mark inked on his skin, people immediately suspect the local midwife. Kuisl know she had nothing to do with it, but he is charged with torturing her until she confesses. When more similarly marked children are found dead and the villagers' paranoia increases, the hangman, his daughter, and Magdalena's suitor (ironically, the son of the useless local physician) realize they have very little time to find the actual murderer and bring him to justice to save the midwife's life.If I had to review it in four words, I would just say: this was so cool. The description of life in a small German town in 1659 was fascinating, the characters are well-drawn out and the pacing kept me completely hooked. I was so excited when I realized that the author based this entirely fictional story on his ancestor – who was actually a hangman named Jakob Kuisl! So flipping rad! I knew little about this historical period, and was fascinated to learn about the social status of executioners and how their trade actually works. Of course, Potzsch has no idea what his ancestor was actually like, but he made Kuisl into an interesting and layered man, haunted by his past, living his life as honestly as he can, with a strong moral compass. And of course, the spirited Magdalena is just as clever as him - a strong female character that nevertheless remains perfectly believable for the time period.Obviously, I had so much fun reading this, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical murder-mysteries; you will not be disappointed with \"The Hangman's Daughter\"!"

        "user_review": "A medieval murder case in the Bavarian village Schongau, featuring a witch and the devil, is solved by the local hangman.In the beginning a bit slow, but towards the end really suspenseful.----------------------------------------Im bayerischen Schongau des 17. Jahrhunderts wurden etliche Waisenkinder ermordet aufgefunden. Alle haben sie dieselbe geheimnisvolle Tätowierung am Körper. Die gesunde Volksseele weiß natürlich sofort, dass es sich hierbei nur um Hexerei handeln kann und logischerweise muss die örtliche Hebamme die Hexe sein.Den Machthabern im Stadtrat ist zwar bewusst, dass die Hexengeschichte Unsinn ist, dennoch verfolgen sie das Ziel die Hebamme schnellstmöglich auf den Scheiterhaufen zu bringen. Die einen, weil es politisch opportun ist und dem Machterhalt dient, die anderen weil sie, genauso wie das gemeine Volk, sich gerne an Folterungen und Verbrennungen erfreuen.Glücklicherweise kann das (unerwünscht arbeitende) Ermittlerteam bestehend aus dem Henker Jakob Kuisl, dem jungen Arzt Simon und der namensgebenden Henkerstochter Magdalena, die Sachlage aufklären und die Verbrecher (beinahe) vollständig ihrer gerechten Strafe zuführen.In der ersten zwei Dritteln las sich das Buch für mich sehr zäh und ich musste mich regelrecht zum weiterlesen zwingen, gegen Ende wurde es jedoch noch sehr spannend und ich konnte es flott beenden.Ich fand das Nachwort sehr interessant, in dem der Autor aufzeigt, dass er ein Nachkomme der Henkersdynastie Kuisl ist. Jakob Kuisl hat also wirklich existiert, obwohl der Autor starke Zweifel hat, ob er sich so verhalten hätte wie im Buch beschrieben.Ich möchte auch noch anmerken, dass ich das Buch zwar als historischen Krimi kategorisieren würde, aber für meinen Geschmack hat der Krimiaspekt hier deutlich die Überhand.Insgesamt hat mir das Buch dann doch eine Ecke besser gefallen, als ich zu Beginn vermutet hatte.Ich würde gerne 3,5 Sterne geben, finde aber dass es für 4 doch nicht ganz reicht. Daher muss ich wohl oder übel abrunden."

        "user_review": "I chose this book because of its being set in Bavaria (a part of Germany I have visited and really like), because of its rather original concept (a hangman as detective), and because of the many glowing reviews it has received. I feel cheated.Set in the village of Schongau in 1659, it revolves around the death and/or disappearance of several children. Martha Stechlin, the local midwife, is quickly suspected of being a witch and thought to be responsible. Jakob Kuisl, the hangman, must torture her to illicit a confession. He does not think she is guilty and sets out to investigate with the help of Simon Fronwieser, a doctor and would-be wooer of Magdalena, the hangman's daughter.One major flaw is the characters. There is an attempt to develop the hangman into a round character: he is strong, both physically and mentally. We feel sympathy for him because he possesses a heart of gold despite his occupation which makes him a social pariah in the village. The problem is that he is too good to be true; he is constantly performing last-minute, superhero-type rescues. Other characters also tend to be extremes, extremes of goodness or evil. The chief villain becomes known as the Devil, walks with a limp, and has a large facial scar, skeletal features and soulless eyes. Such stereotypical characters are not credible.Plotting is awkward. So the reader will not be able to identify the criminal mastermind (sophomorically referred to as Moneybags), many characters are introduced. The author equates confusing the reader with creating suspense. So as to not disclose locations, people speak of meeting \"at the assigned place.\" The ending has all the hallmarks of a poor-quality ending. Even the title of the book is a manipulation because Magdalena is neither a protagonist nor an antagonist.This book is a translation from the German. It is a deplorable translation, full of modern colloquialisms which are inappropriate to the historical setting. For example, at one point the hangman says, \"'If we don't have the true culprit by then, they won't screw around for long, and the midwife will be done for.'\" Such linguistic anachronisms jar.The translator could be blamed for the weak writing, were it not for the needless repetitions throughout. How often does the reader need to be told that the contents of chamber pots were tossed out windows onto the street? The description of \"Jakob Kuisl clench[ing] his fist around a rock so hard that the edges cut into his flesh(299)\" is followed very closely by further clarification should the reader have missed the point: \"He had clenched the rock so hard that its edges had dug into his flesh like knives (301).\"The one positive aspect of the book is the information it provides about life in seventeenth-century Germany. Unfortunately, this information (on such topics as social structure, leprosy, trade practices, and belief in witchcraft)is often delivered in such a way that the book reads like a historical treatise rather than a mystery. The author is a descendant of the Kuisl dynasty of executioners, and, at times, the book seems just a showpiece for the historical research done by Fritz Kuisl, the cousin of the author's grandmother.To conclude: original concept but poor 'execution'Please check out my blog (http://schatjesshelves.blogspot.ca/) and follow me on Twitter (@DCYakabuski)."

I was surprised to find out, at the end of the book, the book is based on historical facts for the most part; as well as it being about his family history. We all want to know who our ancestors are; but to find out you can from a long line of hangman would be so shocking."

        "user_review": "The Hangman's Daughteris the first in a series of historical mysteries set in seventeenth-century Bavaria, and combines a historical background and characters with a fictional plotline to give us an interesting but intense read.The book takes us to the town of Schongau, where Jakob Kuisl is the hangman/executioner, having taken over the job from his father, though as the prologue tells us, an incident in his childhood had made him swear off the work. He is also well versed in medical knowledge (from practice and self-education rather than any formal training) and has an enviable library from which the local doctor's son, Simon Fronweiser (a doctor himself) often borrows books (much to his own father's disapproval). As the hangman, Jakob is necessary for the town yet feared and seen as bad luck so while people visit him for his medical knowledge, they often refuse to acknowledge him and keep out of his (or his family's) path. Jakob lives with his wife Anna Marie, oldest daughter Magdalena, and two smaller children, twins Georg and Barbara. While Magdalena is clever and does find some information and clues, it is mostly Jakob and Simon that do the investigating in this one.The events on which our story focuses—the entire mystery—play out within the space of a week—25 April to 1 May 1659. Our story opens with a little boy, Peter Grimmer, son of a wagon driver, Josef Grimmer, being found badly wounded in the river Lech. While some men pull him out and send for the doctor, by the time Simon arrives, it is too late and the boy is dead. The people, particularly, the wagon-drivers are convinced that this is the work of the Augsburg wagon-drivers for under the arrangements in place, they can carry goods only till Schongau after which wagoners from Schongau alone can carry goods forward depriving the Augsburgers of profit. Also some Augsburg drivers had had a serious brawl with little Peter's father. But on examining Peter's body, besides the wounds, a strange mark is found which is immediately taken to be a symbol of witchcraft. Things soon blow out of proportion, and a mob targets Martha Stechlin, one of the local midwives, with whom Peter and other orphan children from town were known to spend time. She is initially arrested for her safety but people are out for blood, and when more of the children from their group are targeted, Johann Lechner, the court clerk decides to try Martha for witchcraft.As hangman, Jakob Kuisl is in-charge of interrogating (read: torturing) Martha (who has helped bring his own children, besides other village children into the world), and he knows she is innocent. But unless he does his job, he will lose his position and someone else will be called in. Kuisl tries to protect Martha while also buying time to investigate the matter and find out who was responsible. But time is running out for the rumours and superstition are rife and townspeople are demanding Martha be burned at the stake!This was a rather intense read with the tension palpable all through, but one which kept me reading all the same. Martha is innocent and despite Jakob and Simon, and indeed even the court clerk Lechner knowing it, she is to be subjected to torture and even 'sacrificed'—it being the only outcome that will satisfy the superstitious (and bloodthirsty) people. While reading, finds oneself tense up, shudder and even feel near ill when poor Martha is mistreated and tortured (Jakob with his knowledge of herbs does help her avoid the pain as far as he can, but even he is helpless on some occasions), and one hopes the solution is found soon. Pressed for time and the urgency to not only find a solution to the mystery but a way for Martha to be absolved of the allegation against her, Jakob and Simon investigate the matter and find themselves pitted against the 'devil' himself, a man with a skeleton for a hand, and a lust for torture, who is on the trail of the children. The mystery isn't a very simple one, and they must work out who is involved and why. The solution in itself was quite interesting, and while for a fair way into the book I could not work out who was responsible, about two-thirds of the way in, one conversation pointed me in the right direction.Reading the book, I got the impression that the historical events referenced like the horrific witch trials of 1589 in which over 60 women were burnt were real-life (which I confirmed on good old Google later). What I didn't realise until reading the author's afterword was that Jakob Kuisl and his family too, were historical characters, and in fact, the author's own ancestors.Jakob comes across as a really interesting character, for despite the job that he does (and this was far different from and worse than I realised), he is an intelligent and well-read man and also one full of compassion, more so than the so-called 'common' people, and of course, those in power. He uses his medical knowledge to help townsfolk that need it (his job protecting him to an extent from sorcery accusations), and in his job as hangman ensures that the innocent don't suffer but those that deserve it get their just punishment. What I hadn't realised before reading this book was that the hangman at that point in time didn't only 'hang' people—death sentences took many forms, from hanging to beheading to burning at the stake, and all of it was his job. Also, he was responsible for torturing people in interrogations and also keeping the town clean of refuse and dead animals. The job carries a heavy burden and Jakob takes to drink before the worst he must carry out, and one feels for him at such times.Dealing with the time period, and the themes it does, this book does have a lot of torture and violence and quite a bit of it does take place on the page, but I thought the author put it across quite subtly, so it even if one does feel very unsettled, it isn't to the point to wanting to not read on.I found this a really interesting read especially for the historical setting and characters. The mystery was an engrossing one as well ends with a mix of fear, excitement and drama.4.25 stars."

        "user_review": "I liked the last quarter of this book, I struggled with the first three-quarters. I had some issues with the translation. In addition to the flow being off for me in places, there were phrases and words that I had to stop and read again to understand what was meant. In the first half of the book, I found myself skimming large sections of descriptions that did not seem pertinent.I had a hard time keeping the lesser characters in the book straight, and that was undoubtedly due to my own inability to remember foreign names. It wasn't that I disliked the book, don't get me wrong, I think it was well written for the most part.I thought, because the book was called The Hangman's Daughter that Magdelena would have played a more important role in the book and/or would have been an exciting character, I found however, that I related much more to her father, the hangman, Jakob. He was by far my favorite.When I made it to the last quarter of the book, I could not put it down, it was exciting and action packed. I really enjoyed the last of it. I was completely unable to predict how the book would end, which is a trademark of a good read in my mind.I would say if you are interested in historical fictions that center around witch hunts in Germany in 1660's, or if you are into the history and lives of executioners in that same time period, then you should definitely check this out.I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but since I have an affinity for everything witches, I have decided to bump it up to 4 stars for the rating."

        "user_review": "Otkad je svijeta i vijeka, ljudi su uvijek njegovali različite sustave vjerovanja, imali božanstva kojima se klanjaju, ali i zle duhove i demone od kojih su zazirali i nadali se da će ih od njih njihova božanstva zaštititi. Kroz vrijeme su, na temelju tih vjerovanja, nastale razne narodne predaje koje su se prenosile s koljena na koljeno i koje žive do današnjeg dana. Kao što to obično biva na pozornici povijesti, vjerovanja su se iz stoljeća u stoljeće modificirala ili međusobno svrgavala, mirnim ili nasilnim putem.U jednom takvom procesu nastala je i legenda o vješticama. Prema narodnim vjerovanjima, vještice su bile žene koje su se bavile vještičarenjem kako bi stekle nadnaravne moći, obično u zle svrhe, iako su postojale iznimke bijelih vještica, odnosno vještica koje svoje moći koriste u dobre svrhe. Iako se ustalio naziv vještica, zapravo se radilo o sljedbenicima starih poganskih vjerovanja koja su u uskim krugovima nadživjela pojavu i širenje kršćanstva u Europi i svijetu, stoga je Crkva poprijeko gledala na takve prakse.Strah od nepoznatog navodio je ljude da vještice optuže za svako zlo koje se u društvu događa, bila to loša godina u usjevima, bolest, ili pak ubojstva. Prečesto je sjena sumnje bačena i na one koji se s vještičarenjem nisu ni susreli, a kamoli njime bavili. Zbog toga su mnoge žene, ali i muškarci, dugi niz stoljeća bili proganjani, mučeni i ubijani.U takvo jedno društvo, u takvo jedno vrijeme, vodi nas vremeplov Olivera Pötzscha. Radnju svog romana Krvnikova kći smjestio je u 17. stoljeće u bavarski gradić Schongau, koji se u to vrijeme još uvijek oporavljao od Tridesetogodišnjeg rata i njegovih posljedica, kao što su glad, siromaštvo, raznorazne bolesti, djeca bez roditelja i žene bez muževa. Gradić koji, kao da nema dovoljno problema na svojim ulicama, potresa ubojstvo siročića kojem je na ramenu pronađen tetovirani simbol za koji se vjeruje da je vještičji. Vrlo brzo sumnjičavi pogledi usmjereni su prema Marthi Stechlin, primalji kod koje je pokojni dječak bio redoviti gost, zajedno s još nekoliko djece.Zadatak izvlačenja priznanja mučenjem iz optužene Marthe dobio je krvnik Jakob Kuisl. Krvnik je uvjeren u Marthinu nevinost i želi podrobnije istražiti okolnosti koje su dovele do ubojstva siročeta, no gradski oci, kako bi smirili duhove u gradu, žele njeno priznanje što prije. Jakob se, zajedno sa svojom prelijepom kćerkom Magdalenom i njenim udvaračem, sinom gradskog medikusa Simonom, nađe u tijesnoj utrci s vremenom kada se pronađe leš još jednog siročeta, dvoje ih misteriozno nestane, a u pitanju je još djece koja su vrijeme provodila kod osumnjičene primalje.Kada u svojim rukama držite knjigu na čijim se koricama autor proziva neokrunjenim kraljem njemačkog povijesnog romana, teško je primiriti očekivanja kako bi se roman mogao doživjeti i objektivno ocijeniti, osobito kad njegova fabula izgleda jako poznato.Krvnikova kći neodoljivo podsjeća na opus Marije Jurić Zagorke i njezin ciklus Grička vještica. Iako su radnje dvaju ciklusa smještena u različita razdoblja i imaju u fokusu različite likove, veže ih proces koji je kroz više stoljeća obilježio povijest Europe, a to je inkvizicija, progon vještica i sve njegove popratne aktivnosti, uz bitnu razliku da dvorske intrige nisu prisutne u Krvnikovoj kćeri kao što su u Gričkoj vještici.Koliko god to uvrnuto zvučalo s obzirom na vrijeme i događaje u koje nas vraća, ova vožnja vremeplovom bilo je jedno divno iskustvo. Iako su mnogi likovi i mnogi događaji izmišljeni, Krvnikova kći prava je poslastica od povijesnog romana. Što inače biva kod povijesnih romana, pred njihovim autorima veliki je izazov prenijeti ne samo događaje, već i duh i stanje uma vremena u koje nas vode. Ispit koji je Oliver Pötzsch uspješno položio.Atmosfera straha koja se stvara pri pojavi naizgled neobjašnjivih događaja, struktura i karakter gradskih moćnika jednog bavarskog gradića, upiranje optužujućeg prsta na temelju smješnih dokaza i procesi koji se provode samo da bi se proveli, pa makar i nedužna osoba bila okrivljena, kao i poneki grozni detalji mučenja, sve su to odlike ovog romana zahvaljujući kojima smo u potpunosti mogli doživjeti inkviziciju koja je nezaobilazna kada se priča o povijesti Europe od 12. do 19. stoljeća. Običaji jednog vremena savršeno su poslužili svrsi u autorovom stvaranju jedne misteriozne atmosfere s primjesama trilera i kriminalističkog romana.Sam naziv romana, Krvnikova kći, je sam po sebi jako neobičan, s obzirom na zastupljenost naslovnog lika u romanu. Iako smo, kroz radnju romana, upoznati s predivnom Magdalenom, fokus radnje ipak je na njezinom ocu, Jakobu, i njenom udvaraču Simonu. No, njenu pojavu ne valja samo tako zanemariti, jer puno toga je sposobna pokazati iz sjene.Jakob je, zahvaljujući obiteljskoj tradiciji, nesretni nasljednik krvničkog mača. Konstantno se sukobljava s obiteljskom tradicijom, ali i osobnom prošlošću i duhovima koje vuče za sobom. I koliko god se sukobljavao sa svojom prošlošću, odabire ostati u zanimanju koje prezire iz dubine duše, sve kako bi nastavio služiti društvu koje od njega, zbog njegove profesije, zazire. To vidi kao jedini način da se nevine zaštiti od nepravde, a da oni, koji su to zaslužili, ugledaju lice pravde i njenog suda.Jakobova kći Magdalena, po svim svojim obilježjima, bila bi klasičan primjer djeve u nevolji i nemoćne djevojke koja je trn u oku društva koje, u strahu od svega nepoznatog, se ne ustručava od stigmatizacije i brutalne osude pojedinaca koji se ne uklapaju u njegove kalupe. Magdalena je djevojka svjesna svoje ljepote, ali i stigme koju nosi kao krvnikova kći. Usprkos opasnosti koju to za sobom povlači, Magdalena koketira i pleše oko vatre odbijajući odgovarati društvenim normama koje su joj nametnute i kalupu koji je za nju oblikovan. Na sveopće zgražanje, poigrava se s društvom i njegovim vjerovanjima zajedno sa Simonom, njenim udvaračem i sinom gradskog medikusa, mladim učenjakom koji dijeli s Jakobom veliku strast prema knjigama o liječenju. Time se Magdalena svrstava uz bok mnogim inspirativnim heroinama koje govore mnogo više od riječi koje su prebacile preko svojih usta.Krvnikova kći rezultat je istraživanja obiteljskih korijena koje seže u daleku prošlost po kojem je Oliver Pötzsch potomak obitelji Kuisl koja je od 16. do 19. stoljeća bila glasovita bavarska dinastija krvnika. Osim što nam je dao jedan fantastičan povijesni roman s primjesama trilera i misterije, autor nam je dao i dio svoje obiteljske povijesti koju je, na sreću višemilijunske publike, još jednom vratio u život."

Based on this deadly dull \"thriller,\" major commercial publishing has nothing to worry about. I have no idea why it's called THE HANGMAN'S DAUGHTER, cause she doesn't play much of a role in the book. I have no idea why the translator of this book was chosen for the job, since he not only has zero understanding of pace but has no feel at all for the time period the book is set in -- 1659. Um, did they have \"grammar schools\" then? Or wear \"trousers?\" Or, my favorite -- \"if we don't have the true culprit by then, they won't screw around for long...\" Man, can't you just HEAR the folks of 1659 and how they talked in that sentence!The book is about a hangman taking it upon himself to investigate the murders of some orphans in his Bavarian town. He's a wise giant of a man, somewhat troubled by the nature of his job (which also includes torturing suspects in order to get a confession out of them) joined in his search for the murderer by a young physician just starting to question the old ways. Pages and pages of tedious description slow this book down to a halt repeatedly. Nothing about it ever came alive for me. I don't know how much is the author's fault or the translator's fault and I don't care -- both are men of limited talent. The author doesn't even address one of the the biggest stumbling blocks he sets up in the book regarding the desired marriage between the foppish young doctor and the hangman's daughter (laws of the time prevented members of a hangman's family from marrying anyone other than a member of another hangman's family), ending the book without ever resolving it. But it's not like I really cared -- about this, or anyone or anything in this jaw-popping bore of a novel."

        "user_review": "Are you looking for a Halloween Read? If so, I would recommend The Hangman's Daughter by Oliver Potzsch. It has been translated into English and was one of the free books given away by Amazon Crossing for World Book Day in April 2019. The Kindle edition is especially fun since it is a Book In Motion. Check out the fun animated video about the book on Amazon.The Hangman's Daughter is a whodunnit that takes place in Bavaria in 1659. I am confused by the title since it is not a tale about the hangman's daughter. She is undoubtedly one of the characters, but the focus is almost entirely on the hangman and a young physician who is in love with the hangman's daughter. The two men seek to find out who murdered two young orphans, to find two other missing orphans, and to save a midwife from being put to death as a witch.The other characters include dishonest politicians, ignorant townspeople, suspicious folk from a nearby village, unkind foster families, and evil henchmen, one of whom is so scary he is known as The Devil. This historical fiction novel has intrigue, murder, kidnapping, property damage, and bodily harm. All of this occurs in the midst of a system of beliefs where the hangman and his family were kept outside the city walls for being outcasts; witch hunts were still common; superstitions were believed; medicine was very primitive; and torture was considered the best way to get a confession, even if the accused was not guilty.Usually, I am terrible about figuring out whodunnit, but in this case, I had made a guess before page 200 and confirmed it before page 320. Even so, the book was an entertaining read and again, would be great for Halloween. It was my bookclub's July 2019 selection. We even played several rounds of the game Hangman as part of the evening. 4-Star"

        "user_review": "This story takes place in Bavaria in 1659. It is not really that much about the hangman's daughter, than it is about the hangman and the young physician in the town. There is a lot about torture and death that is a little uncomfortable to read about. But overall it was gripping and had compelling characters.He kind of marginalizes the daughter, actually. It is more of a 'man's' book. However, he does have her escape from her kidnappers on her own rather than having her father or her boyfriend rescue her. Also, I got the distinct feeling that her boyfriend puts learning and books first and her second."

        "user_review": "Life isn't long enough for love and art.Years ago I read and thoroughly enjoyed W. Somerset Maugham'sTheatre, so when I found a copy ofThe Moon and Sixpencein the bookcase, it looked the perfect breezy weekend diversion I was looking for before I would embark on the finale of Thomas Mann' sDoctor Faustus. Imagine my surprise having by chance run into a novel which also turned out to be a Künstlerroman , both novels sketching the development of two men who come to live only for their art, the (fictitious) composer Adrian Leverkühn in Mann's novel, and Charles Strickland, a painter modelled onPaul Gauguin, inThe moon and Sixpence- finding quite a few parallels between both novels.Apart from narrators cultivating a peculiar friendship with the respective artists and who plead for compassion and understanding for the ordeal of the artists they admired, both novels in some sense have a common view on the Artist, the key – Romantic- belief that one cannot have it both ways, the Artist has to choose between love and art (Maugham makes this belief explicit from the very beginning, his narrator declares that the artist's personality is the most fascinating aspect of his art, however repulsive his character or numerous his flaws ). The outcome of that choice doesn't have to come as a surprise, asLife isn't long enough for love and art.While Adrian Leverkühn sorely forsakes love in his pact with the devil in exchange for granting him creative genius, Strickland is portrayed as indifferent to love, abandoning his wife and children for his artistic obsessions, which also have a demonic touch. In both cases their choice will have fatal consequences, at least for others. Both are portrayed as monsters in the sense that they are dedicated artists, whose life is totally devoted to their art and so they display monstrous features, even if only in the eyes of those around them. They both consciously choose a hermit's existence, rejecting commonplace life and participation in society, claiming the freedom to live in an ivory tower for themselves – whether on a farm in Germany or a mansard in Paris (and Tahiti later on). Unlike Charles Strickland, however, Leverkühn is vexed by the monstrous nature of his artistry – Charles Strickland couldn't bother less.There are many brilliant reviews and analyses ofThe Moon and Sixpenceto find around here which do great justice to this novel as an outstanding work of literature. Nevertheless I am more on the side of these perspicacious reviews (hereandhere) which point out its inner contradictions and word astutely some of the impressions the novel left me with, encapsulating what becomes visible once the colours of Maugham's glowing prose have stopped to bedazzle.As much as the psychological portrayal of the selfish and obsessed painter is well done – from the little I recall from reading about the life of Gauguin the credibility is supreme (whereas assuaging some of the facts, for instance on his health condition, substituting syphilis by leprosy - it wasn't the uncouthness, egoism and brutality of artist protagonist Charles Strickland that put me off– after all, haven't those personality features turned into something one has almost come to expect in the Romantic view on the artist (the contrasts and tension between the ugliness and brutality of the personality versus the beauty he – as the genius is of course a man - pursuits to create)?It were mostly the rather nauseating generalisations on the nature of women, by Strickland and by almost every character featuring in the novel including the narrator, a writer in who one can recognise Maugham himself which simply baffled me (and made me imagine the narrator/Maugham as an even less likeable person than Strickland/Gauguin, which is quite a feat). At times this misogyny turns so pathetic it becomes rather fascinating – even raking up the discussion if women actually have a soul (which was apparently anon-discussion). So this novel left me puzzled and with plenty of questions buzzing in my mind. What was the status quaestionis with regard to misogyny in 1919? Was Maugham representative for his times, or was it mostly the bitterness because of his personal situation (trapped in loveless marriage while being homosexual) that made him spit out his loathing so viscerally that it came to overcast whatever points he makes on conventionalism and creativity? I hope to find some answers inA Brief History of Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice, even if it seems too brief to have the space to mention Maugham.When reading Deborah Levy'sThe Cost of Living: A Working AutobiographyI almost suspected myself of having turned into a sweet water feminist, as her recurrent blaming of patriarchy didn't much resonate with me. If one however would feel the need to fuel feminist energy,The Moon and Sixpencewould make good material to give to one's children or simple anyone who thinks feminism has become evident or superfluous nowadays, if only to see where we have come from. It must have been from the moment a co-worker started to singGirlsfrom the Beastie boys in the nineties ('girls do the dishes') I was confronted with something as blatantly misogynist/sexist as this book (admittedly, apart from this forum dedicated to books and some newspapers I read little on the internet and so am only vaguely aware of trolling of women who twitter as happened to Mary Beard).Just a few examples of statements to savour:When a woman loves you she's not satisfied until she possesses your soul. Because she's weak, she has a rage for domination, and nothing less will satisfy her.It requires a female temperament to repeat the same thing three times with unabated zest.Women are constantly trying to commit suicide for love, but generally they take care not to succeed.I did not then know the besetting sin of woman, the passion to discuss her private affairs with anyone who is willing to listen.Women are strange little beasts... You can treat them like dogs, you can beat them till your arm aches, and still they love you. He shrugged his shoulders. Of course, it is one of the most absurd illusions of Christianity that they have souls.... In the end they get you, and you are helpless in their hands. White or brown, they are all the same.Because women can do nothing except love, they've given it a ridiculous importance. They want to persuade us that it's the whole of life. It's an insignificant part. I know lust. That's normal and healthy. Love is a disease. Women are the instruments of my pleasure.What I had taken for love was no more than the feminine response to caresses and comfort which in the minds of most women passes for it. It is a passive feeling capable of being roused for any object, as the vine can grow on any tree; and the wisdom of the world recognizes its strength when it urges a girl to marry the man who wants her with the assurance that love will follow.On the plus side, the novel made me look more closely at some of the paintings of Paul Gauguin, which I now appreciate more, particularly the vitality of the colours in his still lives (Gauguin's painting never particularly spoke to me, I find it particularly hard not to look at his paintings through the lens of an exoticism that reeks of a mythologizing of the noble savage; I admit my not so favourable view on him was also negatively affected by reading this loosely biographical graphic novel some years ago,Gauguin: Off the Beaten Trackby Maximilien Le Roy).Maugham's novel offers lots of food for thought and could serve as an excellent exercise when one tries to consider a work of art independently from the personality of the creator – whether painter or writer. It made me aware I need more exercise on these issues and so I will definitely read more by Maugham."

        "user_review": "Fair warning, this is going to be a long review for this is a book that is close to my heart written by an author whom I deeply admire.The Right TimeThere are some books that walk into your life at an opportune time. I'm talking about the books that send a pleasant shiver down your spine laden with \"Man, this is meant to be!\" as you flip through its pages cursorily. Or those that upon completion, demand an exclamation from every book-reading fibre of your body to the effect of \"There couldn't have been a better time for me to have read this book!\" Now, I come from deferred-gratification stock. So books like these, you don't read immediately,. You let them sit there on your table for a while. You bask in the warm expectant glow of a life-altering read. You glance at the book as you make your way to office, take pleasure in the fact that it'll be right there on your table when you open the front-door wearily, waiting to be opened, caressed, reveled in. And when that moment of reckoning arrives, you don't stop, you plunge yourself straight into the book, white-hot passionate.The Moon and Sixpence was just that kind of a book for me. I had just completed (and thoroughly enjoyed) a course on Modern Art in college and could rattle off the names of Impressionist painters faster than I could the Indian cricket team. I was particularly intrigued by Paul Gauguin, a French Post-Impressionist painter, after reading one of his disturbingly direct quotes.\"Civilization is what makes me sick\", he proclaimed, and huddled off to Tahiti to escape Europe and \"all that is artificial and conventional\", leaving behind a wife and five children to fend for themselves, never to make contact with them again. This struck me as the ultimate expression of individuality, a resounding slap to the judgmental face of conservative society, an escapist act of repugnant selfishness that could only be justified by immeasurable artistic talent, genius, some may call it. My imagination was tickled beyond measure and when I discovered there was a novel by W.Somerset Maugham (the author of The Razor's Edge no less!) based on Gauguin, my joy knew no bounds. I was in the correct frame of mind to read about the life of a stockbroker who gave up on the trivial pleasures of bourgeois life for the penury and hard life of an aspiring painter without considering him ridiculous or vain. Supplied with the appropriate proportions of awe that is due to a genius protagonist, I began reading the book. I have to admit I expected a whole lot from it. I had a voyeuristic curiosity to delve into the head of a certified genius. I was even more curious to see how Maugham had executed it. At the same time, I was hoping that the book would raise and answer important questions concerning the nature of art and about what drives an artist to madness and greatness.The BookThe book's title is taken from a review of Of Human Bondage in which the novel's protagonist, Philip Carey, is described as\"so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet.\"I admired Maugham's narrative voice. In his inimitable style, he flits in and out of the characters' life as the stolid, immovable writer who is a mere observer, and nothing more. His narrator defies Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as in observing his characters, he doesn't change their lives or nature one bit. He has a mild disdain for the ordinary life of a householder and relishes his independence.\"I pictured their lives, troubled by no untoward adventure, honest, decent, and, by reason of these two upstanding, pleasant children, so obviously destined to carry on the normal traditions of their race and station, not without significance. They would grow old insensibly; they would see their son and daughter come to years of reason, marry in due course – the one a peretty girl, future mother of healthy children; the other a handsome, manly fellow, obviously a soldier; and at last, prosperous in their dignified retirement, beloved by their descendants, after a happy, not unuseful life, in the fullness of their age they would sink into the grave. That must be the story of innumerable couples, and the patter of life it offers has a homely grace. It reminds you of a placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vasty sea; but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indifferent, that you are troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness. Perhaps it is only a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share of the great majority, something amiss. I recognized its social value. I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course. There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights. In my heart was a desire to live more dangerously. I was not unprepared for jagged rocks and treacherous shoals if I could only have change – change and the excitement of the unforeseen.\"In Maugham's hands, Gauguin becomes Charles Strickland, an unassuming British stockbroker, with a secret unquenchable lust for beauty that he is willing to take to the end of the world, first to Paris and then to remote Tahiti. He is cold, selfish and uncompromising in this quest for beauty.\"The passion that held Strickland was a passion to create beauty. It gave him no peace. It urged him hither and thither. He was eternally a pilgrim, haunted by a divine nostalgia, and the demon within him was ruthless. There are men whose desire for truth is so great that to attain it they will shatter the very foundation of their world. Of such was Strickland, only beauty with him took the place of truth. I could only feel for him a profound compassion.\"However words such as these serve to romanticize Strickland's actions which at first glance, remain despicable.He leaves his wife as casually as one would leave to buy milk from the store, he betrays his only friend by eloping with his wife and then proceeds to drive her to suicide with his callousness.Maugham paints him as a rogue loner, an unfathomable apparition, compelled to inhuman acts by the divine tyranny of art.\"He lived more poorly than an artisan. He worked harder. He cared nothing for those things which with most people make life gracious and beautiful. He was indifferent to money. He cared nothing about fame. You cannot praise him because he resisted the temptation to make any of those compromises with the world which most of us yield to. He had no such temptation. It never entered his head that compromise was possible. He lived in Paris more lonely than an anchorite in the deserts of Thebes. He asked nothing from his fellows except that they should leave him alone. He was single-hearted in his aim, and to pursue it he was willing to sacrifice not only himself – many can do that – but others. He had a vision. Strickland was an odious man, but I still think he was a great one.\"In these beautiful words he describes Strickland's strange homelessness and suggests a reason for his subsequent escape to Tahiti.\"I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid strange surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. They are strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history. Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels he belongs. Here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scnes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. Here at last he finds rest.\"By the end of the book, Maugham's narrator somewhat loses his grip over the reader and I could picture him in my mind floundering around the island of Tahiti, interviewing the people who came in contact with Strickland, trying to piece together a story. He finds himself in the \"position of the biologist, who has to figure out from a bone, not only a creature's body, but also its habits.\"The reader is promised the ineffable, a study of genius and is only delivered an admission of its elusive nature. Also the tone of the novel tends to get slightly misogynistic in places. But I suppose that is more a failing of the protagonist rather than the author. As compensation, Maugham offers delicious crisp cookies of wisdom throughout. In simple lyrical language, he penetrates to the core of the human condition and offers invaluable advice to the aspiring writer, the hopeful lover and the wannabe genius.For its unpretentious, sympathetic and humane portrayal of a deeply flawed protagonist, its quotable quotes and its ironic humour, this book shall rank as my one of my favourite books on the life and development of an artist in search of the unknowable.My Master MaughamI strongly believe that the adjectives one throws around are a barometer of one's sensitivity or at the minimum, one's desire to be accurate. Both of these qualities are indispensable to the aspiring writer because honestly, what is there to writing exceptfresh verbs, evocative adjectives, searing honesty and an unbounded imagination.Also, that it's easier said than done.In this context, there are moments when I feel utterly stupid and unimaginative. My inner monologues resemble the chatter of teenage girls in their lack of content and use of worn-out adjectives. I mean, awesome and amazing, like seriously? Bleeuurghh!! During such exasperating times, my inner world aches to devour a mouthful of good-looking words in the Queen's English. I head to my dusty book-closet and roughly displace its contents until I find a book either by one of the barons of British literature, a W.Somerset Maugham/PG Wodehouse or a laid-back satire along the lines of Yes Minister. The book usually serves its purpose admirably. It manages to extract me from my predicament by either making me split my sides laughing or by drowning me in a stream of sentences so beautifully constructed that I completely forget my insecurities and start shaking my head ponderously at the writer's virtuosity instead.Coming to the topic of the writer himself, W.Somerset Maugham is one of my favourite writers in the English language. Being an aspiring writer who's yet to find his voice myself, his novels never fail to stab me with a hopeful optimism. My premature belief, that I can write well, is reinforced when I read Maugham. He never intimidates me or bores me, commonplace sins many writers will have to go to confession for. While reading his prose, he possesses the singular ability of making the difficult art of writing seem pretty doable. This, I've realized with the passing of time, is due to one simple reason. It is because W.Somerset Maugham never shows off! Never! Never does he ramble pointlessly. Never does he merely graze the point instead of hitting it fair and square because he was too busy fooling around with the language. Never! He hits bulls eye with eloquence and a kind of frugal, flowing lyricism. There is always a single-minded purpose behind his writings. It is to spin a mighty good yarn by getting the point across without making his readers consult a dictionary. He even propounds profundity in a manner that typically makes me re-read the paragraph(and underline it) to admire the economy and ease with which the thought was expressed in words. I find the writing styles of Hemingway and Maugham similar in form, but while Hemingway's writing is austere to the point of being skeletal, Maugham clothes his words until they can be considered passably pretty.For his remarkable abilities, Maugham's opinions about his own writing were always modest. He believed he stood\"in the very first row of the second-raters.\"Asked about his method of writing, he simplified it to a matter of keen observation and honest reproduction.\"\"Most people cannot see anything,\"he once said,\"but I can see what is in front of my nose with extreme clearness; the greatest writers can see through a brick wall. My vision is not so penetrating.\"My favourite excerptsAdvice to aspiring writers\" I forget who it was that recommended men for their soul's good to do each day two things they disliked: it was a wise man, and it is a precept that I have followed scrupulously; for every day I have got up and I have gone to bed. But there is in my nature a strain of asceticism, and I have subjected my flesh each week to a more severe mortification. I have never failed to read the Literary Supplement of The Times. It is a salutary discipline to consider the vast number of books that are written, the fair hopes with which their authors see them published, and the fate which awaits them. What chance is there that any book will make its way among that multitude? And the successful books are but the successes of a season. Heaven knows what pains the author has been at, what bitter experiences he has endured and what heartache suffered, to give some chance reader a few hours relaxation or to while away the tedium of a journey. And if I may judge from the reviews, many of these book are well and carefully written; much thought has gone to their composition; to some even has been given the anxious labour of a lifetime. The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of his thoughts; and indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.\"\"Until long habit has blunted the sensibility, there is something disconcerting to the writer in the instinct which causes him to take an interest in the singularities of human nature so absorbing that his moral sense is powerless against it. He recognizes in himself an artistic satisfaction in the contemplation of evil which a little startles him but sincerity forces him to confess that the disapproval he feels for certain actions is not nearly so strong as his curiosity in their reasons. The writer is more concerned to know than to judge.\"On the ironic humour of life\"Dirk Stroeve was one of those unlucky persons whose most sincere emotions are ridiculous.\"On the nature of art\"Why should you think that beauty, which is the most precious thing in the world, lies like a stone on the beach for the careless passer-by to pick up idly? Beauty is something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul. And when he has made it, it is not given to all to know it. To recognize it you must repeat the adventure of the artist. It is a melody he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.\""

        "user_review": "W. Somerset Maugham's Charles Strickland might not be heading onto my list of the most likeable characters in literature, but one thing is for sure, he is certainly one of the most memorable. Strickland, a bourgeois city gent living in London has a dull, soulless exterior that conceals the fact he just may be a genius. He devotes himself to himself, and hides within him a passion for painting that no one else seems to knows about. He doesn't give a stuff about anybody, including his family, and his wife is left baffled when Charles suddenly travels to Paris (and then later on Tahiti) with no intentions to ever come back. She believes he has run away with another woman, but the truth leaves her totally perplexed, after the narrator of Maugham's novel is sent after him, having only meet Strickland briefly before.Derived from the life of Paul Gauguin, our main character is a man insensible to ordinary human relations, who lives the life of pure selfishness which is sometimes supposed to produce great art, which has always had its fascination for novelists inspired only by the unusual. Accordingly there have been novels in plenty depicting the conflict of the abominable genius with the uncongenial environment, and Mr. Maugham has followed a recognised convention in this story of an imaginary artist of posthumous greatness. He treats him throughout with mock respect, and surrounds his affairs with contributory detail. Maugham's story takes a respectable man who deserts his wife after seventeen years of marriage to get fully behind a great idea - to turn himself into a famous artist, having previously had no experience. His break is succeeded by living destitute with a stubborn determination, and by long periods of work and outbursts of savage behaviour.Now, here's the thing, does Maugham convince us that Strickland is a real man and a real artist with which we can absorb his traits as part of the essential human creature who lives eternally by his work? It seems he does not. Where every detail should be pungently real, one is constantly checked in belief by the sense of a calculated and heightened effect, and by the passion of Maugham for his subject. Such a passion is sometimes defeated by it's object. Here one is repelled, not so much by Strickland's monosyllabic callousness, but by the knowledge that this callousness is seen and represented without subtlety. This does eventually change towards the end, but what I liked about Maugham's narrative is he never succumbs to the obvious temptation to seek to explain Strickland's actions to us, we are left in the dark to his motives just like the other characters. Another positive is that he uses the minor elements in the story with an extremely effective manner. There are deeper themes going on here, if you dig hard enough.The novel is one of a destructive nature, and presents a really terrible philosophy on Modernism which it propounds, but I found it compulsively readable. Maugham's writing manages to be both powerful and austere, with not a moment wasted. I particularly liked the first-person narrative voice, which captured me with a mix of admiration and disdain for Strickland, something that Maugham struck a masterful balance with."

        "user_review": "I liked the writing and the story; maybe I'm not on the right track, but I take away that everyone deep down can hope for something else, a changing total of his life. Still, it will be too excessive if he does it too late; it will be too extreme (this is happening here). This man had been taken by his passion, which undoubtedly devoured him before, but he could not express remorse for not doing so earlier. It was a form of guilt that he left behind him, hence this way of life, this violence in his relations with society and others, and a destroying state.This husband offered nothing flattering for a woman trying to find a place for herself in the world of letters and the arts. Nothing salient saved from the banality of this character is undoubtedly irreproachable but hopelessly ordinary.One day, however, the insignificant Charles Strickland abandons his wife and home, leaves for Paris, begins a career as a painter, and reveals himself to be an enigmatic, fanciful, and sometimes hurtful being.Misogynist, cruel to himself and others, he sacrifices everything to work doomed to the incomprehension of contemporaries, treating with equal contempt those who love him and those who hate him, exercising an inexplicable fascination with all.Seduced less by the artist than by the man, the author draws a portrait of this character that the banality of the surrounding characters makes even more strange.The delicacy of writing and the conciseness of exemplary anecdotes give the novel an allure of worldliness and oddity that perfectly fits the subject."

        "user_review": "Remember your first taste of beer as a kid? Sour, not sweet like a soft drink, it was hard to swallow. Still you tried. That was me reading The Moon and Sixpence. I hated Strickland, the stockbroker turned painter who deserts his wife and children to go off to Paris and Tahiti. His every word was repellent as a bubbly drink going up my nose.But something told me not to give away or sell my copy. It waited on a shelf up high. Then, today, I read it again the way you do. Dipping in here and there. And that did it. I knew why I still gave it a home.Free of caring what anyone thinks of him, Strickland is a Bartleby. He knows his life's course and will follow it. Explanations are justifications and he is not offering any. Yet, unlike Melville's \"scrivener\" whose only words are \"I would prefer not to,\" Maugham's protagonist tells us what he does prefer to do. \"I want to paint,\" he repeats. \"I've got to.\" In these words Strickland speaks for every artist whether the painter, writer, composer, or actor. He speaks for us in our compulsion to create because it is breath itself. Like Strickland, we've \"got to\" and must embrace our audacity.\"The greatness of Charles Strickland was authentic,\" Maugham decides. \"He disturbs and arrests.\" Whether successful in our lifetimes or after our deaths, artists who pursue their \"got to\" drive are an unsettling bunch. So, expect it to be an unsettling read.Strickland isn't a Shirley Valentine running off to a Greek island to escape the doldrums of life not to mention rain in Liverpool. Strickland is monstrous. I liked his Dutch friend better. But the brush goes to Strickland if I had to choose. I'd toss it like a lifeline to the drowning genius and shout \"Catch!\""

        "user_review": "I may not be able to tell a post-impressionist painter from a post hole digger, but if I see a painting by Paul Gauguin I can usually identify it correctly.W. Somerset Maugham's 1919 novel about fictional artist Charles Strickland is loosely based on the life of the French painter, but let's be honest, even though this is a novel and something of a caricature, it is the slings and arrows of Gauguin's outrageous life that make this so damn entertaining.That and Maugham's gifted writing and his deft ability to describe human emotion and to add impressionistic detail to complex relationships. Maugham's dialogue, always good, is here almost Dickensian in its narrative quality. There are several scenes that were hypnotic, drawing the reader into an exchange between two characters.Maugham introduces us to Charles Strickland, an English stockbroker who leaves his wife and children to move to Paris to learn to paint and to realize his dream, late in life, of being an artist. Told in first person observations about Strickland over the course of many years, we follow Strickland's roguish adventures to Tahiti where his mastery is recognized.But Maugham describes a complicatedly simple man who just wants to live in his work. Undesiring of money or fame, he simply wants to create and to express his artistic vision. His philosophy, appearing on the surface to be hedonistic and misanthropic, is more than an esoteric isolation from society but is an all-encompassing, passionate devotion to his work.This is not a biography of Gauguin, but more of an examination of the spirit of his life, similar to how the Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations, using symbolism and abstraction to depict its subject.For Maugham readers, art lovers and the rest of us: a good book."

        "user_review": "\"Art is a manifestation of emotion, and emotion speaks a language that all may understand.\"- W. Somerset Maugham,The Moon and SixpenceI'd only ever read one Maugham before this (\"Of Human Bondage\") but even with just that one read I could tell Maugham was a very special writer and destined to be one of my favourites. I picked up this thin book thinking it would be a quick, simple read, but I wasn't prepared for the depth and profundity in it. There is a lot going on in this little book, lots to think about.Reading the back of the book you'll know that the main character in this book, Charles Strickland, was modelled after Paul Gauguin. There's no way I would have guessed that for most of the book, until Strickland/Gauguin moved to Tahiti.Even without knowing much about Gauguin's life, this book was interesting as it took us on a tour of his life, done by a narrator who operates as an unofficial biographer, taking us through Strickland/Gauguin's life from England to Paris, and finally Tahiti.Strickland is an awful person and extremely misogynistic. It's been a while since I've read such an odious character in literature. I despised him:\"He was a man without any conception of gratitude. He had no compassion. The emotions common to most of us simply did not exist in him, and it was as absurd to blame him for not feeling them as for blaming the tiger because he is fierce and cruel.\"It was surprising to witness how the passion in Strickland seemed to remain dormant for years but eventually caused him to act like a man possessed and completely re-evaluate his life as that passion needed an outlet:\"That must be the story of innumerable couples, and the pattern of life it offers has a homely grace. It reminds you of a placid rivulet, meandering smoothly through green pastures and shaded by pleasant trees, till at last it falls into the vasty sea; but the sea is so calm, so silent, so indifferent, that you are troubled suddenly by a vague uneasiness. Perhaps it is only by a kink in my nature, strong in me even in those days, that I felt in such an existence, the share of the great majority, something amiss. I recognised its social values, I saw its ordered happiness, but a fever in my blood asked for a wilder course. There seemed to me something alarming in such easy delights. In my heart was a desire to live more dangerously. I was not unprepared for jagged rocks and treacherous shoals if I could only have change -- change and the excitement of the unforeseen.\"Gauguin comes up a lot in discussions on primitivism and orientalism, and reading up on his time in Tahiti really leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. The discussion on place and how we might be searching for a place where we are free to be really spoke to me, but Gauguin being himself meant taking child brides in the tropics, and that reminded me of the fact that Europeans had/have free reign in some parts of the world all due to their perceived power. But still, the idea that we can be perceived differently in different areas, and therefore be more suited to one area than another, is interesting:\"I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. They are strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history. Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels that he belongs. Here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. Here at last he finds rest.\"It's hard to summarize this book without bringing up the racist language. There were quite a few racial epithets which, I'm not sure spoke of Maugham's insensitivity to different races, or just that he was reflecting the language and sentiments of the time. Either way, they were shocking, and I could have done without them."

        "user_review": "W. Somerset Maugham is one of those prolific, craggy-faced British writers who seem rather irrelevant and fusty today. No one reads or discusses him anymore, and I'm sure he's not taught in schools, although he enjoyed decades of success and wrote many novels, plays, collections of short stories and – a term that perfectly captures his particular era – \"belles-lettres.\"(I think his problem was he was writing around the time modernist writing – Joyce, Faulkner – broke through. And his style is definitely not as \"innovative,\" although in some ways it has aged better.)That said, I'm glad I picked up this engrossing, compact and well-written novel. It's \"inspired\" by the life of post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, whose Tahitian works I of course have seen in galleries and reproductions.Maugham sets up the novel as if it consists of memories from an unnamed semi-autobiographical figure who's also a young novelist and playwright. (I think it's a device he also used inThe Razor's Edge, at least according to the Oscar-winning film version I've seen.)Charles Strickland is a perfectly ordinary, comfortable, middle-class 40-something London stockbroker who one day leaves his wife and children to go to Paris to become a painter. His wife, believing he's run off with another woman, asks the narrator to locate him in Paris, which he does. But instead of finding a man caught up in a torrid mid-life-crisis affair, he discovers a loathsome, hateful, irritable man living in a garret and learning how to paint. Strickland isn't the most articulate man, but he believes painting is his calling. He doesn't care about his wife, or his reputation, or even money, although he needs it to live.The narrator also meets another artist, the corpulent Dutch immigrant Dirk Stroeve, who is commercially successful but a bit of a fool. A lot of poor Parisian artists sponge off him, including Strickland. Stroeve is one of the few people, however, to recognize Strickland's genius. And he goes out of his way to help him, including opening up his apartment to the man when he falls ill; he and his wife, Blanche, help restore him to health. Not that Strickland is in any way grateful.I appreciated this novel not as a biographical portrait of Gauguin but rather as a ruthless, unromanticized look at the idea of the artist. Should it matter if an artist is brilliant but a complete and utter asshole? Strickland's calling almost seems religious, and I liked thinking about this theme as well. Maugham wasn't as experimental as his modern contemporaries, but I found his use of the narrator figure fascinating. And his writing about sex was telling, especially knowing that Maugham was a closeted gay man, which added depth and richness to his depiction of an outsider figure.Finally, the idea of someone leaving their comfortable job to pursue something more meaningful felt very timely during this moment, which has been dubbed \"The Great Resignation.\"I was all set to give the book 5 stars… until I got to the final section, which felt anti-climactic. And warning: there are some racial and cultural epithets that will seem offensive to contemporary eyes and ears. Plus it's important to keep in mind that, like Gauguin's Tahiti paintings themselves, this book – especially the final part – is deeply influenced by colonialism.One interesting note: the title never comes up in the book. Apparently it comes from a review of Maugham's earlier book,Of Human Bondage. It's about being \"so busy yearning for the moon that [you] never see the sixpence at [your] feet.\" That sentiment in itself is a thoughtful statement about art, idealism, ordinary life and commerce.This is a remarkable novel. I'm definitely going to read more Maugham."

It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.\"\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\"In addition to plenty of witty bon mots, Maugham dropped several lengthy quotes on the nature of beauty and how relative it is, especially through the eyes of the artist. Maugham's protagonist, Charles Strickland grows indifferent to pretty much everything in his life: wife, children, luxury, polite society and focuses his passions like a laser on the creation of a vision that's perceptible to pretty much only him. Few others see it, but Strickland doesn't care; he's too focused on the creative process to pay anyone any mind. He's kind of a brute, who can only articulate his inner perception on the canvas.Strickland's a complete ass, losing pretty much all sense of propriety, not caring whether he's mortally offended anyone who's willing to lend him a hand, biting that hand with a furious chomp – leaving broken lives in his wake. The further he runs from society (to Tahiti – \"a magical place\") and it's distractions, the closer he comes to being able to extract his conception of \"pure\" beauty from the dark recesses of his mind.I've known people like Strickland – talented, brilliant, corrosive – people who have that weird light surrounding themselves. Friends and family that have been taken advantage of, cheated, hurt, yet still can't shake being in the presence of this person; it's like having one foot in a tornado. The narrator, a writer, who's been offended by Strickland on numerous occasions still comes around for the proverbial bitch slap. Strickland doesn't achieve success and recognition until after he's dead, his family willing to whitewash his transgressions, something that probably wouldn't surprise or bother him.The only other Maugham I've ever read isThe Razor's Edge, that one was a passable read with the same format (first person narrative observer, main character in search of some sort of truth), but this book has a kinetic energy and spirit. You might loathe Strickland and want to throat punch him, but you still have a deep unspoken understanding of his motivations, that although you don't fully condone, you still respect his vision.Buddy Read with the artsy, occult branch of the Pantsless Legion of Indecency: Ginger, Kristin, and Stepheny."

        "user_review": "How much do we forgive a great, talented artist who is also a despicable human being? Will his admirers look the other way, thinking since he is no longer around and no more harm can be done by him, it is all right now to forgive and forget, besides he didn't do anything to their family but to other people...Shakespeare said, \"The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones\"... Englishman Charles Strickland a thinly disguised Paul Gauguin, is one of those men, selfish, cruel, disloyal an unfeeling cad you would loathe if you had ever met, nothing matters but his art, everyone else he can and does step on to reach his higher calling, being a superb painter yet nobody believes in his abilities, they see only a primitive man with the same tendencies on canvas, besides there are hundreds of better painters in Paris. Strickland had abandoned his wife and two children in London, leaving his family without any means of support if they starved he wouldn't care, nothing is really important but his destiny, set at the turn of the 20th century, Somerset Maugham does not try to hide the fact that he is the person narrating this novel. Having briefly met Strickland in London when the future legend was just another boring, ordinary, nonentity a monosyllabic stockbroker, who could guess of his later fame. Maugham is more impressed by the charming Mrs.Strickland though not pretty, she does radiate what the perfect Englishwoman should be in that era. Later the shocked lady embraces the rumors that her husband had fled with a young shopgirl to France , she could not face the truth which would be humiliating....Mr. Strickland had secretly gone because he needed to paint. In Paris living in squalor in an one room, filthy, pungent, airless apartment he ekes out a living by guiding curious Englishmen, to the sordid sections of the city that no respectable person would go, the kind of areas policemen hate foreigners to see. This or any other jobs which puts money in his hands, more so for buying things to continue painting than to eat or pay the rent, he has lost much weight to rather an unhealthy level . None buys his paintings however he doesn't care. Finally meeting a bad Dutch painter the humane Dirt Stroeve, who actually sells his mediocre paintings, short, plumb, gregarious he never takes it personally when fellow artists disparage his product. Still his English wife Blanche does, she has a checkered past and this type of woman can't forgive the man that saved her, Dirt. An ailing Strickland becomes dangerously ill, he is nursed by the generous Dutchman, the only person who perceives his genius in is own home, the reluctant wife helps, the life of this scoundrel will not end here, he pays back his huge debt by taking away his Blanche ... Maugham is now living in Paris, and becomes friends with the always kindly Dirt, writing a play there, is more upset than her husband, he will forgive if she returns... but tragedy ensues. Strickland somehow gets on a ship and after much travels arrives in the beautiful, tropical, south seas island of Tahiti...Years pass, nothing is heard about this fugitive from civilization until during WWI, Somerset Maugham at his government's request, goes to the same island that Strickland was on, there the paintings he had been indifferent to shocks his senses, the sparkling, plethora of colors, the blues, greens, yellows, reds, violets, and whites, bright, brilliant, a glorious stream of unending shades it teases the mind and makes him dizzy, this, never captured before so well on canvas...now he has seen the real Strickland."

And still it's not enough.It's my long term goal to read everything Maguham wrote, a goal that I doubt will be very difficult to reach. He writes with such poignant observation and wit and inThe Moon and Sixpencehe captures the all encompassing, obsessive and brutal nature that perhaps it takes to be an artist.Told by an unnamed narrator, we are introduced to Charles Strickland, a beastly yet seemingly ordinary man who one day leaves his wife, his children, his job and his entire life to paint. The drive to create is all there is in him, and leaving a trail of destruction he goes to Paris (don't they all?) and then to Tahiti. He is displaced, disassociated and curiously unappealing. It is a wonderful and extreme portrait of the innate need some have to follow their calling, or better still, the lack of choice they have to do so.I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid certain surroundings, but they have always a nostalgia for a home they know not. They are strangers in their birthplace,and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that send men far and wide in search for something permanent, to which they may attach themselves. (p.135)"

        "user_review": "It must be said up front that I am a huge fan of Maugham. I like his writing style, which always makes me feel as if I am sitting with a friend and he is telling me about someone he actually knows. With this conversational tone, Maugham leads you into the depths of the human soul and sometimes leaves you to find your own way out.Based very loosely on the life of Paul Gauguin, this novel is a study in how much a true artist will do for the sake of his art: not only how much he will endure, but how much he will inflict upon others. You cannot like Maugham's character, Strickland, nor, I think, can you truly understand him. Even our narrator never manages to understand the man, and he has been observing him for a lifetime. I can't help wondering how much Maugham felt that he was, himself, a man who had to follow his art at any cost. Of course, for Strickland and anyone who happens to come too close to him, the costs are extreme.One of the important questions Maugham raises in this novel is what makes up success and who gets to decide if you are successful. Is it truly about how much you acquire outwardly or how much you acquire inwardly?\"I wondered if Abraham really had made a hash of life. Is to do what you want, to live under the conditions that please you, in peace with yourself, to make a hash of life; and is it success to be an eminent surgeon with ten thousand a year and a beautiful wife? I suppose it depends on what meaning you attach to life, the claim which you acknowledge to society, and the claim of the individual.\"I think Maugham thought that we too often attach the wrong meaning to life, that we strive too often for what others tell us should be our want instead of the things that our soul cries out for in the night. None of us wishes to be Strickland. Hell, we don't even want to know Strickland, but each of us is faced with his same choice--cut our own path or follow the dictates of society--and too often we make the wrong decision."

What a talented writer!Maugham introduces us to the life of an artist, which I heard is based loosely on the artist Paul Gauguin, who in order to solely pursue his talent, he abandons everything else close to him in his life, including family, work, responsibilities. It's just him and his brush.I notice that Maugham makes him out to be some kind of impressive and a somewhat valiant character, dedicating his whole self to art, and, that it was a necessity to do so, in order to achieve that creativity. While I enjoyed the story, I won't agree with that cutting yourself off from humanity and everything else that can bring one pleasure is the way to achieve a talent such as artistry. I mean, what is the point of life if that's all there is?This was an interesting read about an obsession and a tormented man, and although I'm glad I've read it, I don't think it was Maugham's best work."

        "user_review": "Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestI'm working my way through an omnibus edition of Maugham's work, and man, he canwrite. I'm torn between the impulse to swim leisurely through his prose or just gleefully cannonball into it. Unlike some writers of this time, Maugham is not particularly flowery, but he has an interesting way of presenting ideas and constructing sentences that makes you want to read over them several times, just to appreciate their ideas and form.MOON AND SIXPENCE, which could just as easily be called \"Portrait of the Artist as a Douche,\" is based loosely off the life of the artist,Paul Gauguin.I tried to pronounce his name several times, ineffectively, ranging from gewgaw, to Google, togaijin. As it turns out, the way it's actually pronounced makes him sound like a creature from a Japanese monster movie (it rhymes with \"Rodan\"), which is only thefirstway this book surprised me.Strickland seems like he has the ideal of the moderately successful life: a wife, children, a good job with steady pay. But he is discontent, and one day, coldly decides to leave his wife and job and go to Paris, living in squalor. Why? So he can paint. The confusion of his family, neighbors, and the narrator himself is palpable. To paint? Not because of madness, or because of another woman - but just... for art? For art's sake, and not for fame?The narrator follows Strickland, as he wrecks yet another marriage, paints more art, and eventually goes to Tahiti, where he finds the climate agreeable and even obtains one of the locals as a \"wife.\" The whole time he is cruel and scornful, dismissive of others' feelings, wants, or desires, and even his own comfort. Everything must be sacrificed for art. Ultimately, I'd say this is a tragedy, because that vision ends up consuming Strickland; he pours his entire being into his art, and like many artists, it isn't until he's dead that his work becomes first a curiosity and then something far more powerful.A lot of my friends did not enjoy this book and I can certainly see why. Strickland is a jerk, and so is the narrator. There's a casually dismissive attitude towards the things that people generally consider worthy in a human being: compassion, empathy, loyalty, family, kindness, charity, etc. Art here is portrayed as something wholly selfish, and the message here seems to be that it is somehow okay; that an artist is allowed to be an egotist, because self-absorption is necessary for introspection. I don't like that message, so I can see why some people might write off MOON AND SIXPENCE as too dark and grim and irritating. However, I found myself fascinated by these terrible characters.I enjoyed this book a lot. I've read Maugham before and really liked his work, so this isn't really surprising. His other book was more of a comedy of manners, though; it was nothing like this. I'm really looking forward to working my way through his repertoire and seeing how his stories vary, while enjoying his beautiful writing and compelling, yet flawed characters.4 stars"

        "user_review": "It's a preposterous attempt to live only for yourself and by yourself. Sooner or later you'll be ill and tired and old, and then you'll crawl back into the herd. Won't you be ashamed when you feel in your heart the desire for comfort and sympathy? You're trying an impossible thing. Sooner or later the human being in you will yearn for the common bonds of humanity.I want to start with a note on the title (which does not appear in the novel). Apparently, a reviewer inThe Times Literary Supplementwrote of W. Somerset Maugham'sOf Human Bondagethat its protagonist was \"so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet\". I haven't read any other Maugham, but this must be a common theme for him (if he reused the phrase as the title of this, his next book) and this quote about yearning \"for the common bonds of humanity\" seems to hearken back to \"of human bondage\" (making me think that Maugham wanted the reader to consider these novels together and I had a pleasantly informative time googling about Maugham and his writing and Gaugin and his art.) To the review proper:Each one of us is alone in the world. He is shut in a tower of brass, and can communicate with his fellows only by signs, and the signs have no common value, so that their sense is vague and uncertain. We seek pitifully to convey to others the treasures of our heart, but they have not the power to accept them, and so we go lonely, side by side but not together, unable to know our fellows and unknown by them. We are like people living in a country whose language they know so little that, with all manner of beautiful and profound things to say, they are condemned to the banalities of the conversation manual. Their brain is seething with ideas, and they can only tell you that the umbrella of the gardener's aunt is in the house.Loosely based on the life of Paul Gaugin,The Moon and Sixpencehas a narrator (whose life experiences are broadly those of Maugham himself) who finds himself crossing the path of a misanthropic painter over the course of his hermetic and uncelebrated career. I liked that the narrator only reports known facts — his own conversations with this Charles Strickland or conversations that he had with others about the man — and I liked the irony of him saying that if this were a novel he'd imagine a childhood backstory to explain the man's prickly personality, or his apologies that he needed to invent dialogue for Strickland because so much of what the artist conveyed was in grunts and gestures. I don't know if this was a common concept in 1919, but everything about the narrator (even quoting from invented biographies of Strickland) trying to add to the body of knowledge about a genius painter who wasn't appreciated until after his death felt fresh and modern. As Strickland had left his job as a London stockbroker and abandoned his wife and children, at the age of forty, to pursue his painting, the question at the heart of this novel is: Does genius alone excuse a man for throwing off the bonds of humanity in order to pursue his passions outside the bounds of society? (As Maugham himself left his wife and child to explore the world with his gentleman companion/secretary/lover — travelling from Paris to Tahiti in the footsteps of Gaugin — he seems to be making the case for his own life as much as the painter's; when Maugham writes about \"artists\", he is obviously including himself.)Why should you think that beauty, which is the most precious thing in the world, lies like a stone on the beach for the careless passer-by to pick up idly? Beauty is something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul. And when he has made it, it is not given to all to know it. To recognize it you must repeat the adventure of the artist. It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.As much as theconceptfelt modern, the attitudes were very much of their time, with offputting racism, classism, and frequent misogyny. (It is not incidental that I wrote the question is about aman'sright to pursue his passions; Maugham [or at any rate, his narrator] does not seem to like the ladies very much.) Some representative passages:• I have always been a little disconcerted by the passion women have for behaving beautifully at the death-bed of those they love. Sometimes it seems as if they grudge the longevity which postpones their chance of an effective scene.• Women are constantly trying to commit suicide for love, but generally they take care not to succeed.• \"Women are strange little beasts,\" he said to Dr. Coutras. \"You can treat them like dogs, you can beat them till your arm aches, and still they love you.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"Of course, it is one of the most absurd illusions of Christianity that they have souls.\"(Perhaps even in 1919 the idea of Gaugin taking a thirteen year old Tahitian wife, while still married, was creepy; in this novel, Strickland's bride is seventeen. Better?) From people not understanding Strickland's painting within his lifetime (such that he was always just one step ahead of starvation) to people kicking themselves for not buying up his work cheaply when they were deemed priceless masterpieces after his death, the point can be made that the genius was always present in the work; the pursuit of truth and beauty is its own reward, separate from the opinions of others:The moral I draw is the artist should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in the release of the burden of his thought; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.Back to the title: Perhaps the true lesson is to support those who would ignore the sixpence at their feet in pursuit of the moon. This was a very compelling read (even if the racist bits were totally offputting) and I am interested in reading more from Maugham."

        "user_review": "The Moon and Sixpence(1919) was my first foray into Somerset Maugham, and I don't think I'll be hurrying back. The subject is interesting: a seemingly stolid stockbroker who breaks away from his comfortable life in his forties to become an artist, living on the breadline in Paris (and occasionally rather beneath it), before ending his days in Tahiti. I wasn't put off either by the fact that the protagonist, Charles Strickland, is an unpleasant character, devoid of all human empathy. That can be an interesting challenge, for the reader, as well as the writer.What I found off-putting in this novel was the style, which was rather leaden and ponderous, and the trite nature of its reflections on life. The unnamed narrator, an acquaintance of Strickland's, who becomes fascinated by him when he is \"discovered\" as a great artist after his death in penury, is given to pompous generalizations about art, society, and women—particularly women. There is a whole rancid florilegium of misogynistic maxims to be had in this novel, for anyone who cares for such things. Strickland's own gender philosophy is classic \"mail-order bride:\" Western women are castrating harpies and a chap can only get what he needs by looking to the simpler and healthier mores of the \"primitive\" world. Here is Strickland reflects complacently on his happy bigamous second marriage with a Tahitian teenager: \"Women are strange little beasts … You can treat them like beasts, you can beat them until your arm aches, and they still love you.\"The reflections on art and the artist are similarly underwhelming. Near the beginning of the novel, the narrator expresses his own views on the subject, which could not be much farther from my own: \"To my mind, the most interesting thing in art is the personality of the artist; and if that is singular, I am willing to forgive a thousand faults. I suppose Velasquez was a better painter than El Greco, but custom stales one's admiration for him: the Cretan, sensual and tragic, proffers the mystery of the soul like a standing sacrifice.\" The whole narrative of The Moon and Sixpence unfolds from this witlessly romantic position, with Strickland's obnoxiousness redeemed by his fiery genius, etc. etc.One intriguing aspect of the novel is the way in which Strickland's life partly maps onto Gaugin's. That was one of the things that attracted me to it in the first place. Like the thinly characterized narrator figure (who surely justisthe author), Maugham did his research, traveling to Tahiti to speak to people who knew Gaugin; yet he was careful to distinguish the final product from a fictionalized biography. \"I used only the main facts of his story,\" Maugham clarified, \"and for the rest trusted to such gifts of invention as I was fortunate enough to possess.\" Having seen the results, I might query that \"fortunate.\" Perhaps he should have stuck with the facts."

        "user_review": "I may have read a Somerset Maugham short story in some school assignment many years ago, but I've no specific recollection that I did. I know I've never read one of his novels until just now. And I might never have done so if I hadn't just read a novel by a Korean author published just twelve years ago.Thatnovel,No One Writes Back, does not parallel this one; it's not a reworking. But in the Korean novel, the protagonist wanders with just an MP3 player and a novel in his backpack. The novel, of course, is \"The Moon and Sixpence\". It was the last novel the protagonist's brother ever read, throwing it at the protagonist when he was finished. And, during his wanderings, a girl he meets takes the protagonist to a motel named . . .The Moon and Sixpence. The rooms therein don't have numbers. Instead they're named for painters. The protagonist is assigned the Edward Hopper Room.I was intrigued enough to convince myself that I probably needed to read \"The Moon and Sixpence.\" One book does indeed lead to another.All the book blurbs will tell you that \"The Moon and Sixpence\" is about a character named Charles Strickland who Maugham based not loosely on the artist Paul Gauguin. So, Maugham has Strickland leave his job in finance, leave his wife and children, and go off to paint. The fictional brilliance is creating Strickland as a character without regard for anyone who might be hurt by his actions. Or without regard for anyone, really. And Strickland's answer for those who ask is that, \"I have to paint.\"Still the connection to the Korean novel was not obvious. And maybe I forced the issue when I lingered over this passage by Maugham, trying to slide it over to the other book:We seek pitifully to convey to others the treasures of our heart, but they have not the power to accept them, and so we go lonely, side by side, unable to know our fellows and unknown by them. We are like people living in a country whose language they know so little that, with all manner of beautiful and profound things to say, they are condemned to the banalities of the conversation manual.

        "user_review": "I read this right after I read the Painted Veil. I guess I am on a Somerset Maugham kick. His characters are richly developed and yet hard to know. I imagine that he may find them and humanity that way, though he does his best in bringing you along on his journey of discovery. I am never quite sure what he thinks about women. Sometimes, such as in the Painted Veil, he finds them redeemable and then in other instances trifling and slow-witted.The Moon and Sixpence was the story based upon the painter Gaughan though referred to as Strickland and it was an examination of the mindset, passion, be it good or evil, and focus that is required in being an artist and how it can own ones soul through out. The artist was Machiavellian in his pursuit of what he knew not in his art, and in finding it, it both saved and damned him. Those who could put up with his personality were privy to a genius that was not swayed by the opinion of others but deeply committed to his art. He lived to paint and painted to live; nothing else held value.A great book. Some slow parts and i find Maugham's beginnings a bit over taxing, but like the other things I've read of him, they are thought provoking stories that slightly change your view of the world."

        "user_review": "This was a perfect follow-up to Fabrizio Dori'sGauguin, a graphic novel I reviewed earlier in the month. Maugham's short novel functioned like a prequel for me because, whereas Dori focuses on the artist Paul Gauguin's later life in the South Pacific, Maugham concentrates on his similar character Charles Strickland's attempt to make a living as a painter in Paris.The Moon and Sixpence– the unusual title comes from theTLSreviewer's description of the protagonist inOf Human Bondageas so absorbed in reaching for the moon that he doesn't notice the sixpence at his feet – is narrated by an unnamed author drawn into Strickland's orbit through his wife Amy Strickland's attendance at London literary soirées. He hasn't gotten to know the couple very well at all when he hears that Charles, a stockbroker, has abandoned his family and left for Paris to pursue painting – a hobby for which he's never previously shown any aptitude.Amy sends the narrator off to Paris to talk sense into her husband, but Charles never shows the least remorse. The narrator marvels at his insouciance and utter conviction that he is meant to be an artist.He was single-hearted in his aim, and to pursue it he was willing to sacrifice not only himself – many can do that – but others. He had a vision. Strickland was an odious man, but I still think he was a great one.I noted familiar themes fromOf Human Bondage(published in 1915, four years prior toThe Moon and Sixpence), especially the artist's struggle, nomadism and the threat of poverty. Dirk Stroeve, the talentless Dutch painter who becomes friendly with the narrator in Paris and recognizes Strickland's brilliance even as he lets the man walk all over him, reminded me of the happy-go-lucky Thorpe Athelny inBondage.At less than a third of the length of that earlier novel, though,The Moon and Sixpencestruck me as a condensed parable about genius and sacrifice.Beauty is something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul. … It was the work of a man who had delved into the hidden depths of nature and had discovered secrets. … There was something primeval there and terrible. It was not human. It brought to … mind vague recollections of black magic. It was beautiful and obscene.This is a fascinating character study, whether or not you're aware of Gauguin's life as the inspiration, and would be a great introduction to Maugham's work if you've not read him before.Originally published with images on my blog,Bookish Beck."

        "user_review": "While this was not my favorite Maugham novel, the fact that he wrote it still sets it a solid notch above a lot of other books! It's a 4 star that maybe should have been a 3, but relative to other books, this still stands out as a beautifully written novel about an awful person, and the various perspectives on him and his work.The character of Charles Strickland is based on Paul Gaugin, but pushed to extremes; leaving a steady employment as a stockbroker and a well-established family behind to devote himself to painting and eventually relocating to Tahiti, where he dies in relative obscurity, success only finding him posthumously. But while I have no idea how Gaugin was as a person, Maugham makes Strickland barely tolerable: rude, uncaring of the consequences of his actions, dismissive of other people's feelings. The only thing that matters to him is his art – which few seem to appreciate. Most people look at his painting and find them crude and strange, but a few artists immediately spot that there is something very special going on with Strickland's work. The narrator, who knew him before he left his wife and fled to Paris to work, makes a point to find other people who knew him, in an attempt to better understand him and the genius that was hiding under his ordinary and often coarse façade.This book is an interesting reflection about what we put up with and chose to forgive when it comes to talented people acting terribly. Look at any news feed in the post #metoo era, and it's not hard to find examples of that – and the struggle we face when people whose work mean a lot to us find some of their unpleasant (if not outright criminal) behavior exposed. Is all their work invalidated? Do we feel hurt enough to reject it? Or do we play a little game of selective memory and still cherish work done by people who are not great at being humans? That Dirk forgives Strickland the abominable lose he caused him because he sees that the work is bigger than both of their lives is both baffling and moving.This book doesn't clear the bar set by \"Of Human Bondage\" or \"The Razor's Edge\", but it is a fascinating little book, full of Maugham's lovely prose and his profound questions about life and people. Definitely recommended!"

        "user_review": "This novel is by far my favorite account of an artist's life in fiction.The story of Charles Strickland is based on Paul Gauguin's life. To what extent, I don't know. What I do know is that there is something infinitely irresistible about how artistry is portrayed in this novel. I love the idea that a real artist creates art because he cannot not to. That all other aspects of his life - family, money, acclaim, food even - are secondary to his desire to create. Strickland is remarkable in his drive to paint - he abandons his comfortable life, wife and children, career as a stockbroker - to do something that he feels he can't live without.What I also love aboutMoon And Sixpenceis how Maugham portrays relationships between men and women. He really makes a case that women are very much into men who treat them badly. He does so with humor, even though a bitter and puzzled humor. This is one of my favorite bits of the novel, where Strickland \"proposes\" to his Tahitian wife and an observer chimes in afterward:\"Well, Ata, he said, \"do you fancy me for a husband.\"She did not say anything, but just giggled.\"I shall beat you,\" he said, looking at her.\"How else should I know you loved me,\" she answered.Tiare broke off her narrative and addressed herself to me reflectively.\"My first husband, Captain Johnson, used to thrash me regularly. He was a man. He was handsome, six foot three, and when he was drunk there was no holding him. I would be black and blue all over for days at a time. Oh, I cried when he died. I thought I should never get over it. But it wasn't till I married George Rainey that I knew what I'd lost. You can never tell what a man is like till you live with him. I've never been so deceived in a man as I was in George Rainey. He was a fine, upstanding fellow too. He was nearly as tall as Captain Johnson, and he looked strong enough. But it was all on the surface. He never drank. He never raised his hand to me. He might have been a missionary. I made love with the officers of every ship that touched the island, and George Rainey never saw anything. At last I was disgusted with him, and I got a divorce. What was the good of a husband like that? It's a terrible thing the way some men treat women.\"I want to laugh at this quote and say that Maugham's views are outdated and plain wrong, but then I read another 5-star review ofHush, Hush, and think - Nah, things, unfortunately, have not changedthatmuch.On a bright note, I do very much want to visit Strickland's Tahiti."

        "description": "Based on the life of Paul Gauguin,The Moon and Sixpenceis W. Somerset Maugham's ode to the powerful forces behind creative genius. Charles Strickland is a staid banker, a man of wealth and privilege. He is also a man possessed of an unquenchable desire to create art. As Strickland pursues his artistic vision, he leaves London for Paris and Tahiti, and in his quest makes sacrifices that leave the lives of those closest to him in tatters. Through Maugham's sympathetic eye, Strickland's tortured and cruel soul becomes a symbol of the blessing and the curse of transcendent artistic genius, and the cost in humans' lives it sometimes demands.",

        "user_review": "Beguiling Roman à clef of French painter Paul Gauguin: An Artist's Obsessive Quest for BeautyThis rather short novel is Maugham's intriguing, thought-provoking study of the life of the painter Paul Gauguin (1848-1903), and partly his mockery of society's ready willingness to turn sinners into saints, as well as a sobering look at an artist's lifelong pursuit ofbeauty, at whatever the cost to himself or to loved ones.Gaugin was a despicable misogynist and a dreadfully negative person who left his wife and 3 kids in London in his early 40s, without a smidgen of remorse or regret and without ever contacting them again, to pursue a painter's life in Paris. He then stole another painter's wife and soon thereafter rejected her out of hand as no longer necessary, shortly after which he moved to Tahiti to paint masterpieces, and so on I'll omit for you as spoilers. Let's just say he was a destroyer of lives and relationships.Paul Gaugin, \"Where Did We Come From, What Are We Doing, Where are We Going,\" 1897I recommend this novel, especially if you favor Somerset Maugham, which I do, despite his being an old lady in temperament at times and seeming a bit of a misogynist himself:\"Women are strange little beasts... You can treat them like dogs, you can beat them till your arm aches, and still they love you.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"Of course, it is one of the most absurd illusions of Christianity that they have souls.... In the end they get you, and you are helpless in their hands. White or brown, they are all the same.\"Paul Gaugin, \"Fatata Te Miti, aka By the Sea,\" 1892.Of course, this is Maugham giving voice to Gaugin; all the same, I've seen many examples in his other works to fairly surmise him a chauvinist to females while loathing himself for being attracted to males in their stead. Notwithstanding, this is an excellent novel sur la vie dans l'art et la recherche de l'artiste et la poursuite de la beauté."

        "user_review": "Well this is one of those travel books with a double journey. On the surface Macfarlane travels across the, well dare I say the British Isles given the long established fact of an Irish independent state,although have typed that whenever I'm queuing in the post office there frequently seems to be some customer at the counter who is surprised to hear about 1922 and all that, but then I suppose we do live in a busy world and it is quite difficult to keep up to date with current affairs, almost managing to flow sequentially from the hardest to the softest parts of these islands - meaning from granite to mudflats and salt marshesrather than from the fightiest to politest where competitive courtesy reigns, though at the end he skips back to the moderately hardpurely in the geological sense since my nose was not broken there when I told the waitress that I found her chocolate cake overly sweetPeak District for reasons of his own.At the same time there is an inner journey as Macfarlane conception of wildness develops. At first he plans to visit the wildestas lacking human inhabitants rather than in the most chest thumping, jumping off buildings, cartwheeling at crossroads, type placesspots across these islands between Iceland and France, imagining finding some pristine landscapes not impacted upon by human activity at the fringes of these islands. Some of you may already be laughing at the innocence of this notion, and indeed after 126 pages he realises:\"Lying there on the drifted sand, under the white stars, I thought about how the vision of wildness with which I had begun my journeys - inhuman, northern, remote - was starting to crumble from contact with the ground itself. No such chaste land exists in Britain or Ireland, and no such myth of purity can hold. Thousands of years of human living and dying have destroyed the possibility of the pristine wild. Every islet and mountain top, every secret valley or woodland, has been visited, dwelled in, worked, or marked at some point in the past five millennia. The human and the wild cannot be partitioned\"(p127).This notion is challenged by Roger Deakin, who draws Macfarlene's attention to the micro-wild such as the rich environment of a hedgerow. For Deakin the wild, as in something unregulated by human activity, is close at hand, while for Macfarlene it is remoter and reaching it in itself is an adventure, perhaps even a pilgrimage. As the book progressed my feeling was that despite Macfarlene's words abovehumanandwildremained exclusive and opposite terms, that they were separate rather than interwoven in a complete ecosystem. Although he writes critically that\"we have come to accept a heresy of aloofness, a humanist belief in human difference\"(p203) my feeling was reading that the book itself evidenced how hard such a heresy is to abandon. Ultimately for him\"wild animals, like wild places, are invaluable to us precisely because they are not us\"(p307), which for me is to ignore the issue of their intrinsic worth in favour of assessing them on the basis of their value to humanity - which is a hallmark surely of the heresy of aloofness and belief in difference that he earlier pointed out as problematic.The wild, we might surmise, is as useful to us as the dairy cow, and therefore we ought to cherish it. Supporting this idea much of the book is taken up by testimonial about the restorative power of, to use Macfarlane's term, 'the wild' not just as a place to visit but even as something to hold as precious in the memory. And I am one of those people who does find nourishment from even the memory of certain places, ah there is a good irony in how we can't stand the world that we ourselves construct,Homo Fabercan't even serve its own best interest, but the notion is troubling since it is based, I suspect, on an implicit ideology of difference: there is something different I can escape to, or maybe I'm over critical here.Let me type that I shrug my shoulders and then I can move on to a digression which is that I suspect that my affinity with nature is the result of nurture, early inculcation via my mother's milk of one of the stories about my maternal grandfather's paternal grandfather who would collect firewood from a forest every day and so lived to a lean and sprightly old age. Still daily contact with the revitalising force of the natural world didn't prevent him from being a supporter of various far right political groups, perhaps it even encouraged him to think of the value of getting a place in the sun rather than being stuck in the shade of leafy trees. But enough digression.In any case the idea of difference persists:\"The contemporary threats to the wild were multiple, and severe. But they were also temporary. The wild prefaced us, and it will outlive us\"(p316) he writes. 'We' here are something separate from the 'wild' of which on page 127 we were inseparable, once we take a pair of draper's scissors to the fabric of the ecosystem we make a nonsense of the whole cloth. Leaving this to one side we have an idea here of the strength of this phenomena which is not human only a few pages on to be confronted with\"Wildness was here, too, a short mile south of the town in which I lived. It was set about by roads and buildings, much of it was menaced, and some of it was dying\"(p321). Macfarlene's beloved phenomena is both incredibly strong, yet incredibly vulnerable, interwoven with us, yet completely distinct from us. This confusion of the inner journey makes a nice contrast with the logic of the surface journey from hard places to soft ones and provides the book with a curious vitality, by which I mean I'd snap awake reading it on my commute thinking - hang on, that's the opposite of what he said a few pages back. It is a picture of the complexity of the human mind - fully capable of holding a mess of contradictory notions within the confines of a single skull.This is not though the surface reason for reading the book, instead that is provided by the pleasant nature writing, hawks and moors and hares and hares. The book reminded me ofThe Wild Roverwith its enjoyment of the countryside and desire to experience night walking, although Macfarlene is less bothered about sleeping in the open and, like our old dead dog, he will strip offthough she at least, perhaps not out of modesty, would keep her collar onand swim in any pool of still or sea water that he comes across (at least that's the impression he gives). Certainly a deeply felt book, certainly nicely written and engaging, even if its central premise is an awkward one - really if a wild place is one without humans then we can never know them, and on this planet is there any point at which we are not interacting with everything else?"

        "user_review": "This review originally appeared on my blog,Shoulda Coulda Woulda Books.\"When I woke in the corrie above Doo Lough that night, at some point in the small hours, the cloud had passed away, and the moon was pouring its light down on to the valley. I was thirsty, so I took my metal cup and walked to the side of the corrie and held the cup beneath the spill of one of the waterfalls. The water hit the tin and set it ringing like a bell. I drank and looked down over the dark valley. The shadows of the mountain on either side of the lough were cast over its floor in clear black shapes. The starlight fell upon the scene, old light from dead stars, and where it fell, the boulders and swells of the landscape cast dark moon-shadows, and I could see the night wind rippling over the grass of the valley, stirring into ghostly presence.\"-Chapter 9, \"Grave\"There's a process that every small human goes through. It starts when you're a baby and open your eyes to see all the freaky beings above you and when you're touched and realize what that is. From there, the work of discovering the world becomes the primary task of young childhood. That's why we as teachers now know that tactile things and real experiences are the best way for children to learn. Children don't think in the abstract for the most part, so it doesn't make sense to teach them that way. Skipping over this experiential discovery to make them little adults, and give them symbols with no idea of their meaning (don't ask them to add 2 + 2 when they don't know what 2 really is), to make them look like little adults as fast as possible, is to take away something important and foundational that may never be reclaimed. Children will probably catch up eventually as to the meaning of the number 2, but they may never, in a real way, be able to understand how to face a problem and figure it out, rather than looking away until you're forced not to. Just because you have all the feels welling up inside of you doesn't mean that you know why or what to do with them.I see the evidence of the symbolic, rather than experiential, understanding that people have of the world in a lot of national conversations, whether it is on the systemic nature of racism, trying to have a complex understanding of various Islamic societies, or, very notably, the climate change debate. There, there are just so many people who don't want to look at something that's hard to look at, and throwing facts at them, even evidence of the suffering of other beings, does absolutely nothing. It's an intellectual brick wall that has thrown up its defensiveness and learned instinct to never ever be wrong in public so high that there's no scaling it. (Yes, as I hear some of you saying, even when it is disingenuously supporting something for money- there's nothing more angry or defensive or willing to deny it than someone who is in the wrong and knows it.)This is why I think Robert MacFarlane's writing, and in particular what he does with The Wild Places, is such a powerful thing to read. Because he doesn't, despite all temptation, despite all reasons to do so, go for the facts-and-evidence-and-sanity-and-rage that we've seen from so many understandably desperate liberal pundits and leaders. Instead, he tries to slip underneath our childhood defenses in another way- with sheer beauty.The Wild Places is, above everything, a catalogue. It is an attempt to create, as he tells us early on in the collection, a different kind of map, of the sort of \"wild places\" that are left in the British Isles. Every chapter focuses on a different land feature- island, valley, cape, moor, forest, holloway, storm-beach, summit, tor- and MacFarlane's experience exploring it during one year, thus not only experiencing all the different topographical features on offer, but also all the different seasons and weathers and populations one might find there.The book is, as others have mentioned, somewhat formulaic. But what a formula. He tends to open with a lovely set-piece of wherever he's visiting now, woven through with poetic imagery and an enviable naturalist's vocabulary that makes you long to look up every lovely word. He then moves to a diary-like description of everything he did in this location, interspersed with either a personal memory or a literary reflection of someone else who has walked here before. We'll get an acknowledgement of environmental degradation or climate change, delivered in a mostly matter of fact fashion. And he'll close it out by waxing poetic again, in a quiet sort of way, as if he's waving goodbye to each place for the last time.It's a formula that works very well for what he's trying to do here, which is to get people to experience what he experiences. It is an enthusiast's work like any enthusiast's work, but with a real purpose behind it. He wants to take us to the mountain top with him to let us know what it is like there. That is his best argument about why these places should be saved.And he chooses absolutely gorgeous, wonder-filled, chill-inducing, amazing places to make this argument. He sleeps on an island of rock on a \"storm-beach\". He spends a night on Enlli, an island formerly occupied by retreating monks of the middle ages and now only birds. He visits the Burrens, a layered grave yard of thousands of years of Irish dead. He walks holloways that still haven't been cleared away in Essex and rappels himself into Coruisk, perhaps the largest \"secret garden\" of a valley to be found in the islands. Each place is gorgeous in its uniqueness and some, depending on your taste in wildness, are unforgettable. Rannoch Moor and the Black Wood that lie just to the east of it were places that spoke to my deep places of myth, story and memory.He wants to make sure that we understand what we are losing when we lose these wild places. In lieu of being able to lead us on actual experiences, he tries to get us to imagine them into being as much as possible. And because we are eternally self-centered, he tries, like we all must do, to point out how wild places affect people in material ways (as he seems aware, pointing out their beauty, mystery and thought-changing capacities will not be enough).His (oft-repeated, I must admit) major realizations that he comes to over the course of the year are lovely, and if a bit trite, are none the less full of truth. Wild places, he finds, are useful to us because they offer us a place to think and be differently, literally without the boundaries that divide us in the human created and maintained world. Wild places are, truly, probably not entirely \"wild\", but filled with a history that is fascinating and layered and heartbreaking if we only knew how to look for it (and the heartbreak is just as much human as animal- just wait for his chapters on the Scottish Clearances and the Famine cottages). Wild places remind us of the truly communal nature of the world- touching things and feeling the reality of them is important for us to stay connected to our role as a member of not only the human race, but our planet as a whole. And, of course, \"wild\" places can be found everywhere, as he eventually figures out for himself- just look out your front door. Some of these truths, out of context, are precious. In context, they seem just the inevitable result of his journey:\"The blinding of the stars is only one aspect of this retreat from the real. In so many ways, there has been a prising away of life from place, an abstraction of experience into different kinds of touchlessness. We experience, as no historical period has before, disembodiment and dematerialization. The almost infinite connectivity of technological world, for all the benefits that it has brought, has exacted a toll in the coin of contact. We have in many ways forgotten what the world feels like. And so new maladies of the soul have emerged, unhappinesses which are complicated products of the distance we have set between ourselves and the world. We have come increasingly to forget that our minds are shaped by the bodily experience of being in the world- its spaces, textures, sounds, smells and habits- as well as by genetic traits we inherit and ideologies we absorb. A constant and formidably defining exchange occurs between the physical forms of the world around us and the cast of our inner world of imagination. The feel of a hot dry wind on the face, the smell of a distant rain carried as a scent stream in the air, the touch of a bird's sharp foot on one's outstretched palm: such encounters shape our beings and our imaginations in ways which are beyond analysis, but also beyond doubt. There is something uncomplicatedly true in the sensation of laying hands upon sun-warmed rock, or watching a dense mutating flock of birds, or seeing snow fall irrefutably upon one's upturned palm.\"It is also one of the few positive examples I've seen of what can be accomplished by harnessing the power of national myth and national imagination to your own purposes. We all know the pastoral national self-image of English identity, no? It's in all our fairy tale books (especially the sanitized ones): friendly meadows and streams where flocks of cows and sheep grow strong, and butterflies, cowslips and grasshoppers delight children in an eternal summer afternoon of Beatrix Potter characters. MacFarlane, scholar of the Romantic literature that helped to solidify this national self-understanding, does a great job turning this to his own purposes. Whenever he can make a connection to it, he reminds readers of all the connection's Britain's great writers and artists have had to the woods- Coleridge, Wordsworth, Edward Thomas, scientists and passionate little-knowns are all deputized to the task. He brings in WWI, and the conscious falling-in-love people did with this idea of traditional England after their time in the trenches. He goes to emotionally resonant places like the tor, where Arthur may rise again, to places of childish mystery like the holloways of the fairies and the deepwood. He evokes the Wild Hunt, and shows the marks of history all over the landscape, Scottish, Irish and Lake District. (The fact of its use is actually vaguely sinister, which I would not have thought of before I read about Helen MacDonald grappling with that fact in H is for Hawk: that is, that the nature that she loved was so frequently co-opted by the worst nationalists and that she might be taken to support them. MacFarlane does not reckon with this, and in his soft-pedaled version, perhaps he does not need to, but it is worth mentioning all the same.)There are some flaws, however, as admirable I find it in its goals and its chosen style of execution, however many lovely images I re-read or felt the urge to underline. As I mentioned, it is rather formulaic, which can sometimes get tiresome when you want the formula to lead to the next thing. He also becomes repetitive- the same insights he comes to at the end of one chapter is repeated several times over (however lovely it is), rather than that insight leading him to a new insight and furthering his thought. In addition, while I admired for the most part that he didn't define every naturalists' term that he used for us, I think that a glossary in the back of the book would have helped readers who just didn't have his knowledge of rocks and trees and birds and landforms. There were some pages whose meaning was entirely lost to me because the words themselves were lost to me (something, by the way, it seems that he also realized, given his latest book, Landmarks). And finally, the parts in each chapter where he recounts his own actual journey could be rather prosaic- I did fall asleep a few times while reading this.However, I believe that if it is read in the proper fashion (which to me means reading one or two essays a day, rather than trying to push oneself through it like I did), a lot of these flaws are likely to bother you much less. I think this would make excellent before-bed reading, commuting reading, read-outside-in-a-hammock reading, or reading for a family vacation when you're never sure how much time you'll have to read. It is an ideal book to retreat into for an hour and then put down again and feel refreshed and restored. Beauty can be enough to change us- MacFarlane is the proof."

        "user_review": "Simply lovely. A beautiful, lyrical meditation on wildness and whether or not wild places still exist in the U.K. The themes that flow through MacFarlane's writing – friendship, life, death, the past, present and future of our species and our relationship with our surroundings – feel like a layered extension of the landscapes he observes so keenly. They ebb and flow through the chapters as much (and in much the same way) as the weather, seasons, water, and migrating birds he describes. He references this in the closing chapter (p. 314):\"My journeys had revealed to me new logics of connection...A webbing of story and memory joined up my places, as well as other more material affinities. The connections made by all of these forces – rocks, creatures, weathers, people – had laid new patterns upon the country, as though it had been swilled in a developing fluid, and unexpected images had emerged, ghostly figures showing through the mesh of roads and cities.\"His growing realization that wildness is to be found even in the smallest of spaces is a powerful one, but I wish he'd acknowledged that thereisa big difference between the wild to be found in a hedgerow vs. the solitude of a vast, empty moor. However much we can and ought to heighten our appreciation for the former, humansneedthe latter.A few other notes:-As with other travel books, my enjoyment was heightened by following his travels via Google Earth.- Macfarlane is himself a well-read fan of the travel/nature writing genre and the book includes a carefully selected reading list - I've already added several of his suggestions to my to-read shelf.Definitely going to read his other volumes, although I might save them for a wintry night later this year."

        "user_review": "In seinem zweiten Buch erzählt der preisgekrönte britische Sachbuchautor Robert Macfarlane von seinen Reisen in die letzten echten Wildernisse Großbritanniens und Irlands. Dabei durchläuft er sämtliche Landschaftsformen Großbritanniens, nach denen das Buch auch in Kapitel unterteilt ist, etwa Buchenwald, Moor, Flussmündung, Gipfel oder Salzmarsch. Erwartungsgemäß sind die meisten dieser Orte in Schottland und Nordengland zu finden, doch auch der Süden ist nicht frei von Orten, an denen sich die Natur frei entfalten kann, auch wenn sie teilweise nicht sehr weitläufig sind: Schon eine Hecke in einem in Ruhe gelassenen Waldstück kann eine Wildnis sein.Robert Macfarlane ist tatsächlich ein echter Naturbursche, ich muss gestehen, dass ich selbst, die ich mich als Naturfreundin bezeichne, niemals so nahe an der Natur sein könnte wie er. Zu jeder Jahreszeit springt er zum Schwimmen ins Wasser, wo immer es welches gibt. Er übernachtet im Freien, auch im Regen, errichtet sich ein Biwak an vermeintlich unwirtlichen Stellen, wenn sie nur ein wenig Schutz bieten. Daran musste ich gestern denken, als ich eine Wanderung entlang beeindruckender Felsen im Kirkeler Wald machte – die Felsüberhänge dort wären für Macfarlane wahrscheinlich perfekte Biwakplätze, während es mich bei der Vorstellung grauste – mit allzu viel Schmutz und Insekten möchte ich dann doch keinen direkten Kontakt. Das zeigt mir, wie recht Macfarlane hat, wir haben unsere Verbindung zur Natur größtenteils verloren.\"We have in many ways forgotten what the world feels like. And so new maladies of the soul have emerged, unhappinesses which are complicated products of the distance we have set between ourselves and the world.\" (Seite 203)Auch wenn die Verbindung zur Natur bei Macfarlane sicher sehr eng ist, macht auch er negative Erfahrungen, so fühlt er sich in der auf einem Berggipfel verbrachten Nacht unwillkommen.Eine Rolle spielt in \"The Wild Places\" auch die Freundschaft mit Roger Deakin, der ebenfalls ein auf die Natur spezialisierter Autor war und leider noch während Macfarlanes Reisen für das Buch verstarb, das Buch ist ihm gewidmet.Was Macfarlanes Buch zu einem besonderen unter den Naturbüchern macht, ist die Kraft seiner Sprache, die eine magische Faszination auf die Leserin ausübt, Sätze wie \"I could feel a silence that reached backwards to the Ice Age.\" (Seite 60) etwa oder \"We stood blinking, wringing the light from our eyes.\" (Seite 233)Diese Sprache in Verbindung mit faszinierenden Naturerlebnissen macht das Buch so lesenswert und weckte in mir den Wunsch, auch alle anderen Bücher von Robert Macfarlane zu lesen.Und besonders kommt die Sprache zur Geltung, wenn es darum geht, dass der Mensch die Natur um seiner selbst willen schützen muss, wir sind es schließlich, die von der Natur abhängig sind.\"The contemporary threats to the wild were multiple, and severe. But they were also temporary. The wild prefaced us, and it will outlive us. Human culture will pass, given time, of which there is a sufficiency. The ivy will snake back and unrig our flats and terraces, as it scattered the Roman villas. The sand will drift into our business parks, as it drifted into the brochs of the Iron Age. Our roads will lapse into the land.\" (Seite 317)"

        "user_review": "In The Wild Places, Robert MacFarlane sets out to find if there are any such environments left within the British Isles. The book begins contemplatively, with the author journeying to one of his favourite local places, a beech wood outside the city of Cambridge where he lives, climbing a tree as is his wont, so he can sit and observe, and be part of, this sylvan idyll.This sets the tone wonderfully. From the very first sentence, you realise that you are in for a special experience; the quality of MacFarlane's prose is quietly spectacular, largely understated but with the rhythms of good poetry and this, combined with his eye for detail and a mind that connects the landscape and the animals and our inhabitation along with more personal experiences, make the book extraordinary.Over fifteen chapters MacFarlane travels across Britain, and to Ireland, to experience the places he considers most \"wild\" and natural, initially using as a guide the travels of the legendary Irish King Sweeney, who was made to wander the wild places as a beast following an act of betrayal.From the island of Ynys Enlii, off the Lleyn Peninsula, where Wales reaches it most Western point toward Ireland, on to Scotland - to Coriusk on Skye, Rannoch Moor, Coille Dubh ( The Black Wood ), Strathnaver and Ben Klibreck, Cape Wrath and Ben Hope before crossing the Irish Sea to the desolation of the Burren. MacFarlane finds even more poetry in these places than their evocative names suggest - along with the rest of his journey, to the high ridges of the Lakeland fells, the Kentish Holloways, the storm-lashed beaches of Norfolk, Essex saltmarshes and, finally, my own back yard, the moors above Hope Valley in the High Peak. His writing conjures the landscape like nobody I've read, the individual feel and sense and rhythm of each place, drawing the reader to it - even when, as in attempting to spend the night on the frozen Ben Hope in Northern Scotland, for the first time he feels how truly hostile a place can be and is genuinely afraid.Each section of travelogue is also woven through with skeins of history - both of the regions, and more personal history. This becomes more pointed when MacFarlane's friend Roger, with whom he has discussed many of his trips, have shared ideas and thoughts like the oldest of friends, who has accompanied him on several excursions, falls suddenly ill.The final trip to the Peak District brings the book full circle, as he is shown where to find snow hares by John, who had piloted the boat out to Ynys Enlii, and then a final coda where MacFarlane returns once more to the beech wood. He may have found that there is, perhaps, no true wilderness in the British Isles, in that there is no land that has not been shaped by humanity and our works, but that the wild is still there to be appreciated and respected, should we wish to look for it, that we need to protect it for our own health and benefit, but it the wild places will be there long after we have gone.5/5, and an instant addition to the Favourites shelf"

I've never wanted to travel to Britain as much as I do now. Macfarlane goes to natural places that are astounding. His writing is beautiful.It took me longer than expected to read this, because I spent as much time in Google Earth as in the book. And that is my suggestion: a companion volume or new edition with photos and maps, with distances. I was trolling youtube, also, and found some marvelous videos of where Macfarlane visited."

        "user_review": "I expected to read this in bits and pieces over a period of months but instead, I enjoyed it so much that I read it straight through, with the occasional stop for wikipedia look-ups of places and vocabulary.This book is classified nature/travel. It is Macfarlane's story of his search through the British Isles for \"wild places\", where nature is not disturbed or influenced by man. He doubts he will find any so his search starts on the tops of Highland mountains and on the remote islands of the coast. But then, he comes to realize (partially from his friendship with nature writer, Roger Deakin) that wildness still exists in micro bits in hedgerows, holloways, forest remnants and salt marshes of the more populated areas, too.He brings so many stories into the book -- from fellow literary folks, from scientists & naturalists, artists and poets. Book is really more about the landscape than about nature & man's mark on the landscape is everywhere, even in remote places where the Highland clearances and Irish potato famines have left the land almost barren of people in modern times. He calls it \"wildness as it is lived with humans\".I envy him the tromping around, the nights spent outside (although I can't imagine sleeping outside, without even a tent, in sub-freezing winds and rains), the views of moon and stars.The book has a charming, whimsically drawn map but I really needed something more practical, that I could more easily follow his trips. I have spent much of my reading life in the British Isles but still not familiar with its geography and need more practical help with place names. A few months ago I read Paul Theroux's A Kingdom by the Sea with a British atlas in my lap so that had helped get a few places in my head already.I now want to read more by Macfarlane and something by his good friend, Roger Deakin. And I realize that I've never read John Muir on the American landscape. I can even see re-reading this book again, just to savor his descriptions of the trees, birds, and history of the land. Lovely book."

        "user_review": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this book - I'm not normally a big fan of nature books or TV programmes - more my husband's area of interest. In fact I had bought this book for him to read, but was intrigued by it and started reading it. Then I was gripped and didn't want to put it down!It has made me think a lot about how we live our lives - often too busy to notice the world around us - always in the car rushing from place to place with no time just to sit and look, listen and absorb what we see. But when we do have time, it is always a pleasure - for example noticing a hawk hovering over a field.The book begins with MacFarlane having a particular idea about what wild places should be - vast open spaces, snow-covered mountains, moorlands, unpopulated islands etc. Gradually his ideas are modified through conversations and trips with various friends and he comes to see that wild places can be found anywhere - in towns, cities and many small spaces - a buddleia growing out of a wall, moss growing in a pavement crack, observing animals, birds in flight. All things, in fact, that produce a sense of awe and wonder at our world.I found it a fascinating book, both on a level of personal discovery, realising the true nature of what is a wild place, and in opening the readers' minds to what exists within our own island(s). It has made me want to get out and discover more about my own part of the country."

        "user_review": "There is a great review of this book by Kathleen Jamie entitled 'The Lone Enraptured Male' and for the most part I completely agree with this review and it's handle.\"Wild is a word like 'soul'. Such a thing may not exist, but we want it, and we know what we mean when we talk about it.\" she writes ....so I guess that's it, that the concept of wild is perhaps a bit fluid and maybe that is why I was hugely disappointed by this book.I loved some of the beautiful prose in this book but essentially it is a privileged male's musings whilst he sleeps outside in a bivvy. All fine, as I said some lovely writing and some interesting information - but for me, this is categorically not a book about Wild Places, let alone a book that even attempts to answer the question on the back of the book 'are there any wild places left in Britain and Ireland?'He basically goes on to have a revelation that the 'wild' for him isn't just far flung barren places but also the fields and meadows of England....Nope sorry not for me. Intensely farmed agricultural land is NOT wild. Perhaps in the same way my idea of the wild seems rather quaint to those who climb Everest or take 2 day hikes across Yosemite.I also found it interesting reading this book in the context of today whereby there is the question of 'wildness' as an invention of colonialism ...what is wild to some is not wild to Gaelic crofters, Native Americans, aboriginal or indigenous peoples.I had a few other issues with this book too...Nothing is worse than a book that just quotes from or writes about OTHER BOOKS that the author has read. There was alot of this.As Jamie writes:\"It's a book about books: as much about the literature and reception of wild places as about the places themselves. To create texture and interest and avoid a constant look-at-me-swimming, it is full of digressions, explorations and asides which hugely enrich its texture\" ...although I don't know if they DO enrich its texture to be honestFor me whole chapters went off on weird tangents and I am so sick of the same tid bits in every book I read about Scotland; Highland Clearances, Orwell on Jura....yawn... It's like a checklist sometimes. There is more to Scotland than this. One of the best bits of the book is where McFarlane meets and goes fishing with a local. Now thiss enriches the books texture.Having said all this, there are some sections I found truly interesting (chapters on the Holloway and Sand Dunes for instance as I know little of them) and it is a fairly enjoyable book. The author's friendship with Roger Deakin is told very movingly.But overall this totally missed the mark for me, it's not about the wild. I would have enjoyed it much more if it had been a small pamphlet about MacFarlane's experiences - even if parts are a bit boy scouts."

        "user_review": "A book written with inescapable beauty and one that has spoken to me. The Wild Places thrums with the life of our amazing world. Anyone who reads Robert's books will be deeply bewitched by the richness of his writing and manner. He is by far one of my most treasured nature writers.Something awoke in my soul reading page after page about the overwhelming landscapes of our archipelago and his attempts at sleeping in the wild. Ancient mountains, great valleys and nature as it's raw, all encompassing self. I feel myself constantly called to the wild and this book has helped ignite that love of exploring new ground. Tremendously poetic and sensory. Robert's exploration takes us far and wide, from Cumbria to the farthest corners of Scotland. His friendship and adventures with the late writer and environmentalist Roger Deakin was very moving. I think it speaks volumes when there is a shared love of the planet and all its mysteries. It'sinnately spiritual and wonderful the way our energies connect with the natural world. I feel so small yet full of aching wonder."

        "user_review": "A beautiful book, recounting the author's journeys through some of Britain's wild places, sometimes alone, and sometimes accompanied by one or two close friends who share his love of the wild. The language of the book is spell-binding, taking the reader on a parallel journey, weaving science and literature, knowledge and wonder. .\"From the bottom of the hill, I could hear the noise of the trees with the wind; a marine roar that grew in volume as I approached. Looking up at the swaying wood, I remembered something that I had read: when you see a wood or a forest, you must imagine the ground almost as a mirror line, because a tree's subterranean root system can spread nearly as widely as its aerial crown. For the visible canopy of each tree you have to imagine an inverted hidden one, yearning for water just as its twin yearns for light.\"\"Once, emerging from a high-hedged lane, I put up a flock of white doves from a brown field, and watched as they rose applauding into the sky.\"\"Lines of spider's silk criss-crossed the air in their scores, and light ran like drops of bright liquid down them when we moved. In the windless warm air, groups of black flies bobbed and weaved, each dancing around a set point, like vibrating atoms held in a matrix. I had the sense of being in the nave of a church: the joined vaulting of the trees above, the stone sides of the cutting which were cold when I laid a hand against them, the spindles of sunlight, the incantations of the flies.\"\"Coleridge once compared walking at night in his part of the Lake District to a newly blind man feeling the face of a child: the same loving attention, the same deduction by form and shape, the same familiar unfamiliarity. At night, new orders of connection assert themselves: sonic, olfactory, tactile. The sensorium is transformed. Associations swarm out of the darkness. You become even more aware of landscape as a medley of effects, a mingling of geology, memory, movement, life. The landforms remain, but they exist as presences: inferred, less substantial, more powerful. You inhabit a new topology. Out at night, you not only understand that wildness is not only a permanent property of land – it is also a quality which can settle on a place, with a snowfall, or with the close of day.\"Read, and find yourself wanting to begin your own journey."

        "user_review": "As a boy, I spent many hours in treetops enjoying the lofty view and the change in perspective from the ground. MacFarlane opens his book with a treetop perspective also before heading out on his peregrinations that take him to the edges of Britain in search of wildness (which he certainly finds). His most profound discovery, however, is that wildness exists all around us if we just take the time to really look and see. Humanity's grip of this planet is tenuous at best - nature is always forcing itself back in and taking over as he discovered in the emptied glens of Scotland where entire villages were no more than heaps of overgrown rock and Irish dwellings abandoned by those fleeing the famine as extreme examples, or by cracked pavement where weeds spring up in our urban landscape.While tracing his footsteps is not for the faint of heart (sleeping out on a mountain top in the midst of a Scottish winter), we can learn from his experience to look with fresh eyes at the natural world around us and appreciate it all the more for the wonder that it is. It is a very pleasant read with carefully crafted wording that rewards a slow read and an attentive mind - not unlike his rambling journeys."

        "user_review": "Essentially this book is a travelogue in which the author explores various parts of the UK that he considers to be \"wild\". The book is split into chapters, each one depicting a different type of locale - beach, mountain summit, forest, etc.I'm not really au fait with the travelogue genre so I didn't know what to expect with this one, but I found it to be a charming read. MacFarlane has a genuine warmth and enthusiasm for his subject matter that readily transfers to the reader so that they're caught up in the journey.It's an educational ride; in each section the author goes off on various tangents, introducing various 20th century figures who all championed their own wildernesses for various reasons. He also brings in some facts and figures, also some science here and there which I wasn't too keen on.For the most part, though, this book charts the author's experiences as he visits various remote locations. His descriptions are evocative and compelling, emphasising the visual as you'd expect but also including sounds and textures. This is a labour of love that brings such places to life and an intimate sharing of one man's passion for untamed nature."

The wonderful thing about Macfarlane is that he doesn't travel to the farthest corners to do it: he attempts to discover the rich and wild life beating under his nose, and this book is an account of his travels around the British Isles, thought to be all nicely fenced in and organized.Macfarlane takes us along as he climbs rocks and finds storm beaches considered useless to people due to their inaccessibility, and demonstrates that these are the places we can feel most alive. His prose is more than up to the task, as every page is full of thick and chewy Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, which really serves to bring the wild as close as possible.The best book I've read all year."

        "user_review": "From a favourite perch at the top of a beech tree, in a small wood at the edge of the city of Cambridge, Macfarlane would survey the city and neighbouring fields, and feel a familiar ache to find truly wild places, where evidence of human presence was absent. The growth of civilisation, of course, means necessarily that truly wild places are ever decreasing, and he worried that there would be no such places left in Britain. I confess I shared his sceptisicm: as a native of Canada, a land where remote, uninhabitable wilderness outpaces civilisation on a laughable scale, I wasn't sure there could possibly be a place on this small island country that humanity hadn't at some point touched. But I also feel the call of wildness so was keen to explore this resulting book-map: like Macfarlane, I am keen to find the places of escape; where the natural world threatens to overwhelm me by its untameable otherness.In just a year, one cycle of seasons, Macfarlane traverses an astonishing breadth of landscapes in Britain and Ireland. Each gentle chapter recounts the story of a particular trip to a particular wild place - island, valley, moor, summit, ridge, holloway, forest, and many more - weaving prosaic observations and experiences with thoughtful ruminations on what it means to be a human in a wild world. Unexpected excursus into scientific explanations on how the eye works, or the nature of sunlight, or the physics of the wave enrich each experience. A lesser writer's use of metaphor or anthropomorphism often feels gauche; when Macfarlane mentions clusters of magpies joking in treetops, willows leaning out over the road trailing fingertips over passing cars, or a flock of doves applauding into the dawn, he manages to evoke his own developing awareness of the porous boundary between human and non-human; or further, to perhaps suggest a kinship of all living things.In one fairly recent solitary camping trip, I pitched my tent just around the backside of a hill, barely out of sight of the car park; wanting both the experience of wildness but having far too much caution to get myself into any situation from which I couldn't easily extricate myself. I think my favourite parts of Macfarlane's tales were the descriptions of the places he slept (no tent - just a light bivvy bag!): on a tiny island cut off from the mainland by the tides, on the summit of the most northerly mountain in Britain in the dead of winter, on the iced surface of a frozen tarn (mountain lake), in sand dunes just above the tidal lines, in hedgerows, fields, meadows.Even the histories of the Scottish Clearances and the Irish Potato Famine bear witness to Macfarlane's realisation that even the most remote wildness is saturated with evidence of human presence, even if in story or memory of what is long past. His chronicles, too, are saturated with the writings, poetry, and memories of other wanderers, and I am glad for the extensive suggested reading list that concludes this book. I hope the next time I read this book it will be by the light of the moon, tucked into a dune or on a bed of mountaintop moss.ALSO: I found this book resonant with deeply theological themes but as Macfarlane is not (to my knowledge) a Christian, it seemed a bit of a Jesus juke to draw some theology from this. I'm probably wrong; but developing Macfarlane's natural theology is certainly beyond the scope of this review."

I had learned to see another type of wildness, to which I had once been blind: the wildness of natural life, the sheer force of ongoing organic existence, vigorous and chaotic. This wildness was not about asperity, but about luxuriance, vitality, fun. [...] It was something most people forgot as they grew into adults.\"I think Robert Macfarlane's books are the ones I've needed and benefited from the most throughout this past year. They've rekindled an absolute love of the world, despite me feeling so far or shut off from accessing it. His writing evokes such a deep and unique yearning to escape that no other book has, and makes me realise how vast and explorable this country is.It also makes me realise, or helps to remind me in a way that's both humbling and terrifying, that the world is older than humanity. That there will come a time when we fade from dominance, and nature will reclaim what we once controlled.\"... our age will pass, and our material legacy [...] will be absorbed by the land, becoming all but imperceptible.\"This was really emotional given the context of RM's friendship with Roger Deakin (whose books I'll be seeking out some point in the future).There's another brilliant quote that he mentions, although he also said he'd lost the source.\"Landscape was here long before we were even dreamed. It watched us arrive.\"The implication that \"it will watch us leave\" is haunting to me, in a way that I can't decide whether it's good or bad. I think it's mostly good. I remembered it when I was standing alone in the mountains last weekend. That was nothing compared to RM's experience on Ben Hope (which kept me awake after I put the book down for the night...)It's a kind of smallness that we can lose sight of, but we shouldn't. That the natural world can be both indifferently hostile and gently passive to our existence... they're both necessary to know.I'm gushing now, so this is a sensible place to stop.Brilliant, as always."

(I recognize that Macfarlane is well known in Britain, but I had never heard of him until I read a review of two of his newest books; the review suggested starting with one of Macfarlane's earlier works, so I heeded that advice and choseThe Wild Places, an account of Macfarlane's trips to some of the last vestiges of the natural world in Britain. The book instantly became one of my favorite natural history books; it's a winner. One of the recurrent themes in this book is the complementary value of paper maps and (what Macfarlane calls ) story maps; this book is a story map. Though there is a rudimentary map of the places Macfarlane visited at the beginning, I followed Macfarlane's peregrinations with an extraordinarily detailed British road atlas at my side. If you don't know the geography of the British Isles like the back of your hand, a detailed map or atlas of Britain will enhance your appreciation."

Throughout his journeys--to some of the hottest, coldest, and most desolate places on the globe--and via friendships he forges along the way with scientists, archaeologists, artists and local residents, Lopez searches for meaning and purpose in a broken world.Horizon is a revelatory, epic work that voices concern and frustration along with humanity and hope--a book that makes you see the world differently, and that is the crowning achievement by one of America's great thinkers and most humane voices.",

        "user_review": "My recurring thought while reading: How can I be the next Barry Lopez? To travel to remote places, to deeply immerse myself in local understandings of a place, to be invited on Antarctic expeditions and archaeological fieldwork sites in Kenya. To be this widely curious and well-read, to reach the depth of reflection witnessed herein and then to communicate it lucidly. If I may send some wishes out into the universe, I am tempted to start here.And another one: Why do these books always seem to be written by white men? Barry Lopez, Wade Davis, David Quammen, Robert Macfarlane... When Lopez steps off a river barge in rural China and opts for the dank, unlit stairwell, I think - maybe that path is not as safe for the likes of me. But it also strikes me as an excuse, and if anyone knows of a female author of this style and breadth, do share. Is it the publishing industry, is it the world, is it... anyway, let's change that.The wandering meditations of a modern-day elder, this tome may not be for everyone, but it was for me. One to savour slowly."

        "user_review": "\"It is every person's moral imperative to read this book\"--Hannah Greendale, Goodreads reviewerI agree.My academic mentor, Jay Robinson, gave me Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams in the late eighties. He knew I was interested in environmental studies, but I was a student of literacy learning, the teaching of English. What does such a book have to do with English studies? The answer is: Everything. Language, social justice, democracy, the future of the planet, linking Western \"development\" to ethnocentrism and colonialism. As with his Of Wolves and Men, Lopez tries to get us to do that simple indigenous injunction: Walk a mile in someone else's moccasins. Or ignore cultural and epistemological and spiritual differences to your peril. One chapter focuses on indigenous versus \"southerner\" (white) maps of the region. How do locals see and value their own land?Horizon was published in 2019; I knew it to be Lopez's magnum opus, so I set out to slow read it, even as the world burned. Lopez (RIP, 12/25/20) was both a \"nature\" journalist--plumbing the relationship between human culture and landscape--and a fiction writer, invited by countless scientific groups to accompany them on travels. Horizon has many facets; it is a deeply personal memoir--\"We, all of us, look back over our lives, trying to make sense of what happened, to see what enduring threads might be there\"--and a chronicle of his travels to six regions of the world: from Western Oregon to the High Arctic; from the Galápagos to the Kenyan desert; from Botany Bay in Australia to the ice shelves of Antarctica.\"To travel, after all, is to change one's skin\"--Antoine de Saint-Exupery\"I tried to get out of myself, to enter the country\"--Barry Lopez\"The young man [Lopez] visiting the archeological site on Skraeling Island is the same fellow who at the end of the book encounters a stranger on the road to Port Famine, but also not.\"Lopez over his life traveled to more than seventy countries, but in this book takes us to the farthest and most \"desolate\" reaches of the world, where few of us will ever go. And his guides along the way are explorers of the past of whom many of us know, and have been his inspiration: Darwin, Shackleton, Perry, Captain Cook, Ranald MacDonald--couriers of the marvelous, the thrilling, of understanding the world. Explorers of the past, the present, the future, most of them problematic for various reasons, too. This book is a work of archaeology and anthropology, of cultural biology, a celebration of the marvels of the natural world--\"diversity is an ineluctable component of every time to establish order\"--and an acknowledgement that we are also living in a time when we seem to be \"killing and consuming every last living thing.\"\"We are the darkness, as we are, too, the light.\"My blood ran cold as I read in his simple introduction, depicting a time when he sits by a pool with his grandkids and ruminates: \"What is going to happen to us now, in a time of militant factions, of daily violence? . . . I wish each stranger around me, every one of them, an untroubled life. I want everyone here to survive what is coming.\" What. Is. Coming.This book is not an environmental alarm bell, as many climate change books are, as they should be: WAKE UP! This book is more reflective about man's capacity to explore, to want to know, not ignoring colonialism, rapacious greed leading to endless wars. This book is a kind of elegy, as he takes for granted the environmental catastrophe we are just beginning to really experience. It's a call--without much optimism--to create a different way, not just more recycling or even electric cars, a kind of incrementalist seventies approach, but a wholesale rethinking of the way we exist on this planet, a sustainable one:\"Our question is no longer how to exploit the natural world for human comfort and gain, but how we can cooperate with one another to ensure we will someday have a fitting, not a dominating, place in it.\"Lopez is watching the same tragically sad climate change conferences, opportunities for photo-ops for ignorant politicians bought out by Big Oil and other businesses meeting with the leaders of increasingly desperate island nations:\"The ongoing refusal of some governments and many politicians and business leaders to take global climate disruption seriously is part of a movement in some first-world countries to denounce any form of 'politically inconvenient' science. The ongoing resilience of this obdurate denial, of course, is an indication of the deteriorating state of public education in these countries.\"\"As the decades passed for me, I began to think that the path many of us now share, a path of self-realization and self-aggrandizement, might eventually leave us stranded, having arrived at the end of exploitation, but with most of us standing there empty-handed. And what is it that we have found through the injustice of exploitation that these Magdalenians at Altamira did not already possess?\"If the human race were inclined to do it, where might Lopez have us turn? To some common ground amid so many differences and friction:\". . . what most of us are looking for is the opportunity to express, without embarrassment or judgment or retaliation, our capacity to love.\"He wants us to reestablish a loving, cooperative relationship with the natural world and each other, while knowing hate and violence often over natural resources has always been with us. He wants us to look back to the past--as in archaeology, to see how ancestors survived, or not, and why--the present--what we are doing right and doing wrong, today, and to think of the future, how to avoid catastrophe as so many civilizations before us succumbed to.He wants us to return to valuing wisdom:\"One emerging view of Homo sapiens among evolutionary biologists is that he has built a trap for himself by clinging to certain orthodoxies in a time of environmental emergency. A belief in cultural progress, for example, or in the propriety of a social animal's quest for individual material wealth is what has led people into the trap, or so goes the thinking. To cause the trap to implode, to disintegrate, humanity has to learn to navigate using a reckoning fundamentally different from the one it's long placed its faith in. A promising first step to take in dealing with this trap might be to bring together wisdom keepers from traditions around the world whose philosophies for survival developed around the same uncertainty of a future that Darwin suggested lies embedded in everything biological. Such wisdom keepers would be people who are able to function well in the upheaval of any century. Their faith does not lie solely with pursuing technological innovation as an approach to solving humanity's most pressing problems. Their solutions lie with a profound change in what humans most value.\"Lopez always brings books with him when he travels, wherever he goes, as we all do, and he upholds the arts--the key to critical empathy--and the ways they help us appreciate the necessity of beauty, joy, to critique--as a key part of the foundation for survival. Stories, often at the heart of the artistic enterprise, are central for him in the hope for survival:\"Everything is held together with stories. That is all that is holding us together, stories and compassion.\"Conversations across differences--a thing we are particularly bad about now--sharing our stories across differences, are crucial, too:\"Conversations are efforts toward good relations. They are an elementary form of reciprocity. They are the exercise of our love for each other. They are the enemies of our loneliness, our doubt, our anxiety, our tendencies to abdicate. To continue to be in good conversation over our enormous and terrifying problems is to be calling out to each other in the night. If we attend with imagination and devotion to our conversations, we will find what we need; and someone among us will act—it does not matter whom—and we will survive.\"He is not naive; he knows we are in dire trouble:\"How are we to tone down the voices of nationalism, or of those in support of profiteering, or religious fanaticism, racial superiority, or cultural exceptionalism? If economic viability trumps human health in systems of governance, and if personal rights trump community obligations at almost every turn, what sort of future can we expect never to see?\"But of Earth, he says, and hopeful striving:\"Its only boundary was the horizon, the sill of the sky, separating what the eye could see from what the mind might imagine.\"\"I always sense that more room to maneuver exists. What halts us is simply a failure of imagination.\"In such a big book--a reflective memoir, but also an often exciting travel book--what we are left with is a series of images, talismanic symbols--an old colonial coin, Lopez storm-watching near his home at Cape Foulweather, an old man walking on a road in Port Famine. And always, astonishing portraits of animals and birds and landscapes all across this beautiful planet."

        "user_review": "Let me start at the end. Or the bottom. Antarctica, to be precise. I learned or re-learned that there is no longitude at the South Pole, that its lone coordinate is 90° South. From there, every direction is north. It's also where all the Earth's 24 time zones converge.* Which I had fun thinking about. Did you know that it never really snows at the South Pole? And that glacial ice fizzes and pops as it melts? Antarctica is also probably the only place on earth where you can get an unadulterated sip of water from a stream. Which Barry Lopez tells us about, seemingly as he puts lips to water. He also tells us how he took a quick bath in said stream. Which may: a) constitute too much information; b) compromise the formerly unadulterated nature of that water; and c) explain why I found this book both brilliant and annoying.Oh, I loved the places Lopez took me to: in addition to Antarctica, we traveled to Ellesmere Island, the Galapagos, Equatorial Africa, Australia, the French Polynesia, and even Oregon and Southern California, home ports for Lopez in his present and his long-ago past.And I loved what I learned about the cultures, the geography, the science. I loved, too, the purchase Lopez has with the language and perhaps his own argot, with water that is eithergin-clearorsun-shotand mucus that isglycerin-like. When he resorts to simile, sharks arelike swans milling on a city park pondand they form a kind of \"wall\" whichslides into the distance like a shoji screen.I didn't say he necessarily made things clearer.**Lopez likes to provoke though. Sometimes, I'd close the book, think on something he wrote, and wind up agreeing with him. Like when he said this:At the core of Darwin's idea about evolution is a very simple observation: every living thing has parents.Yet some of his glib statements I found to be silly, like:the failure to love or be loved explains most of the mental pain people endure.Or:Empathy for each other's predicaments, it seems to me, is the starting point for any system of justice.And he goes beyond silly, in my opinion.He lumps corporate officials and the bombardier aboard the Enola Gay with the World Trade Center terrorists. And he asks:In which Western nations does a determination to address the mental, spiritual, and physical health of children override indifference toward their fate?Which nations do the reverse? I'm open; but name one and explain how. And why is the question limited toWesternnations?Here's more:Empathy and compassion would seem to be requisite components in the development of any new politics that aimed to place human welfare, for example, above material profit in a restructuring of national priorities, or in the redesign of domestic economies.The author does not defineempathyorcompassionlet alonehuman welfare, nor does he get any more specific about the intricacies of his economic plan and how it will feed the people who need empathy. He gives no thresholds nor dosages. Who gets to legislate this? Who gets to enforce this? And does he just mean you-know-who, or will he don local apparel and explain all this to the Boko Haram raiders? I don't want to sound anti-compassion, but statements like that annoy me.Lopez is a fabulous writer and I admire the respect he has for cultures and nature. But he can be a little weird. For example, when he starts to think about genocide or environmental catastrophe, he will swim as far as he can into the ocean until it becomes problematic for him to get back safely. (Or so he says, because he always seems to make it back.) At one point he is outraged bytwo bumptious, overweight Americanswho express an interest in adolescent Thai girls. We can all agree with him, of course. But then he remembered a story about a West African man who was ritually scarred (men in the village biting his back into a crescent-shaped scar) for molesting a girl, and thisput me back on track.There was a time inArctic Dreamswhere he wrote about seeing a dead female polar bear with her vulva kind of exposed. He dwelt on that a little longer than I thought healthy. Here, he writes about smellingrot and pollinationand how,given the desolation of surrounding cliffs and the empty expanse of polar desert beyond, the soft wash of the redolent air across my face is stimulating to the point of being erotic.But I begrudge no one their fetishes. Just, you know, get your own tent.Lopez can be self-congratulatory and strikingly inconsistent. He begins the book, for example, by describing each of the curios or souvenirs he has acquired in his travels, but later he goes into great detail about his efforts to leave everything as he finds it in his scientific work.I know I sound annoyed, and maybe to you I sound disagreeable or wrong. And yet I gave it four-stars, you are thinking. Yes. Because this opened up vistas, Horizons maybe, and not just between the lines of Longitude and Latitude, but also in my own mind. It's good to be challenged and to accept that there may well be a better way.At one point in the book, Lopez goes to lunch with Mary Leakey. Okay, I'm envious. It's a good, quick story of their conversation and I let myself imagine that it was me on that veranda with her afterwards.She gazed at me through the blue haze of her cigar smoke with a bemused look, as though I did not really understand how the world worked._______________* In that way that books have a way of climbing over each other, at least in my reading life, just moments before I began this review I read in my current read,Timefulness, that Antarctica has \"No Official Time\" and was thus a place withno minutes or hours, wholly exempt from the tyranny of a schedule. In another coincidence, I read here:I imagine the giant squid, hunted a mile deep by a sperm whale. . . .That was the same day I was readingWho Would Win? Whale vs. Giant Squid. I won't tell you who won - I'm no plot-spoiler - but I can tell you this is a great series for 4 to 8 year old young'uns. I was worried that these might be too graphic, especially when the king cobra bites the komodo dragon, but my 6 year-old grandson can't get enough of them and guards them like baseball cards.**Other Lopez-speak:chert flakes,ocherous cliffs,glaucous gulls,parasitic jaegers,a glacial moraine of coarse gravel,the genetic variables in the joinery of haploid cells,fluxless sunlight,clinker plains in the lowlands, andwallowing in drip pools beneath scalesia trees festooned with epiphytes."

        "user_review": "Barry Lopez has written several good books, and I think he has written three great ones -- \"Of Wolves and Men,\" \"Arctic Dreams,\" and now \"Horizon.\" He is now in his seventies, and has been forthcoming about being ill. (Sadly Lopez has died since I wrote this) This book does have a sense of urgency, that he needed to get things down while there was still time, although it is a very Barry Lopez kind of urgency -- careful, thoughtful, planned.On one easy level, it is a travel book. Lopez has been to lots of places that are difficult to get to. He has worked with people studying the landscape, the history and the people of these regions. He has learned the science and the geography; he has read the books; he has talked with both the important and the unknown people. He writes well, even beautifully, about all of this, and that would certainly be enough to keep most of us reading with interest.But there are some overriding concerns and ideas that he keeps coming back to, whether he is in Australia or Africa or Antarctica. Except for the last one, of course, he stresses the need for local knowledge, for how those of us from outside need to learn from the indigenous people of places still at the edge of our pervasive civilization. His second concern is the desperate need to understand and protect environments and the creatures that live on them. Again, he has studied the science and he often has a very clear sense of what we do not know.But the point that is strongest in this book, near the end of his writing life, is the sense that after all that observation, all that study, we must recognize and cherish the mystery of these places, our uncertainty. Near the end of the book, Lopez writes, \"We go on professing confidently what we know, armed with a secular faith in all that is reasonable, even though we sense that mystery is the real condition in which we live, not certainty.\" It might even be his version of Keats' \"negative capability,\" even though he never says that. It is this sense of mystery that gives this book, perhaps all of his books, that particular vision that is so clearly his."

        "user_review": "Not at all to my personal taste. It should be: I am fascinated with the Antarctic and love unusual travel narratives. Lopez is beloved and seems like a thoughtful, even wise person. But my god, he is so self-serious; thisbookis so self-serious, and ponderous, and dull. There were some stunning moments, but the distance between them in this 500+ page repetitive slog felt as insurmountable as the lengths of Scott's final journey.Excuse me: I am just going outside and may be some time."

        "user_review": "As I get toward the end of this I'm realizing that it's less a review and more a rambling personal reflection, so I'll add this comment at the top for those of you who are just trying to decide if you want to read it. If you're a Lopez devotee, it's an obvious must-read, a rich and fascinating coda to an incredible life and career. But it would make a strange and I think not ideal introduction to his work, so if you haven't, go read Arctic Dreams or Light Action in the Caribbean first.Barry Lopez has a unique place among my favorite writers. I enjoy his work as much as I admire it, and the sense of depth and wisdom in it is always matched by the sense of intimacy and recognition. Of course his perspective doesn't now, and never did, despite his substantial influence, entirely match my own, but the way he integrates deeply felt but undogmatic passion in ethics, aesthetics, and curiosity into a single framework for understanding animals and material culture, science and indigenous knowledge, history and the physical world altogether is unmatched. But more on that later.I discovered his work only after missing my first chance to see him read in person. Recently I was lucky enough to see him speak at UIUC, and had the sense that he was already looking back on his career with a sense of finality. I didn't realize this book was planned; when I first heard it was coming out, I ordered a hardcover copy immediately and worked my way through it slowly over the next month and a half.Before Horizon, it had been a few years since I seriously engaged with Lopez' writing, though I've dipped into a few of his stories for inspiration. What the book offers, somewhat to my surprise, is really just more of the same sort of writing he's been producing for most of his career. That is, there's no hook or thesis or program. In that sense, it feels less distinctive and more pure Lopez than any particular piece of his other writing. It's a retrospective of his career, in the sense that it collects untold thoughts and experiences from places he visited throughout his life. That's not to say it feels like a random collection of unpublished scraps; far from it. The sense of intentionality and craft connecting this lifetime of insight and singular moments is all the more undeniable for its subtlety and range. It's just that none of the obvious summaries seem to quite fit. It focuses more on Lopez himself--his family, his personal habits, his emotions--than all but his most autobiographical pieces, but if you're hoping for anything genuinely surprising or revealing, you'll be disappointed. At one point he admits that a woodland scene reminds him of horror movies he's watched, but he doesn't name any, and otherwise the most recent non-literary pop culture he mentions is Mahler.So the Lopez of Horizon is the same Lopez as always, and to the extent that feels different to me now, it's because my own perspective has shifted. He is still, as other reviewers have pointed out, serious to the edge of self-parody. He's often warm and always self-aware, but never humorous or even self-deprecating. That isn't so much a problem to me, since the earnest investment in everything he turns his eye to, without the distance of irony or especially obvious in-group signifiers, lends his work a gravitas and pathos that few writers in this field can achieve, or even attempt without feeling trite or affected. It's his sense of honest and personal engagement that makes it all work.Because the most direct summary of what this book is, at least that I can think of, is \"the reflections of a saint on his pilgrimage through a broken and beautiful world.\" I hesitate to use that word--I'm not trying to canonize Lopez, no matter how great he is, nor am I trying to satirize him as self-righteous or moralizing. And his writing certainly isn't religious. But as much as that word is an uncomfortable fit in the context of contemporary American culture, it seems to capture the essence of what the book actually is. Unlike Lopez' previous writing, it isn't really a work of science or nature writing, or journalism, or even environmental exhortation or personal memoir.Instead, it's an invitation to look through Lopez' eyes as he traveled the world with his eyes on the horizon, so to speak, appreciating the transcendent beauty of light and form; appreciating human art and craftsmanship; acting as respectful ambassador to people of other cultures and classes; confronting the deepest depths of human evil; seeing the inherent human dignity in everyone around him; and grappling with the way individual animals, people, and cultures fit into the unfathomable stories of particular places. He cultivates a perspective that looks beyond single cultures or narrow moments in time and space to situate, at least in snapshot, modern humanity in a complete world--though of course he relies on cultural tools very particular to the West to do so.This perspective was the thing that drew me to Lopez in the first place, and it's interesting to revisit it now that my own worldview has taken on more diverse influences. I was introduced to his work during a time when I was a devoted acolyte of Derrick Jensen. Lopez saw the world in essentially the same terms, but even though I wasn't prepared to reject Jensen at the time, I could still appreciate that he brought a more level-headed, thoughtful approach to it, one that admitted more beauty, made fewer demands, and avoided the reckless and poorly considered intellectual leaps Jensen used to construct his elaborate and conveniently consistent worldview. Both of them provided a way of seeing history I've still rarely found articulated elsewhere, comprehending humans as a part of nature not just ecologically or in the abstract terms of sustainability, but intimately and ethically--and perhaps most importantly, doing so in a way that isn't a transparent attempt to reach some utopian notion of human-environment harmony. Since I've rejected Jensen's strident, flawed version of that perspective, Lopez has become the only one left to provide it.Only now, even his take on it is starting to feel a bit inadequate. The few moments of this book that do feel stuffy and out of touch to me are the times when he speculates about the dark implications of social media technology, or poses rhetorical questions about why we don't let councils of indigenous elders guide the future of humanity, or handwaves about corporate greed as a kind of inexplicable sui generis font of human suffering. It's just remarkable and occasionally frustrating to me that a lifetime of such wide-ranging curiosity and exposure to the world, Lopez has apparently never considered economic mechanisms (or even their ecological counterparts, for that matter) as forces endogenous to nature, transcending and shaping individual lives in much the same way as the many vast and beautiful processes he does care about. Instead, he treats these systemic questions as issues of personal morality and virtue, as if all of humankind were the crew of a ship trying to make decisions about our future as a single being--and only failing because of some inherent, mysterious malice unique to us.It seems like a substantial blind spot, especially since it provides a common language for humans and other organisms in a way that strongly supports his overall project. Without it, all of his keen perception and wise consideration can find no purchase on some of the biggest questions he raises in the moments of the book that try to make more conclusive statements about his lifelong preoccupations. Questions about the nature and origin of the most extreme kinds of suffering humans inflict on each other and life in general aren't just moments of tragic reflection--or at least, they don't have to be. They can be meaningfully answered with philosophical tools we already have.These minor frustrations left me feeling not so much disillusioned or disappointed with Lopez as reassured that I might now be in possession of a new and unique and valuable way of seeing things. That while I'm certainly not a writer of his caliber, or a personality or his drive, I might still be able to build on this tradition in a meaningful way.On the other hand, things I've been pursuing in my research lately have brought a clear appreciation of some of his core ideas. The way he talked about the coexistence between indigenous knowledge, Western science, and animal perception always tugged at an uncomfortable question of conflicting impulses for me, without ever clarifying how the pieces were meant to fit together. The reading and thinking I've done on semiotics and philosophy of science has made all of this, as well as a lot of the way he talks about place and the being in one can allow intuitive knowledge that can't be captured by words, feel utterly straightforward and not at all squishy or mystical.Similarly, I now have a more defined sense of my personal aesthetic preoccupations, so no longer find myself coming away from these pieces wanting to explore and experience the same things he's writing about. Instead, it makes me want to try to give my own interests and senses of the transcendental and fascinating a comparable treatment in terms of eloquence and devotion. Which is of course both more motivating and more interesting."

        "user_review": "Barry Lopez wrote about many subjects and even wrote fiction but is best known for his books about nature, particularly the Arctic. He felt the need to travel as much as to write, and Horizon is a kind of recollection of places he considered significant to a lifetime of travel and reflection. Not a memoir, the book nevertheless looks back on what he's learned about landscapes, about the wildlife and different kinds of societies he's seen. Sometimes he's writing about events that occurred decades ago. That the time shifts aren't always clear never diminishes the sharp revelations he writes.He always approaches and observes everything he contacts with a sense of wonder. Wonder and curiosity are necessary elements in the imperative toward the next boundary from which he can see another beckoning horizon.The book begins at Cape Foulweather, Oregon near his home. He's most interested in the weather there as it comes off the Pacific. Lopez is always aware of indigenous inhabitants, past and present. On Skraeling Island in Canada's Arctic he helps an archaeological team uncover an ancient Thule site. In the Galapagos he writes about evolution, Darwin, and Capt. James Cook's 18th century explorations of the Pacific. In Kenya's Rift Valley he's engaged in the search for man's hominid ancestors. He's disturbed by the changes man's progress our current Anthropocene period has had on landscapes and indigenous people. He uses Australia as his example in writing about our overuse of the land and its resources. In Antarctica he writes about the ways science studies the continent's icy desert.Lopez writes sensitively, poetically about it all. Given the wealth of insight he has into these relatively remote places and the enormous historical and scientific influences at work there, we'd forgive him more pedestrian prose, but his lyricism becomes part of what he experiences, as if one couldn't exist without the other. Sometimes the writing itself and the penetrating understanding of what he sees reminds me of the best of Joan Didion. I thought this especially true in the section on Australia. There's a lot to take in, but he makes reading it a pleasure.Adventure is a work he uses only once in the book, on p488, and not about himself. Mostly he thought of himself as a traveler. He takes part in the work wherever he goes: he helps harvest meteorites in Antarctica, he searches for prehistoric remains in Kenya, he's part of the archaeological dig on Skraeling Island. And he takes notes and writes constantly. But the reader may think the word adventure when he describes diving under the Ross Ice Shelf or taking off in a small plane in Kenya where there's no airstrip.Sadly, Lopez died this past Christmas Day. He left us some wonderful pictures and perspectives of nature and man."

So I'll start with those - first, that some of the language he used seemed sexist but in a subtle way, which is always so frustrating especially when you can't quite put a finger on it; and second, he seemed so certain that a solution would arise if we just listened to elders, which were vaguely defined stereotypes of wise native men. I don't disagree that we need to listen to more native voices, in fact this book drove that home for me more than anything, but being told my some American, detached man to listen to their perfect wisdom struck the wrong chord.What I did like - the whole book felt like a steady mediation, a calm, deep walk. I felt inspired to listen more and better, to observe quietly, to open myself to opportunities by being present, to journal and record and reflect on the things I see. And I also felt more informed about humanity, its origins, its evolution, its hubris. Arctic Dreams is definitely now at the top of my to-read list."

It's been my privilege to get to some of the same regions, which provides me as a reader the advantage of a sense of verification as we see things from Mr Lopez' perspective. It's also been my privilege to have had some personal communication with Mr. Lopez that provides a sliver of insight--mainly that he is completely authentic.But I know him mainly because I've been a fan since someone handed me \"Arctic Dreams\" while I was above the Arctic Circle doing research on falcons at age 32. A National Book Award winner, Arctic Dreams is a fantastic book, one that Mr. Lopez's wife described to me (if I remember correctly) as a \"once in a lifetime\" achievement. But her comment came a few minutes before I met Barry for the first time and many years before his last spate of work. I think we can now say that Horizon makes it \"twice in a lifetime,\" at least.A deeply personal book, written from the high hill of a long life of broad vision and deep reflection—and some trauma—Horizon shows a world both magnificent and tragic. Lopez seems to find his heart's home in the vast unpeopled purity of Antarctica, a place he returns to repeatedly.For me as an ecologist, some of the most interesting bits in the book occur when Lopez considers with admirable honesty his interactions with researchers, and theirs with him.But the main reason for giving this book the time it deserves is that it opens an enormous swath of life, time, and reflection, the wisdom of which we are free to mine thanks to Barry Lopez's generosity of spirit and his desire to show us what he has seen and gleaned of life."

The 500+ pages became a slog. One major theme of this book questions how the dominant cultures of the world are ignoring real perils we all face, the chief of them all being climate change. Yet as a globetrotter he never seemed to question how he himself has contributed to the problem (or more importantly, how lifestyles like his have done so).I kept wanting to like the book. I agree with his viewpoints on almost every issue he raised. And after further reading about him, he seems like he was a five star person. But the book gets two."

        "user_review": "This is a tremendous book. Lopez in a pensive, troubled, self critical, or perhaps better phrased, a self-questioning mood. What is it to travel? What does the traveller learn, take away, or importantly what does he or she take along with them. I can't recall a book in recent years that I've been this immersed in."

        "user_review": "http://www.bookwormblues.net/2020/07/...I've been on a bit of a travel kick recently, but there's a pandemic and I'm immunocompromised, so the only real way I can currently travel is through books. A little while ago, I went online and put out a call, \"I need to go on a vacation, but I still can't really risk leaving the house. Tell me what books I should read that will take me on a mental vacation.\" Someone mentioned, \"Anything by Barry Lopez\" and here we are.I've never read a Barry Lopez book. In fact, I'd never heard of the man before, and what an absolute crime that is. The reader who needed a vacation in me was thrilled at this particular find. The writer and editor who makes a career out of words was basically in heaven. This book scratched every possible itch for me.This isn't like the other travelogues I've read. He both goes into a lot of detail about the numerous locations he visits, and he doesn't. In Horizon, the book is largely about the distance, some point, far off, where heaven and earth connect. That line that bisects everything known, from everything unknown, and how said horizon can be both far away, and much closer than we really expect. That theme weaves itself through the narrative. He spends a bit of time in this book, hopping between a few different locations around the world, and in each different place, he both experiences and ponders different things, muses about the nature of humanity, and all the ways we are connected. I never quite knew what I was in for.For example, he spends some time at the start of the book at Cape Foulweather in Washington. While I did feel he spent less time explaining the topography of the land he was immersed in than I expected, I didn't actually end up lamenting that fact. Instead, he used his time at that location to weave together not only the narrative of his journey and experiences, but tied his time there with the past, with information about Captain Cook, and somehow managed to weave that in with his current experience, and even some musing about the future as well. It was all so artfully done, I felt like I'd fallen prey to some spell he'd woven. I was just completely taken away by his mastery of the tale he was telling.\"He spent his life charting raw space, putting down grids and elevations, but he also understood what could not be charted, the importance of the line that separated the known from the unknown. He understood what occurred in the silence between two musical notes. He also knew, I believe, the indispensability of this.\"This was pretty standard issue with every location he spent time at. Each place would drive him to examine the past, the present, and look toward the future as well. This is, perhaps, why the title of the book, Horizon, is quite apt, as the horizon is, quite literally, the point where he would often tie all of these strings together. It is both known, and tantalizingly unknown.His writing was what really impressed me, though. There are certain authors I read just because I want to see and understand how they use words. It is part of what drives me. Words, language, the power of all of that is something I can't get away from. Hey, I'm a full-time book editor, a published author, and book reviewer. My life is made up of words and how they are used to their full effect. Lopez is a very lyrical writer, and if you've read either of my books, you know that lyrical writing is my jam. I often found myself completely captivated by how he would twist phrases, manipulate words, and pack a powerful punch with all of the above. He doesn't write on one level, but multiple levels, and I loved that. I loved the way I could be reading about, for example, Captain Cook, but also very much be reading about my own human experience in the world, as well as Lopez's. Layers and metaphor are my playground, and Lopez is a master of that particular craft.Horizon is a work of art. I was enchanted not only by the journey Barry Lopez takes throughout this work, but how well he ties together the human experience, showing that we are not islands unto ourselves, but connected to each other, to the world as a whole, to history, to the future. He doesn't shy away from hard truths, like our changing landscape, and our responsibility for said changes. Neither does he seem to lose all hope. That being said, it is the quiet moments that had the most impact on me. The moments where he seems to put everything else aside, and just quietly reflect.\"The history of art in the West, I believe, can be viewed as the history of various experiments with volumes of space and increments of time, with frequencies of light and of sound. Art's underlying strength is that it does not intend to be literal. It presents a metaphor and leaves the viewer or listener to interpret. It is giving in to art, not trying to divine its meaning, that brings the viewer or listener the deepest measures of satisfaction. Art does not aspire to entertain. It aspires to converse.\"The horizon is not just something to explore, a hazy, far off dream, but a point of connection. In a world that, despite our connectivity, feels increasingly disconnected, this book ended up be the exact medicine my soul needed. Horizon is a poetic, powerful examination of the human soul, the larger world, and the horizon, which both connects and obscures. Filled with some of the most beautiful writing I've come across in a long time, and an overwhelming sense of wonder and respect, this book put Barry Lopez on my radar, and I'm excited to spend some time reading more of his work.\"The moment of surprise informs you emphatically that the way you once imagined the world is not the way it is. \"To explore,\" he says, \"is to travel without a hypothesis.\""

This book overwhelms and courteously invites you to consider your own humanity, the wildness of the earth, and possibility of hopelessness and hope. It raises a deeply serious question about our \"survivability\" because of the deepening loss of community, compassion and empathy. It doesn't leave me hopeless, but I feel on the edge of hopelessness. Is it too late?\"What we say we know for sure changes every day, but no one can miss now the alarm in the air. Our question is, What is out there, just beyond the end of the road, out beyond our language and fervent belief, beyond whatever gods we've chosen to give our allegiance to? Are we waiting for travelers to return, to tell us what they say beyond that line? Or are we now to turn our heads, in order to hear better the call coming to us from that other country? It arrives as a cantus, tying the faraway place to the thin living deep within us, a canticle that releases us from the painstaking assembly of our milagros, year after year, and from a faith only in miracles\" (512)."

        "user_review": "Barry Lopez is a master of capturing the essence of a journey, both in the physical and spiritual sense. He approaches his subjects--in this case, a handful of remote spaces on the globe including the Arctic, Antarctic, Galapagos Islands, the wild coast of Oregon, an African savannah and others--both with reverence and a critical eye.The journeys he relates in Horizon are perhaps even more personal this time, as each place triggers memories of a deep and wide variety of experience, of not just geographical space, but emotional and psychological revelation.Lopez' writing is masterful, as always. This is a volume to savor, to immerse yourself in Lopez' sense of place and state of mind, two feet firmly on the ground but an eye to the horizon. My only regret is that this book has a bit of a feeling of closure, as if Mr. Lopez might not write another epic, at least of this scale."

        "user_review": "\"I fell into conversation with a local man about this feeling that so many visitors have of attaining here a state of transcendent peace. Concerning the modern significance of these islands, he had this reflection: \"La tierra puede transformar el alma y lamente, y corazón de todos los hermanos.\" (\" It's possible for this place to shift your soul, to ameliorate the pain of modern existence, to elevate the heart of everyone who visits here.\")\"\"My goal was to experience the world intensely and then to put into words as well as I could what I'd seen. I was aware others could see better than I, and also that other people were not able to travel in the way I had begun to, going away habitually. And whatever a reader might make of what I tried to describe, I already understood that their conclusions might not match my own. I saw myself, then, as a sort of courier, a kind of runner come home from another land after some exchange with it and its denizens, carrying, by way of a story, some incomplete bit of news about how different, how marvelous and incomprehensible, really, life was, out beyond the pale of the village in which I had grown up. Looking back, I see that this ideal—to imagine myself in service to the reader—had me balanced on the edge of self-delusion. But it was at the time my way of working. It didn't occur to me that taking life so seriously might cause a loss of perspective. How else, I would ask, could you take it?\"Every word of this book was carefully chosen, and they are steeped in the self-reflection of a lifetime, and as if the author knows his time on earth is short, and while serious, and honest about our flaws, it also lifts us up and makes us cherish the earth even more than we did before. There are flaws to his stories, also, but it is the most deeply personal book of his, and the ultimate storyteller seems to want to reveal himself, and remind us, by god, the world is full of contradiction and paradox, and each of us contain the dark and the light, and each place is a heaven and hell.Last weekend, I was on a hike near Vail, Colorado and pleased as punch with myself that I had found a new wildflower I had never seen before; it was this lovely white lily or daisy looking one, with flowers clustered vertically that reminded me of shooting stars, with very distinctive purple stripes on the inside and mustard yellow spots on the petals. It turned out to be a mountain death camas and consuming them can be fatal, beauty and death in the same entity, and that type of contrast is evident in all these stories.Part of his appeal is his travels to exotic places and his participation in various scientific endeavors that we ostensibly never will, but what I really love is the way his language is like a poem or a prayer, even as he is merely relating some dry scientific facts; he is awake and aware to the spiritual quality of the land and how that brings meaning to our lives. His intro alone had me in raptures, and I absorb his words and stories for the meaningful and coherent \"trajectory\" of my own life.Some stories spoke to me more than others, but this will be something I will reread again and again, as a treasure trove of insights and ways of being in the world, on the earth, that I crave and collect.\"He was advocating for the sort of emotional and spiritual relationships all cultures experience in their encounters with their places, and which many of these cultures still enshrine alongside their more empirical, or analytical, responses to those same places, finding those perceptions equally valid in furthering an understanding of what is, finally, beyond understanding.\"\"My further desire in planning this book was to create a narrative that would engage a reader intent on discovering a trajectory in her or his own life, a coherent and meaningful story, at a time in our cultural and biological history when it has become an attractive option to lose faith in the meaning of our lives. At a time when many see little more on the horizon but the suggestion of a dark future.\"\"Embedded in the system of belief that over the years came to replace (or perhaps augment) religion for me is a conviction that the numinous dimension of certain inanimate objects is substantial, as real as their texture or color. This is not, I think, an illusion. One might not be able to \"squeeze meaning\" from a stone, but a stone, presented with an opportunity, with a certain kind of welcoming stillness, might reveal, easily and naturally, some part of its meaning.\"Words.Olla podrida- a Spanish stew, or any collection of miscellaneous itemsFlânerie, Flaneur - aimless idle behavior, one who engages inDeclivity- a downward slopeLiminal- occupying a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold.Moonraker- A small, light sail located high on a mast (above the skysail) and used for speedPlosive- denoting a consonant that is produced by stopping the airflow using the lips, teeth, or palate, followed by a sudden release of air.Knapper: one who will shape (a piece of stone, typically flint) by striking it so as to make stone tools or weapons or to give a flat-faced stone for building walls.Debouch- emerge from a narrow or confined space into a wide, open area.Xeric- (of an environment or habitat) containing little moisture; very dryMesic- (of an environment or habitat) containing a moderate amount of moisture. Compare with hydric and xeric.Tombolo- two landmasses connected by a narrow isthmus.Inflorescence- the process of floweringUmwelt- (in ethology) the world as it is experienced by a particular organism.Meretriciousness- apparently attractive but having in reality no value or integrity.Disquisitions- a long or elaborate essay or discussion on a particular subject.Lebensraum- 1. Additional territory deemed necessary to a nation, especially Nazi Germany, for its continued existence or economic well-being. 2. Adequate space in which to live, develop, or function.\"I spent hours on the cape emptying my mind of analysis, suspending its incessant quest for essence, and regularly encountered in doing so William Blake's enduring metaphor, that the entire world is rendered for us in a single grain of sand.\"\"When in 1979 I encountered a traditional group of people for the first time on their home ground, at a small Nunamiut Eskimo village called Anaktuvuk Pass, in Alaska's Brooks Range, I had among my first thoughts an obvious question: Why did I know so little about these people? I didn't mean knowledge about their material culture or their hunting techniques or the way they were able to survive in the harsh landscape they'd chosen to live in, but about the way they understood the world. What did they find mysterious but still worthy of their full attention?\"\"But one can choose, as well, to step into the treacherous void between oneself and the confounding world, and there to be staggered by the breadth, the intricacy, the possibilities of that world, accepting its requirement for death but working still to lessen the degree of cruelty and to increase the reach of justice in every quarter.\"\"It's been my experience that these hours of perusing the water, here or while at sea—taking in the occasional bird or surfacing whale, watching light shift on the surface—induce an awareness of another sort of time, a time that fills an expansive and undifferentiated volume of space, one not easily available elsewhere. On those days, such a seemingly mindless vigil offers relief from the monotony of everyday experience.\"\"The images of nebulae and galaxies were wondrous. Mesmerizing. With images like these before us, I remember thinking, our direst problems as a species—desertification, collapsing fisheries, barbarism, poverty, species extinction—might shrink down into something conceivably manageable. These images of timeless creation, carefully contemplated, might unfreight a depressed soul. They prompted in me a sense of the impossible having given way to the possible, a feeling as intense as the despair I'd once felt before I looked at Fernando Botero's drawings of tortured prisoners at Abu Ghraib, or before I looked at Sebastião Salgado's photographs of broken families, victims of drought, famine, and war.\"\"I subscribe, I suppose, to a popular notion, that \"the [undisturbed] land heals,\" that it can bring the disheveled or distracted mind to a state of calm transcendence. Exposure to an unusually spectacular place in conducive circumstance, the thinking goes, can release one from the prison of one's own ego and initiate a renewed awareness of the wondrous, salutary, and informing nature of the Other, the thing outside of the self.\"\"William Blake, prominently in Western history, wanted to rid the human imagination of a particular kind of darkness, the darkness that leads to despair, to hatred and war, by opening it wider to both the real and the numinous dimensions of the world. He wanted humanity to realize the immeasurable breadth of the human imagination, its capacity to rise above fatal despair, even as the world grew darker at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Somewhere, Camus wrote: \"The world is beautiful, and outside it there is no salvation.\" Blake and Camus were asking us to set aside our cherished illusions and to engage instead with the problems they both saw coming.\"\"The wildness around me here, the clearing where I camp and the stands of undisturbed old-growth Sitka spruce beyond, within which the brightest light at midday is still only crepuscular, is not a point of arrival for me. It is my point of departure.\"\"At the foot of the glacier I squat down in order to hear more loudly the percolation of meltwater from the glacier's cold lip, the hissing bursts of air as small pockets within the ice release their stores of ancient atmosphere. With my head tilted this close, I can feel the glacier's frigid exhalation against my cheekbones. For a few moments the density of the silence in the valley exists in concert with the continuous sound of this huge object's meltdown.\"\"The idea that \"beauty\" refers to a high level of coherence existing everlastingly in the world, and that beauty can be renewed in us through reintegrating ourselves with a world over which we have no control, has appealed to me ever since I became aware of this Navajo ceremony, a formal expression of that idea.\"\"Everyone I know who's dug up the material culture of a vanished people somewhere on Earth longs for a conversation with the subjects of their inquiry, with the cave painters at Chauvet in the Ardèche Valley in southeastern France, with the Clovis hunters at Blackwater Draw in New Mexico, with the Semites at Ur, or with the Thule. If I could speak with the Thule, I would want to know what they found beautiful, and in what, precisely, had they placed their enduring faith.\"\"If I were to scribe a line on a map of the Pacific this evening, straight away to the northwest, it would not cut a shoreline but for Galápagos's for 6,098 miles, not until it came to the Aleutian Islands. If I were to draw another line straight south, it would not encounter a coast until it met the wall of the Abbot Ice Shelf in Antarctica, 4,993 miles distant. If I looked to my left and imagined the far-off Bay of Panama, and then to my right and envisioned the Philippine Sea, the span would be more than 10,000 miles. The Pacific is twice the size of the Atlantic, a comparison perhaps too incomprehensible to convey meaning. If in a cartoon, Mount Everest were placed on the floor of the Mariana Trench south of Guam, its peak would fall 6,800 feet short of the surface of the Pacific. If one were truly to comprehend the size of the thing, one would be halfway to imagining God.\"\"Our question is, What is it out there, just beyond the end of the road, out beyond language and fervent belief, beyond whatever gods we've chosen to give our allegiance to? Are we waiting for travelers to return, to tell us what they saw beyond that line? Or are we now to turn our heads, in order to hear better the call coming to us from that other country? It arrives as a cantus, tying the faraway place to the thing living deep inside us, a canticle that releases us from the painstaking assembly of our milagros, year after year, and from a faith only in miracles.\""

        "user_review": "I read several of Lopez's earlier works and always enjoyed them. More than enjoyed, I've cherished them for their language, their metaphor, their imagery, their thought-provoking narrative, ...Horizonhas all of the above and something more, something I wasn't prepared for and something which saddened me, something I noticed within the first fifteen-twenty pages of the book.Horizon's tone is not the hopeful, visionary tone of his previous pieces. It is sad, beaten, disappointed, perhaps even remorseful. Several of the shared anecdotes have an undercurrent of \"You fools! I warned you about this fifty years ago! Why didn't you listen?\"Lopez revists many of the places where he did his best writing and storytelling. But instead of bringing these remote locations to life, he shares how they've changed for the negative; more pollution, more cultural destruction, more species extinction, more poverty, basically more ugliness. I felt Lopez's title was allegorical, metaphysical; he saw his own horizon - he mentions his age, health, and memories many times - and culture's horizon - he mentions what we've lost by not paying attention to those who came before us, by placing individual financial profit above group and environmental well-being.Overall, I couldn't help feel Lopez was saying good-bye. I did a little research and discoveredHorizonwas his last finished work. He died of prostate cancer complications shortly afterHorizon's publication, and very shortly after his beloved Finn Rock home was destroyed by fire.It is a beautiful, if saddening, read."

No basta haber recorrido unos ochenta países como hizo Barry Lopez (1945 -2020) para confirmar que este planeta habitado por humanos no deja de maravillarnos, aunque muchos pueblos indígenas estén desapareciendo por la intromisión de sus hermanos.El escritor estadounidense se dedicó, en la que fue su última obra, a hacer un recorrido por su vida a la vez que desgranó su mundo en diferentes meridianos de Greenwich como la Antártida, Tasmania, el lago Turkana en África, y otros muchos. Viajero incansable que no dejaba escapar ninguna oportunidad para sumarse a cualquier expedición que fuera al lugar más descabellado posible, procuró escuchar al otro e intentó no ser un invasor por su procedencia. Claro que, cuando te encuentras en un poblado del norte de Botsuana donde los nativos te dicen que no quieren unas pastillas para el dolor de cabeza porque prefieren que les falte, te replanteas toda tu existencia.Hombre de vasta cultura y con curiosidad por siempre preguntar más, diseccionó todo lo que su vista alcanzaba, aunque cercano ya al destino final creyera que «una vida prolongada puede interpretarse como una especie de catarata de intenciones recordadas a medias» (pág. 31).\" Amatulláh Hussein"
