        "user_review": "Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because Ireallydidn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish?And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves.And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there."

        "user_review": "\"I'm going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\"— Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds don't view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven't come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.InHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead's questions — and then some.Not only doesDeathly Hallowsrevisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil's Snare, Harry's best mate Ron bellows \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him\"Are you a wizard, or what?\"thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling's books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry's bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry's last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret \"shout-out\" to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that \"neither shall live while the other survives\", and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end.More than any of the other Potter books,Deathly Hallowsis a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort's Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears.This is not to say thatDeathly Hallowsdoesn't offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn't all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio showPotterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling's farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied."

I regret not reading it when I was younger, but I am so happy that I finally did, better late than never, right?The world built in these books is so real and tangible, it is truly a masterpiece. The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book.I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did. As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart. Now, having finished the last line, I am flooded with emotion. This series is more than a story or words on a page, it is magic."

I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\"- Interesting how, despite not hearing the prophesy, Voldemort came to the same solution on his own. Albeit for different reasons.(2) Bellatrix is the worst kind of groupie.(3) Tonks and Lupin are married already? I guess they eloped.08/05/2020- 4%(1) I don't want to attribute symbolism where there might be none, but wizards really do react to their wands being broken like they've been gelded.(2) \"The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.\"- Hermione has been plenty stupid before. It's just that hers has to do with common sense.08/06/2020- 6%(1) \"What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike?\"- I mean, saying nothing is always an option, that is, if you dislike them enough to not even want to talk.(2) It wouldn't surprise me at all if Dedalus Diggle was modeled after the White Rabbit. He's short, constantly checks his giant pocket watch, and always worries about being late.08/07/2020- 8%(1) Re Polyjuice: '\"Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\" said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron's raised eyebrows, blushing slightly.'- Foreshadowing the later Ron subplot.(2) '\"Hold tight now, Ron,\" said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on ... her waist.'- Well, can't look too eager.08/08/2020- 11%(1) Lupin: \"Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!\"- Exactly what I've been saying!(2) 'Hermione flew at [Ron] and hugged him tightly. \"I thought — I thought —\"\"I'm all right,\" said Ron, patting her on the back.\"'- Ah, Ron's learning.

Mark your territory.08/10/2020- 18%(1) Harry's already got Ginny, so why does Ron gift him a book on getting girls?(2) \"You've really got an eye for that sort of thing.\"\"Thank you, Ron!\" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry [smiled] to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments [in] his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches.08/11/2020- 21%(1) '\"Come and dance,\" [Ron] added abruptly to Hermione. She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.\"Ah, they are together now?\" asked Krum, momentarily distracted.\"Er — sort of,\" said Harry.'- Harry being a total bro.- Krum seems allayed by this news, like a suspicion's been proven true.08/12/2020- 23%(1) Harry: \"We just need to wipe their memories.\"Ron: \"But I've never done a Memory Charm.\"Hermione: \"Nor have I ... but I know the theory.\"- Didn't Hermione do a memory charm on her parents? I guess there's a difference between erasing a memory and implanting false ones.(2) Ron takes every chance to hug Hermione. So he's either an opportunist or formed a habit.08/13/2020- 26%(1) \"[Hermione's] fingers inches from Ron's. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made [Harry] feel strangely lonely.\"- Classic third-wheel talk right there.(2) Ron: \"Elf magic isn't like wizard's magic... I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can't.\"- Wizarding common sense is why Ron's valuable.08/14/2020- 29%(1) Re arresting Muggle-borns: \"I'll tell everyone Hermione's my cousin.\"Hermione covered Ron's hand with hers and squeezed it. \"Thank you, Ron, but I couldn't let you.\"\"You won't have a choice,\" said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back.\"- Ah, the old Abram and Sarai in Egypt trick.(2) \"Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him.\"- See, Ron's useful.08/15/2020- 32%(1) \"Harry felt sure [Ron and Hermione] were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.\"- Classic third-wheel talk right there.(2) '\"Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore's study — Merlin's pants!\" [Hermione] shrieked.'- I know enough of British English to understand that \"pants\" means something markedly different than the American definition.08/16/2020- 35%(1) \"A bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down ... to protect the prosecutors from ... from the dementors.\"- Umbridge's patronus reveals the viciousness beneath her kitty exterior.(2) '\"Expec — Expecto patronum,\" said Hermione.

Mrs. Cattermole.'- Well, glad she has a flaw.08/17/2020- 37%(1) \"Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.\"- Hermione swoons over sensitive Ron. He should do that more often.- #1 rule of swooning: don't get caught swooning.(2) Hermione's an awful cook. Flaws make her endearing.08/18/2020- 39%(1) Ted Tonks: \"The Prophet? ... You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\"- Ah, in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king... or however it goes.(2) Ron: \"We're about as near getting rid of [the horcrux] as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!\"- \"Effing\"? Some evil locket! Can't even influence Ron to use real effing swears.08/19/2020- 41%Kiss rejected! Sorry, Harry. She loves Ron.(1) Hermione: \"I'm staying. Ron, we said we'd go with Harry, we said we'd help.\"Ron: \"I get it. You choose him.\"Hermione: \"Ron, no — please — come back, come back!\"- Ah, the subtext is exquisite.(2) \"[Hermione] threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.\"- That's 4/7 books she's had a big Ron-cry.08/20/2020- 43%(1) \"Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs.\"- Harry must be thinking, \"I can't smell that bad? Can I?\"(2) Harry: \"Gryffindor came from Godric's Hollow?\"Hermione: \"As the village is named after him, I'd have thought you might have made the connection.\"08/21/2020- 45%(1) \"[Hermione] stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase.\"- When feeling shaky, bookcases are Hermoine's refuge.(2) \"[Harry] left [Hermione] sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.\"- On one hand, she broke his wand by accident. On the other hand, she did render him magically impotent.08/22/2020- 47%Literally Ron's worst nightmare.(1) Rita Skeeter: 'Elphias \"Dogbreath\" Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick [Dumbledore] had picked up at school.'- Sounds like film-Ron, except for the \"Dogbreath\" part. Lavender, for one, seemed to love his breath.(2) Rita Skeeter openly admits to using Veritaserum on Bathilda Bagshot. Last I checked, that was illegal.08/23/2020- 49%Ah, relationship back to normal. ¡La pasión!(1) Riddle: \"Least loved, always ... Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend ... Second best, always, eternally overshadowed.\"(2) \"Riddle-Hermione ... was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione.\"- Don't tell that to real Hermione that... being terrible to Ron's totally her thing.08/24/2020- 51%(1) Harry: \"She's like my sister ... I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew.\"- Didn't seem that way in the film... funny way to act toward your sister.(2) Ron destroys the locket and then has himself a big Hermione-cry. Eh, he was due. Seeing as she has four big Ron-cries under her belt.08/25/2020- 53%(1) Hermione to Harry: \"Maybe it's something you need to find out for yourself.\"Ron: \"Yeah! ... That makes sense.\"Hermione: \"No, it doesn't!\"- Being anti-Ron conflicts with being logical.(2) Harry: \"You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\"Ron: \"All's fair in love and war, and this is a bit of both.\"- Aww, he loves her... I'm sure not as a sister.08/26/2020- 55%(1) '\"There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —\"\"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron ... Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.'- Don't compare your girl to your mum!(2) Xenophilius: \"[Luna] is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.\"Harry: \"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\"- Checkmate!08/27/2020- 58%(1) Potterwatch code names:- Lee Jordan is River (as in Jordan River)- Kingsley is Royal (kings are royal)- Remus is Romulus (twin founders of Rome)- Fred is Rodent (because Weasley sounds like weasel), but wants to be called Rapier (???)(2) Hermione: \"I only said that to try and persuade you ... I didn't really believe it!\"- Questionable morals, that Hermione.08/28/2020- 60%(1) Why bother to change your name if you don't want anyone to say it?(2) '\"What is it, Wormtail?\" called Lucius Malfoy from above.\"Nothing!\" Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail's wheezy voice. \"All fine!\"'- I didn't know Ron could imitate voices. Must be a hit at parties.(3) Wonder if it still counts as suicide if your arm has a mind of its own?08/29/2020- 62%(1) Harry uses three wands at once to stupefy Greyback... makes you wonder whether multiple-core wands are a thing, or why no one owns more than one wand.- It'd probably be akin to using a machine gun.(2) \"With a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.\"08/30/2020- 64%(1) \"The steady rhythm of [Harry's] arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows ... Horcruxes ... Hallows ... Horcruxes ...\"- In the end, he chooses horcruxes.(2) Hermione and Luna wearing Fleur's clothes is a touch of hilarity beneath the sadness.(3) \"Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.\"- Aww... it's like a bicycle-built-for-two.08/31/2020- 66%(1) Olivander: \"Walnut and dragon heartstring ... Twelve-and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\"- As a woodworker, I can say that walnut has high acidity, and is one of the few species too toxic for mulch.(2) Hermione: \"I'm a Mudblood!\"Ron: \"Don't call yourself —\"Hermione: \"Why shouldn't I? ... Mudblood, and proud of it!\"09/01/2020- 68%(1) Bill: \"Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you'll know all that from History of Magic.\"- Yes, History of Magic... smile and nod.(2) '\"Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \"Congratulations!\" and Ron said, \"Blimey, a baby!\" as if he had never heard of such a thing before.'- To be fair, Ron was a year old when Ginny was a baby.09/02/2020- 70%(1) '\"You'll be using [Bellatrix's] actual wand,\" said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, \"so I reckon you'll be pretty convincing.\" Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her.'- Just don't use it for firewood or compost... walnut's toxic.(2) Harry casts the Imperius Curse which, while Unforgivable, is probably forgivable in this instance.09/03/2020- 72%(1) \"Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.\"- Ah, how very Ron and Hermione. How they each handle stress strikes at the heart of their personalities.(2) I think it's indicative of how good a job he's done that I've not mentioned Stephen Fry at all during this re-read.09/04/2020- 75%(1) '\"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters. Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.'- Well, it must be a real Hallow then, not summonable and thus not subject to other magic.(2) 'It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, \"Expecto Patronum!\"'- Aww... they're Harry's happy thought!09/05/2020- 77%(1) Ron: \"Yeah, well, food's one of the five exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration.\"- Hermione must be beaming.(2) Seamus: \"We've been hiding out [in the Room of Requirement] ... and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up —\"Lavender: \"— and thought they'd quite like to wash, yes.\"- So... boys don't \"require\" washing?09/06/2020- 79%(1) Harry uses the Cruciatus Curse and McGonagall uses the Imperius Curse. Sure, rules get thrown out when it comes to war, but do the ends justify the means?(2) In the film McGonagall duels Snape one-on-one until he flees. In the book, it's Flitwick that runs Snape off.(3) 'Professor McGonagall dryly, \"we teachers are rather good at magic, you know.\"'- Ha! Sassy.*character limitClick here for the rest"

The final adventure, towards which we've been sailing for - through six amazing Hogwarts years - is here at last. And yet again, Rowling surpasses her own standards to bring us the most adventurous book of the entire series, to conclude everything is a most dramatic way. Twist after twist after twist is going to keep the reader immersed more than ever. Be warned: once started, you won't have a moment's rest till your finish this one!\"Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches\"It seems redundant now to repeat all the good things about Harry Potter books in general - from plot to writing style - which never reached a plateau, but kept on improving. All of that is still there. But setting up the atmosphere for events has reached a level that is far beyond anything we've seen before. And the complexity of the events has also been increased. Even the few sup-plots are highly detailed and complex, and contributes a lot to the main story. It gives a very fulfilling feeling, when the reader is allowed to connect all the dots as progressing towards the end, tying up a lot of loose ends. Also, it's unbelievable how well the plot twists are introduced - whether they are happy or sad - maintaining suspense better than ever.\"permettez-moi to assister vous,\"The reader is bound to encounter a lot of heartbreaking disappointments here, but all that help make the ending much more satisfying. I did miss the occasional humor, though it would not have complimented well the dark world we are in right now. Oh, and I'm really happy that I only had to hate Snape for a few days... (from finish of Half-blood prince till now) I guess that's the good thing about reading all the books of series at once: less anxiety!\"Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure!\"When I started Philosopher's Stone, it made me realize that I've been missing out on a lot - a world of magic which is full of amazing characters. Then the journey got ever so thrilling and entertaining, with each book outperforming the previous one in every possible way. It's been three magical weeks for me - literally and figuratively - from the starting of the first book till the last. I don't recall ever been immersed in a book series as much as I did with Harry Potter, and, though the ending was great, it's sad not being able to continue, to know that this is the end. I've watched the first few HP movies a long time ago, but those didn't come anywhere near the books in my opinion, and I really wasn't a fan. But now, I'm finally enlightened as to why Harry Potter series is much loved by millions. It's impossible not to, once you're through with the books! A well thought out foundation put in place in first three books, then setting stage for the core of the series in next two and finally, an incredibly thrilling ending with the last two books, while each book being a five-star read, at least for me. Harry Potter became the my all-time-favorite book series.\"Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,\""

        "user_review": "Hot take: I like A Very Potter Musical more than I like the Harry Potter series. Please feel free to physically fight me. (And no, \"AVPM wouldn't exist without the series\" is not a valid argument, because duh.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...God, what an unexpected result this is.Let's talk about it for six pages.I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series forfive months.More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February,and I didn't pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort's, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let's talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin' but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw thosegloriousGIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like,What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we're eating?(Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying \"Accio salmon\" in order to eat and were just like,That information's going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and takeliterally no effortby the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I'm almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it's over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I'm big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We'll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he's Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he's treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD'S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that's who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He's barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we'll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT'S \"Garry\") just based off of Ginny's apparent greatness. BUT NO IT'S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn't be less cute. It's justI miss Ginnyyyyyyyyyoverandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It's just J.K. Rowling being like,Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here's a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne,Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer.SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN'S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don't...I don't even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn't Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn't Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she's all, \"Why won't Lupin loooooooove me.\" Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn't mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn't mean that James's dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don't just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, \"Oh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I'll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it's almost like I've emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!\"You can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She's a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can't!!! Because shekeeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, \"You and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,\" which is really Joanne saying, \"I have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?\"Here's one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there's a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly \"dies\" when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry thatisn't, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily's protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I'M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I'M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain't seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I'm going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is \"get in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.\"AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped.either that or this book was garbàge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request. (the whole contract is fine print.)ah jesus. you guys thought you hated me before.review to comeeeeee-------------------------me waiting for this book to be over"

Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves,the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneaksomething tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley's computer, or put on the television and flicked through thechannels to his heart's content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling toremember those times; it was like remembering a younger brotherwhom he had lost.ثم موت هيدويج..والذي لا اعتقد ان هاري وحده شعر بالحزن لذلك بالتأكيد كلنا شعرنا به لذكرياتنا معها و نجحت المؤلفه في تعميق ذلك الاحساس باخر مشاهدها في برايفت درايف. وان كنت احسب للفيلم تعميق دورها بهذه الطريقههنا ستشعر بالمعني الذي تقدمه المؤلفه والنادر تقديمه في روايات تصنف بنفس النوعيةComing of Ageستكون كهاري واصدقاءه..تشعر بكم المسئوليه عليهم ..توديعهم للطفوله والمراهقه للالتفات للمسئوليه الكبيره الواقعه عليهم كي يتغلبوا علي المحن والقهر الواقع عليهم وعلي كل من حولهموتبدأ

في \"دمبلدور\" والذي بوفاته صار الكثيرون يشككون فيه وفي توجههاته و اسلوبه وحياتهيبدأ يشك ان دمبلدور لم يكن يثق فيه ولم يعلمه بما فيه الكفايه ولم يمنحه ما يساعده في المهمه التي القي بحملها علي عاتقه قبل وفاته ..فيتسأل هل كان حقا يهتم به ام انه تركه للمجهول دون مساعده واضحه كما صار الكثيرين يتهمونه بذلك..تركه ليهلك دون مساعدههل حقا كان وقت شبابه يبحث عن ان يحكم بالقوه؟يحكم في ان يكون هو ومن مثله

للحكام..انظر الي كتاب \"حياه واكاذيب دمبلدور \" للصحفيه الكاتبه الرهيبه ريتا سكيتر...انظر كيف حولت احداث تاريخيه وقامت بتفسيرها علي اهوائها مما يؤدي لزعزعه الايمان في الرمز المتمثل في دمبلدورمما لا شك

المؤلفه بذكاء كيف ان السحر لا يجلب لك الطعام من لا شئ-القوه والبحث عنها حتي وان كان للخير الاعظم لم يكن من الحكمه ابدا..دمبلدور كان خير مثال لذلكوعاما قالت جي كي رولينج وقت انتهائها من الروايه انها

من السهوله ان تقتنع ان بطل قصه يسير الي هلاكه..موته ..حتي وان كان يعلم انه حتميا بكل ثقه وهو يشعر انه يفعل الواجب عليه؟من اصعب حبكات الدراما والتي دائما ما يقع فيها الادباء عندما يقدم البطل نفسه للموت..دائما ما يكون الامر سطحيا ويبتعد كثيرا عن الواقعالا ان الامر ليس هكذا ابدا في هذه الحاله..في هذه الروايه العبقريهان المؤلفه اختارت للجزء الاخير تيمه الموت..وهذا ما كان واضح ايضا من كل الرموز التي قدمتها حتي الدينيه منها والتي لاول مره تفصح عن توجهاتها الدينيه.هاري كان خائفا من الموت..كبشر طبيعي وليس كبطل..كان يذهب للقاء الموت وهو يتمني ان يراه احد ويوقفه..كان يفكر في شئ واحد,هل سيؤلمه الموت؟ نعم هو ذاهب ليموت ولكنه لا يستطيع كتمان خوفه..هذه-بالاضافه لكل الروعه في رسم الشخصيه- جعلت لهاري روح ونبض بكلماتها الذكيه ..لهذا تشعر ان فعلا جي كي رولينج يجب ان تلقب كملكه الروايههاري ما زال هاري..مازال يتعلم من اخطائه..مازال كما وصفه دمبلدور في الفصل قبل الاخيرHot Head راسه حاميلم يكن ملاك باي حال من الاحوال..ولكنه كان بشرياكل الشخصيات في الروايه كانت تستكمل دورها بكل سلاسه لم يكن هناك تجاوزات او اشياء غير متوقعه ..ربما كانت خفيه لنا بذكاء وحنكه ..وأؤكد انه اذا تم اعاده قراءه الاجزاء كلها مره اخري ستكتشف ان ليس بالامر اي خدعه..كل مافي الامر هو ان المؤلفه نجحت بعبقريه شديه اخفاء ما تريد من الشخصيات لاظهارها في وقت لاحقكذلك بالنسبه للدوافع التي تختلف بحسب المواقف التي تقع فيها الشخصيات , مثلا عائله مالفوي ودوافعها, دافع هاري عند عودته لهوجوارتس والذي لم يكن من اجل المحاربه في ذلك الوقت.لا اعتقد - من وجهه نظري- ان المؤلفه افسدت روح شخصيه او خيبت املنا في اي حدث من احداث الروايهومن اجمل المواقف في الروايه هو المواجهه الاخيره بين هاري وفولدمورت.. والذي يدعوه فيها للندم علي كل من قتله..الندم علي افعاله في روحه التيقسمها وارواح الاخرين التي ازهقها\"You're right. But before you try to killme, I'd advise you to think about what you've done. . . . Think, andtry for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\"\"What is this?\"Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this.

Try forsome remorse. . . .\"حتي هنا الامر ليس غريب علي هاري , وليس غريب علي فولدمورت رد فعله عنهاما عن سناب..فبما اني قرأت الروايات مره ثانيه فاني اؤكد ان من المستحيل ان يتم التشكيك ان نهايه شخصيته كانت ملفقه او بها خدعه..الشخصيه مرسومه بكل دقه من اول ظهور لهالنهايه*******لن يكون هناك نهايه لما اريد ان اقوله حول سلسله هاري بوتر..اعتقد اني يجب ان اعيد كتابه الريفيوهات من الجزء الاول حتي استطيع كتابه كل ماتستحقه السلسلههي سلسله انصح اي من لم يقراها او استكفي بمشاهده الفيلم البدء فيها , فهي ستغير مفهومك عن الروايات..لن تجد مثل ذلك الخيال الواقعي,الشخصيات التي تنبض عبر الصفحات, الاحداث الشيقه التي تدخلك فيها دخول هاري بوتر لمذكرات توم ريدل في الجزء الثاني :)محمد العربيالنسخه العربيه من 25 يناير 2008الي 30 يناير 200814/01/16: ورحل عن عالمنا المبدع الذي جسد شخصية بروفيسور سناب بمنتهي الأتقان, الان ريكمان"

It's tough to pick a favorite from the group, but the Deathly Hallows is a worthy contender for that coveted first spot. As the dark tension that began growing at the finish of the Goblet of Fire has come full circle, I felt this was the perfect finale to a (rightfully) highly acclaimed series. I'm so happy to have finally experienced first hand this beloved story arc that so many readers hold dear to their heart. I'm already trying to figure out when I can reread them. 😭 Now, on to our annual Christmas time watching of the films while we wrap presents! 😍———Gulp.This was my PIFM choice for the month of November in the A Good Thriller group here on Goodreads. I can't believe its finally time for my first read through of the Harry Potter books to come to an end, but I'm also dying to read this one and see how it compares to the film."

I did. The Prince's Tale gets to me every time. The epilogue seems to belong to Cursed Child more than to Deathly Hallows, but J.K. Rowling is only human."

        "user_review": "After watching 20th anniversary of my all time best fantasy series( feeling sorry for both Roberts and Watson), I chose the last book to return back to the universe for saying see you soon to my favorite characters.Even though the book is slow burn, I didn't mind as long as I already know where it goes. It might be my fourth time read and I'm so sure it won't be last!So many people may think why we connect with HP books so deeply? My answer is it awakens different feelings that change at each people. For me: it brings out so many complex feelings: an emotional trip in memory lane that reminds of my excitement at each time I start a new book of the series. Hope, sadness, fear always blended. Seeing my favorite characters' growing up, making mistakes, choosing their paths and evolving are the best things I've witnessed!The entire final book focuses on Harry's teaming up with his friends- more like family- Ron and Hermione to finish the task Dumbledore gave them.The ending of the book gives us the epic final that has been promised from the beginning. Its big screen adaptation truly reflected the terror, emotional breakdowns, excitement of the conclusion even though making two additional movies from one book was not the best idea!Prisoner of Azkaban is gonna be my favorite book of the series( the author's significant walk to the dark side and Harry's big discovery about his godfather) but it was still great to have fourth tango with the final book of the series!I think it's time for me head out Universal Studios to visit Hogswart and have a thrill ride for showing my tribute to this strongest installment of the century!Let's see my favorite quotes;\"It is the quality of one's convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.\" —Remus Lupin\"No, Harry, you listen,' said Hermione. 'We're coming with you. That was decided months ago — years, really.'\"\"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\"It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.\" — Albus Dumbledore\"All was well.\""

        "user_review": "First of all, It's awesome finding out that this book is Dedicated specially to you by the Queen herself -for me Joanna Rowling is the English Queen for Magic, just as there's a Queen for muggles- & it's Really yours personally..If you Stuck With Harry Until The Very End.I've been stuck with Harry myself for 10 years now..when I first read the Arabic edition of the 1st book on Sep.2003.. I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other HomeI finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever.Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter SagaThe Plot********Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling?**Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it.**And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape.**How he can do all that without Dumbledore , Black and all of those he can't tell about his quest as Dumbledore ask him to not tell but to Ron and Hermione.We all thought it will be difficult to fit it all in one last volume ,and to wrap up characters and events.But the amazing plot of that book didn't only fit for that all. and also add a new element \"The Deathly Hallows\" and fit it perfectly into the full story..I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying \"Voldemort\"'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters**************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no \"new\" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the \"real responsibilities\" that comes with the coming of age.or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any \"Exaggeration\" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawnThe Message***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.ِِAnd look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER\"You're right. But before you try to killme, I'd advise you to think about what you've done. . . . Think, andtry for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\"\"What is this?\"Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harrysaw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyeswhiten.\"It's your one last chance,\" said Harry, \"it's all you've got left. . . .I've seen what you'll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try forsome remorse. . . .\"It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some.It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of LoveSo glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real lifeThank you Joanna Rowling.Mohammed Arabey16 April 20132 May 2013 \"Harry Potter International Day\"****On That Day 2nd May 1998 ,The Battle of Hogwarts and Lord Voldemort's downfall .Happy 15th Anniversary..14/01/16R.I.P Alan Rickman..one of the greatest talented actors ever,here's his last farewell for a character he made so real..Oh God, And that's even Sadder...:("

I liked that.but the newspaper articles about the backstory was boring. & the part before the main story begins, & the camping-no-clues part, without anything interesting (or useful) happens were slow.This is the most emotional book in HP series; from the beginning. maybe the most crying book of my whole life:I cried at first, 25%, in the middle, later in the middle, in 75% & many times toward the end:Hedwig's death, Kreacher's tale & Regulus' bravery & kindness & acts trying to make his mistake right (why if my fav character is not the main hero, they ended up already dead?!😭 James & Regulus), the scene of James & Lily's death was very emotional, especially at the end when little Harry found out something was wrong, Luna's room, even cried (a bit tho) for wormtail, Dobby's death, many Deaths in the battle of Hogwarts😭 the Forest again; how he felt about Life when it was going to an end, his courage to face the his destiny... & Always (I liked Snape just because he made hard times for Harry. (ahhhh Evil me!) although I can't forgive Snape as Harry did; but this part was very emotional & he turned out to be a hero.)sobbing & curling in the corner. (I am even crying now as I'm just typing these.)always crying; at all the readings.also Stephen Fry narrating was amazing; made me cry even more & also at the last 40%.All his emotions not just in quotes, but in Harry's thoughts, memories & feelings, all their tones, all parts their voices broke, shattered or trembled, now very very tangible & more realistic. (better than my imagination; also Harry's voice is exactly the voice I always heard in my head reading the books.)I love this book!I think in my 7th read, I cried even more over my most crying book.(I mean, I cried all over the 'forest again' chapter & the last sentences made me completely burst into tears.)don't worry, it has fun times too.the ending was brilliant! mysteries solved! (& I'm mad about changing it in the movie!)epic battle!I had kinda subconsciously known before I read it for the first time that where the end battle would be. it just made sense that way. back Home one last time, defend Hogwarts.\"Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known.\"(I mean can you imagine the battle between Harry & Voldemort after he destroyed all the horcruxes happening in like an unknown nowhere land or something?-nope, right? XD)Romione & then Harry's reaction was priceless!and the Flaw in the Plan....One of my favourite chapters in the whole HP! I love the last battle. I love the way Harry explained it. (confident! courageous! sassy! taunting!) the clues even I, as a reader, might have missed. (at least in the first read I did. that's the whole point of a story being a legend, you don't see the clues wrapping up in the story until it's explained & next times you re-read it, you'll see them.)I can read those last 3 chapters over & over again.so exciting! so epic! so brilliant! (& they CHANGED that in the movies! How DARE they!?)I was at the edge of my seat for the last 30%. all of it. in most of my readings. so thrilling! never gets old!Harry is smart & brave.& I love the epilogue. fun & great.2021 May:now I can say I read the whole HP series 10 times, yay! until next time!& at my first read, I was afraid about how the story would be ended (because Harry is my favourite character) & this was my first series (no experience, no reader prediction ability, etc, etc.& I thought he must die (& at that time, I didn't have a clue he was\"you-know-what\". I just thought the story only ended when Harry dies. (actually I was afraid series only ended when the hero dies in General, so that way no other books would come out.) I'm actually thinking I was kind of right at some points. I'm surprised!but you know...All was well..\"Of course it is happening inside your head, Reader, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\"-World building: ★★★★★/5Characters: ★★★★★/5/ Characters development: ★★★★★/5Written style: ★★★★★/5/ feelz: ★★★★★/5plot: ★★★★/5General idea: ★★★★★/5-my edit of my feelings about this epic story with Queen's quote:"

Notjustthe books, but we kinda agedwithhim(or thereabouts). It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters.And wewerethere together. We were atmidnight release partiesand movie theaters, lined up and excited to share in the adventure. I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, andtheme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well."

Rowling shows us that even the nastiest of people deserve a degree of sympathy. Draco's story was more complex than we realised. He was never the person he secretly wanted to be: a good man.3.This scene was written superbly, the saddest moment of the series for me."

He accepts that he must die and understands that there are far worse things in the living world than dying.\"-Albus DumbledoreTo you, yes you, reader of this review, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews you'll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so don't tell me you haven't been warned.^^ToJ.K. Rowling,there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can't praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you're still human and surely you've recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can't blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death ofFred!. Why? Why kill him? Haven't you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don't think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don't the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don't you thinkProfessor Severus Snapedeserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened toProfessor Moody'sbody? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn't shed a tear. I just wish I read your books beforeAllegiantandMockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings.To Harry Potter, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.To Hermione Granger, you are the most kick-ass heroine I've ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest.To Ron Weasley, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.To Fred and George, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you.George, it's hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*To Hagrid (and Graupy), *hugs* I'll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.To Professor Snape,you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore's Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails*To Professor Dumbledore, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving.To Dumbledore's Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,, you guys are awesome!To the Order of the Phoenix,you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I'm so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much.To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant!To the Malfoys,uh I don't know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you!To Dobby,*wails* I can't…just thank you so much. You're the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know.To Kreacher,you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle.To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback, I have two words foryou. \"AVADA KEDAVRA!\"To Umbridge,off to Azkaban, you go!To Voldemort, that's right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?To the rest of the fallen,Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others, like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails*To the movie makers and actors, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'mHouse Gryffindor, hurray!I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.ToJiaandKyra, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends(March 06 is their actual birthday). You are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages. Savor that gift and seize your most special day! <3"

        "user_review": "Finished this book about a month ago but it's taken me this long to write a review about it because I have such mixed feelings about it. It was a deeply affecting novel, but mostly not in a good way. I really wanted to like it, but the more I think about what I didn't like about the book, the more it bothers me. I even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time I started writing it to the time I finished.Let's start off with the good, shall we? The writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description, in that I really felt the author's descriptions of scenes, and in terms of moving the story forward. That said, it's not particularly challenging writing to read.The very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of Afghanistan, and how it conveys the picture of a real Afghanistan as a living place, before the coup, the Soviet invasion, and above all, the Taliban and the aftermath of September 11th created a fossilized image in the US of a failed state, petrified in \"backwardness\" and locked in the role of a villain from central casting.Now for the not so good.== Spoiler Alert ==... because I don't think I'm going to be able to complain about what I didn't like about the book without revealing major plot points. (Not to mention, some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book.) So if you don't want to spoil it for yourself, read no further, here be spoilers:My overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated. Of course, one major reason for this is that the author's attempts at metaphor, allegory, and forshadowing are utterly ham-fisted. When he wants to make a point, he hits you over the head with it, hard -- Amir's split lip / Hassan's cleft palate comes immediately, resoundingly to mind.But I feel manipulated beyond that. The members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic, unspeakable calamities, sometimes at the hands of our fine hero, and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the \"wronged\" privileged child, beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others. How, why, am I supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others? Rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who, through absolutely no fault of their own, must suffer, not just once or twice, but again and again?Of course this elevation of / identification with the \"wounded\"/flawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs, wants, desires, pleasures -- their own selves, in fact -- to the needs of their masters. (Even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance, heartlessness, or downright stupidity.)I don't see how the main character, Amir, could possibly be likeable. Amir's battle with Assef, momentous as it is, is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must. Rather, he acts with very little self-agency at all -- he is more or less merely carried forward into events. (And, moreover, in the end it is Sohrab (Hassan again) who saves him.)I finished the novel resenting Amir, and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think she's supposed to care about Amir, more than about anyone else in the story.A couple other points: I'm wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings, no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption. Because Amir's moral \"triumph\", such as it is, over Assef, is so short-lived. He manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later, when he goes back on his word to Sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage.And lastly, I don't understand why Baba's hypocrisy is not more of a theme. He makes such a point of drilling into his son's head that a lie is a theft of one's right to the truth. His own hipocrisy there is a profound thing, and it's a shame the author doesn't do more with it.Nevertheless, after all the bad things I had to say about it, I do have a couple quotes worth keeping:\"Every woman needed a husband. Even if he did silence the song in her.\" (p.178)\"'That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You'vealwaysbeen a tourist here, you just didn't know it.'\" (p. 232)=== UPDATE ===I originally posted my reviewThe Kite Runnerin February 2008. Since then, my review has generated a very robust response from other Goodreads members. I have responded a couple of times in the comments section, but I realize that by now, the comments section has gotten long enough that some folks may not realize that I have added some clarifications to my review. So, although the extended reply that I posted in the comments section in October 2008 is still available in the comments section, I am re-posting it here, so people don't miss it.I also want to offer my continued thanks to those who have read, liked, and/or comment on my review ofThe Kite Runner.This kind of back-and-forth conversation on books is exactly why I signed on to Goodreads! I appreciate the feedback, and look forward to engaging in more such discussion.Finally, one more quick reply. One recent commenter asked how I could have given this book only a 1 star rating, if I was so affected by it. As I replied in the comments, the short answer is that I am guided by Goodread's prompts when I rate a book. Two stars is \"It was OK;\" 1 star is \"I didn't like it.\" While I have praised a few things about the book, the bottom line is, overall, I didn't like it. -- Linda, 22 July 2011Posted 24 October 2008:There have been many comments to my review since I first wrote it, and I thought it might be about time for me to weigh in for a moment.Before I get into my response, I must start off with a great thank you for all those who have felt sufficiently moved (positively or negatively) by my review to comment and respond. I appreciate all the comments, whether I agree with them or not.First of all, I'd like to address the question of whether we're \"supposed\" to like Amir or not. Yes, I do realize that sometimes writers create and/or focus on a character that the reader is not meant to like. Here, though, the story is clearly meant to be about some kind of redemption -- but I found Amir so distasteful, that I simply wasn't interested in his redemption. The focus of the story was entirely on how Amir's life had been corrupted by the despicable things he'd done - when the things he'd done were entirely part and parcel of the position of power and privilege he occupied over Hassan.Which brings me to my second point, the insufferable current of paternalism that runs throughout the story. The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters. Regardless of what terrible things befall them, they are shown to have nothing but their masters' interests at heart. Granted, it may be unlikely that the powerless would be overtly talking back and setting their masters straight; however, the novel gives no indication that they even have any private wishes of recrimination, or much of a private life, for that matter. Given this portrayal, it is even more difficult for me to muster any interest in Amir's suffering. But to suggest that perhaps we're misinterpreting the servants' subservient attitudes because we approach the story from a different time, place, or culture, is simply to engage in a cultural relativism borne out of -- and perpetuating -- the very same paternalism.To clarify my point, let's look at some comparable examples from US culture. Consider any one of a huge number of films such asDriving Miss Daisy,Clara's Heart,Bagger Vance, orGhost(all simply continuing a tradition that reaches back to Shirley Temple's days) in which noble servants or similar helpers have absolutely no concern in their lives other than making sure the wealthy people they are serving have happy, fulfilled lives -- while they themselves never seem to have any of their own personal hopes, desires, triumphs, tragedies, or even any hint of a home, family, personal, or romantic life at all. Their total happiness is bound up entirely with serving the lives of their rich counterparts. It is this quality, present throughout Hosseini's book, that bothers me most.In the end, however, a beautifully written story could have overcome these criticisms -- or at the very least, I would have been able to temper or counter my points above with lavish praise for the writing. However, here, again, the novel falls flat. It is not particularly well-written. As some other commenters have also pointed out, the storytelling is quite heavy-handed, and the narrative suffers from implausible plot twists and uncanny coincidences, and a writing style that relies far too heavily on cliches and obvious literary devices.I wish that I could say I liked the book more. To answer [another commenter's] question, I haven't readA Thousand Splendid Suns; I'm afraid I wasn't particularly motivated to do so after my reaction to this one. However, I do believe, as that commenter also suggests, that there is something to be gained from the debate and discussion that the book has inspired."

        "user_review": "In 2012, when I was Mathematics teacher at a private high school in Iran, I had an Afghan student in my class. Sometimes, I discussed with my students about literature, and I told them of novels and poem. I found it very strange that my students had no interest in literature and even sometimes looked with hostility to this discussion. Days passed and much time was left to the end of school year. One day I saw Ali, Afghan student, came to me and had a booklet in his hand and I saw in his eyes several times as if he wanted to say something, but he was quiet. I waited for a little, and after a few moments, I began to speak. He smiled, and with a special Afghan accent, he said \" I have written a story, sir \" and became quiet again. I said \"it's excellent! \", and I asked, \"do you read books? \". Yes, sir, he replied. I asked, \"what kind of books do you like? \". Mark Twain and John Steinbeck and Jules Verne, he answered. I asked what you have written? He replied I wrote a story about a 13 years old Afghan boy who immigrated to Iran. I got his booklet, and I read it in a week. It was a dark story. A week later, we discussed again after class. Ali invited me to go his house at night for reading books. I was pleased, and I greeted this plan. When night arrived, I took the kite runner and went to Ali's home. When I entered the house, I saw a house with mud walls that has no rooms, except a small hull that there was a table in the middle of it and almost nine children were dining. Of clothes of Ali's father, it was obvious that he was a building worker and he welcomed me very sincerely. I thanked him, and I went to the storehouse in the corner of the yard that Ali had made it, a place to be alone. Ali took the book and with incredible passion began to read. This process was repeated almost every night for a week, and we have read half of the Kite Runner. Among pages of the book, Ali informed me about Afghanistan, explained of how twenty people, entered Iran with a small car, illegally and secretly. Of how his classmates ridiculed him because of his Afghan accent, of how he was forced to work in a brick burner factory all days after the school, of how his dad has forced him to marry at the age of 13 in the summer. Then Ali proceeded to speak that he wants to be a writer and prizes the Nobel award. I saw in his room that he had Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Hafiz and Rumi's book poem. When I looked at his face, I saw an unusual man who was ahead of his time and situation. Ali said, because Afghans have been banned of the registration in public schools in Tehran, he is forced to register in a private school, and now he and his mother must work hard to pay school charges.The next week, I went to class, but I didn't see Ali. When I asked the guys about him, they replied that because his father hadn't citizenship card and passport, he was arrested, and all of them have deported to Afghanistan. I was agitated that I couldn't continue reading Kite Runner never. Even I felt so depressed and sad when I saw the book in bookstores. Until this spring, after three years, I got a message in WhatsApp messenger from Ali, that congratulated teachers day to me. He was written that he married to a girl who was in love with her and they have a two months old girl baby. He was written he is working at a bookstore in Kabul and he has read almost thousand books in three years. He was written they have the 4G Internet in Kabul and I replied him, it's supposed to we have 4G in Tehran as well, soon! When I received the message, I could reread the Kite Runner. It was a great book, especially for me, recall nostalgia of tired immigrants and unfavorable circumstances.*************************************سال 1391 زمانی که معلم ریاضی حق التدریس یه دبیرستان خصوصی شده بودم یه دانش اموز افغان هم سر کلاس داشتم ..هرازگاهی به بهونه های مختلف بحث رو به ادبیات میکشوندم و از رمان و شعر برای بچه ها میگفتم .. برام خیلی عجیب بود که بچه های کلاس هیچ علاقه ای به ادبیات نشون نمیدادن و گاهی حتی با دید تمسخر هم به قضیه نگاه میکردن.. روزها میگذشت و زمان زیادی به پایان سال تحصیلی باقی نمونده بود.. یک روز بعد از پایان کلاس دیدم علی محصل افغان , اومد کنار میز من و تووی دستش یه دفترچه داشت و تووی چشاش دیدم که چندبار انگار میخواست حرفی بزنه اما سکوت کرد.. کمی صبر کردم و بعد از چند لحظه سر صحبت رو باز کردم.. لبخند زد و با لهجه افغانی خاصش گفت \"اقا من یه داستان نوشتم \".و سکوت کرد.. گفتم خیلی عالیه.. پرسیدم. کتاب هم میخونی? گفت اقا بله..گفتم چی میخونی? جواب داد مارک تواین و جان اشتاین بک و ژول ورن.. گفتم چی مینویسی ..جواب داد یه رمان نوشتم درباره یه پسر سیزده ساله افغان که به ایران مهاجرت کرده. دفترچه رو از علی گرفتم و تووی یک هفته خوندم. داستان غمگین بود. یک هفته بعد دوباره بعد از کلاس با هم صحبت کردیم. علی من رو دعوت کرد که شبها به خونه شون برم و کتاب بخونیم. خب خیلی از این پیشنهاد خوشحال شدم و استقبال کردم. شب کتاب بادبادک باز رو برداشتم و رفتم . وارد خونه که شدم دیدم یه خونه با دیوارهای کاهگلی که هیچ اتاقی نداره بجز یه پذیرایی که وسطش یه سفره انداخته بودن و هشت نه تا بچه کوچیک داشتن غذا می خوردن. پدر علی که از لباسهاش مشخص بود یه کارگر ساختمونی هست با گرمی خاصی از من استقبال کرد. من تشکر کردم و با علی رفتیم به سمت انباری کوچیکی که گوشه حیاط بود و علی از اون یه جایی برای تنها بودنش درست کرده بود. علی کتاب رو از من گرفت و با شعف خاصی مشغول خوندن شد.. تقریبا یک هفته هر شب این جریان تکرار می شد و ما نیمی از بادبادک باز رو خونده بودیم. علی لابلای صفحه های کتاب برام از افغانستان میگفت از این که چطور بیست نفر با یه سواری وارد ایران شدن ازینکه چطور بچه های کلاس اون رو بخاطر لهجه افغانی مسخره میکنن از این که عصرها بعد از مدرسه مجبوره تووی کارگاه اجر پزی کار کنه. از اینکه پدرش مجبورش میکنه که تابستون تووی سیزده سالگی ازدواج کنه.. بعد علی ادامه داد دلش میخواد نویسنده بشه و جایزه نوبل بگیره. توی اون انباری کوچیک دیدم که شاهنامه و خیام و حافظ و مولوی هم داره.. میگفت حافظ رو از بر داره و خیام رو هم.. و من توی اون نگاهش یه پسر شریف رو می دیدم که خیلی از زمان و محیط خودش جلوتر رفته بود. علی گفت چون توی مدارس دولتی نامنویسی افغانها ممنوعه مجبور شده توی یه دبیرستان خصوصی درس بخونه و حالا خودش و مادرش برای تامین این هزینه مجبورن کار کنن.. هفته بعد که باز سر کلاس رفتم علی رو ندیدم. وقتی پرسیدم بچه ها گفتن که چون پدرش کارت نداشته گرفتنش و همشون رو فرستادن افغانستان. اونقدر ناراحت شدم که دیگه سمت بادبادک باز نرفتم. حتی دیدن کتاب تووی شهرکتابا غمگینم میکرد.. تا اینکه بهار امسال بعد از سه سال پیامی از علی تووی وایبر رسید که روز معلم رو تبریک گفته بود.. نوشته بود با دختری که دوستش داره ازدواج کرده و یک دختر دوماهه داره. نوشته بود حالا در یه کتابفروشی توی کابل کار میکنه و توی این سه سال هزارتا کتاب خونده.نوشته بود ما اینجا تووی کابل اینترنت نسل چهارم داریم. براش نوشتم قراره نسل چهارم بزودی به ایران هم برسه! با رسیدن پیام علی باز تونستم به بادبادک باز نزدیک بشم .کتاب خوبی بود.. مخصوصا برای من یاداور غربت مهاجرای خسته و ناسازگاری روزگار..."

        "user_review": "This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly. Just like the spate of Native American pop fiction in the late eighties, this is overwhelmingly colonized literature, in that it pretends to reveal some aspect of the 'other' culture, but on closer inspection (aside from the occasional tidbit) it is a thoroughly western story, firmly ensconced in the western tradition.Even those tidbits Hosseini gives are of such a vague degree that to be impressed by them, one would have to have almost no knowledge of the history of Afghanistan, nor the cultural conflicts raging there between the Shia and Sunni Muslims, or how it formed asurrogate battlegroundfor Russia and the United States in the Cold War, or forColonial conflictsin the centuries before. Sadly, for all the daily news reports about Afghanistan, most people know very little of its history.Hosseini's story is thickly foreshadowed and wraps up so neatly in the end that the reader will never have to worry about being surprised. Every convenient coincidence that could happen, does happen. He does attempt to bring some excitement to the story with dramatized violence, but that's hardly a replacement for a well-constructed plot. He is also fond of forcing tension by creating a small conflict between two characters and then having them agonize over it for years, despite the fact that it would be easy to fix and the characters have no reason to maintain the conflict. And since the conflict does not grow or change over time, everything is quickly reduced to petty and repetitive reactions.He even creates a cliched 'white devil' character, a literal sociopath (and pedophile) as the symbol for the 'evils' of the Taliban. This creates an odd conflict in the narrative, since one of the main themes is that simple inequalities and pointless conflicts stem from Afghan tradition, itself. His indelicate inclusion of wealthy, beautiful, white power as the source of religious turmoil in the mid-east negates his assertion that the conflicts are caused by small-mindedness.The fact that this character seems to have the depth of motivation of a Disney villain also means that he does not work as a representation of the fundamental causes of colonial inequality, which tend to be economic, not personal. The various mixed messages about the contributors to the ongoing Afghan conflict suggest that Hosseini does not have anything insightful to say about it.Perhaps the worst part about this book is how much it caters to the ignorance of White America. It will allow naive readers to feel better about themselves for feeling sympathy with the larger mid-east conflict, but is also lets them retain a sense of superiority over the Muslims for their 'backwards, classicist, warlike' ways. In short, it supports the condescending, parental view that many Americans already have about the rest of the world. And it does all this without revealing any understanding of the vast and vital economic concerns which make the greater mid-east so vitally important to the future of the world.It is unfortunate that nowhere amongst this book's artfully dramatized violence and alternative praising and demonizing of the West is there the underlying sense of why this conflict is happening, of what put it all into place, and of why it will continue to drag us all down. The point where it could turn sympathy into indignation or realization is simply absent.There is a bad joke on the internet showing a map of the world with the mid-east replaced by a sea-filled crater with the comment 'problem solved'. What this map fails to represent is that there is a reason the Westkeeps meddlingin the affairs of the mid-east, and that every time we do, it creates another conflict--because almost every group who we decry as terrorists now were originally trained and armed by the US and Western powers to serve our economic interests.As long as we see extremists as faceless sociopaths, we can do nothing against them. We must recognize thatnormal people fall down these paths, and that everyone sees himself as being 'in the right'. Who is more right: the Westerner whose careless bomb kills a child, or the Muslim's that does?The point shouldn't be to separate the 'good Muslims' from the 'bad Muslims', because people aren't fundamentally good or bad. They are fundamentally people. Almost without exception, they are looking out for their future, their children, and their communities. Calling someone 'evil' merely means you have ceased to try understanding their point of view, and decided instead to merely hate because it's easier to remain ignorant than to try to understand.This book isn't particularly insightful or well-written, but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers. The problem is that Americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east. This book will make people feel better about themselves, instead of helping them to think better about the world.For an actually insightful, touching view of the Afghan conflict, I would suggest avoiding this bit of naive melodrama and looking up Emmanuel Guibert's'The Photographer'."

It is going to manipulate your emotions. It may include some random words in my native language for no reason whatsoever. It will teach you unnecessary things about my culture. It will not be smarter than a fifth grader. And it will include as many cliches and as much foreshadowing as is humanly possible.You are going to be shocked. I, for one, never saw it coming. So I doubt you will. Get ready. Aren't you so ready to be shocked? You're never going to see this coming.What comes next is the big revelation, so get ready!Wait, I need to ask you something first. Did you know that the Irish like potatoes? Yeah, we really enjoy them. And alcohol too. It's pretty great.Erin Go Bragh!This means Ireland Forever! Unfortunately, you will be very sad to know that my father just died due to an Irish car bomb. Well, about 15 of them to be exact. All on an empty stomach! It makes me sad and you should feel sad too, kind reader.Ok, on to the big reveal. Here it is:On that frigid overcast day, which happened to be the day that I decided to quit readingThe Kite Runner, I became a book snob.BecauseThe Kite Runneris adored by most people who read it, I am forced to conclude that most people need to read more. A whole lot more. You should be embarrassed if you like this book. Seriously. The moment I became a book snob (shortly after \"The Scene\"), I became so embarrassed to be seen reading it that I accused the guy sitting next to me on the subway of putting the book on my lap while I wasn't paying attention. \"How dare you, sir! Have you no decency?\" I exclaimed excitedly in my native language. Then I noticed a monkey on the platform waiting to board a train. I quickly hopped off my train, ran to him, handed him the book, and said \"Top O' the Mornin' to ya!Enjoy!\"Later that day, I saw that monkey flying a kite in front of the Washington Monument. I noticed that the glass string wasn't making his hands bloody. Do you know why? He was wearing gloves.---------------------------------------------------------------Please note that I have absolutely no appreciation for life and reality.**Bart Bondeson, who claims to be \"a better person for having read this book,\"suggestedthat I make this clarification to my review. Thanks for the suggestion, Bart! Hopefully that clears things up for those who were wondering."

        "user_review": "Sad stories make good books.\"I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975.\"There are two types of books, usually, that makes one feel like there are no words to describe the experience: They are either unbelievably detrimental, or exceptionally (and positively) impactful. Given the overall high rating, it is redundant to tell, to which category does The Kite Runner belong. I don't think there are that many books, especially fiction, that could leave such a profound effect on a reader's mind.\"People say that eyes are windows to the soul.\"\"Time can be a greedy thing - sometimes it steals all the details for itself.\"What I loved the most about this book is the set of characters. Hosseini has done an amazing job developing them, which increases the emotional impact of the plot tenfold. Especially, it's remarkable how well he handled the first person protagonist, Amir. The traditional 'do wrong, then atone, conclude with happy ending' is not the way with The Kite Runner, but utilizes an attempt to direct Amir towards a path of atonement, while sticking to a more realistic ending. Had it not been for Hosseini's unique narrative, Amir's character could have turned far more contemptible. Luckily, for me, it was never the case. Many would probably love the secondary characters more, but it is important to remember that it was the protagonist's undistorted, self-criticizing account of the events that made it that way. It's not a perspective you see everyday, but I loved it.\"It always hurts more to have and lose than not have in the first place.\"I was perfectly satisfied with the pace of the story, including the intermittent jumps in time Hosseini used to separate the book in to a few main parts. Each of these parts had their own theme going on, while introducing an occasional twist to keep things interesting. The only minor complaint I have is about the attempt at creating a villain. Even though it introduced a tiny bit of mystery to the plot, that particular part felt a little out of harmony with the rest.\"That's the real Afghanistan, Agha sahib. That's the Afghanistan I know. You? You've always been a tourist here, you just didn't know it.\"The writing style is somewhat simple, but I believe most readers would be too absorbed in the plot to notice it. If anything, it felt more appropriate, reducing distractions from the flow of the story. But the plot, and the characters make up perfectly for any other shortcoming in my opinion. I wouldn't call this an emotional rollercoaster, for, the majority of the emotions include regret, disappointment, sadness, fear, anger, privation but very little happy ones. But all this helped the book become more moving. I usually don't enjoy books with sad endings but this one was definitely an exception, and worth all the heartbreak.\"Better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.\"Before starting the book, based on almost all the reviews, I knew this was a sad story. But with fiction, if and when things get too depressing, a reader could always be consoled by the fact that this is, after all, fiction. It's easier attributing everything to being not real, and proceed from that safe spot. You're no going to find that solace here. If anything, unless we are fooling ourselves, the severity of reality has been lessened to make it more bearable. But I guess that's the whole point. That's what makes this deliver a profound reading experience. It enables all readers to understand, to empathize, and be considerate towards others. Kite Runner easily made it to my All-time-favorites and I believe this should be read by everyone.'For you, a thousand times over!' he said. Then he smiled his Hassan smile and disappeared around the corner."

Amir desperately wants his father's approval, but Baba is not quick to give it. He is a rich man, brimming with macho vibrancy, while his son is a different sort altogether. Amir is fast friends with Hassan, the son of his father's servant. They are as close as brothers. But, beset by bullies, an event occurs that changes Amir's life. There is much death and horror in this portrait of a tortured country. But there is also emotional richness, and a look into the inner life. By the end of the book there was not a dry eye in the house. It is recommended unreservedly. A wonderful tale, movingly told."

        "user_review": "Two little friends, an unspeakable secret, and a quest for redemption.\"Amir\" and \"Hassan\" are two little boys living in the peaceful Afghanistan of 1975, before the russian invasion, and the subsequent civil wars. Amir is the spoiled son of a wealthy and prominent merchant. Hassan is the cleft lipped son of an inferior caste, and a servant in the house they both live in. During their childhood they become fervent competitors in kite fighting tournaments, and unquestionable friends. Until one fateful day a traumatic event starts gradually separating them forever apart. Decades later, the dark secret that separated them so many years ago starts re-emerging. A secret that ends revealing long forgotten family betrayals, wars, and ethnic differences that led two little inseparable boys into very different life paths.A novel about the inherent strengths and weaknesses in each person, the guilts, and the terrible consequences of trying to endure them, or avoid them.Highly recommendable, very powerful, inexplicably painful. There are books that tell an unique unforgettable story, but there are a few special ones that also have the exceptional quality of transmitting something immensely valuable about the culture of a foreign country; beyond the deeply ideological differences, pros and cons you may find with such society. And, like I hold \"Shantaram\" as an unequalled novel about indian culture, I will hold \"Kite Runner\" as an inestimable novel about afghan. And I remain hopeful of ever finding books like these two, regarding any foreign culture.Few times I suffered so much with a book, but the level of suffering is a good measure of how much you strongly and deeply connected with said book. An infinity of quotes and moments to remember.Still remaining, the movie.-----------------------------------------------PERSONAL NOTE:[2003] [371p] [Historical] [Highly Recommendable][The bathtub scene <\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3]-----------------------------------------------Dos pequeños amigos, un secreto inconfesable, y una cruzada por la redención.Amir y Hassan son dos pequeños niños viviendo en la pacífica Afganistán de 1975, antes de la invasión rusa y las subsiguientes guerras internas. Amir es el hijo mimado de un prominente y rico señor comerciante, Hassan el hijo de labio leporino de una casta inferior y sirviente de la casa en la que ambos viven. Durance la infancia se vuelven fervientes competidores en torneos de lucha de barriletes y amigos incuestionables. Hasta que un fatídico día un hecho traumático termina gradualmente separándolos para siempre. Décadas después, el oscuro secreto que los separó tantos años atrás vuelve a resurgir. Un secreto que termina revelando olvidadas traiciones familiares, guerras y diferencias étnicas que llevó a dos pequeños niños inseparables por muy diferentes caminos de vida.Una novela sobre la fortaleza y la debilidad inherente en cada persona, sobre la culpa, y las terribles consecuencias de tratar de sobrellevarla, o evadirla.Muy recomendable, muy fuerte, inexplicablemente doloroso. Hay libros que cuentan una historia única e inolvidable, pero existen algunos muy especiales que además tienen la excepcional cualidad de trasmitir algo inestimable sobre la cultura de otro país; más allá de las profundas diferencias ideológicas, pros y contras que uno pueda ver en dicha sociedad. Y así como estimo a Shantaram como una novela inigualable sobre la cultura india, tendré a Kite Runner como un fruto inestimable de la cultura afgana. Y me mantengo esperanzado de encontrarme alguna vez con otras novelas como éstas dos, sobre cualquier cultura extranjera.Pocas veces sufrí tanto con un libro, pero la medida del sufrimiento es una buena medida de lo profundamente que conectaste y te llegó determinado libro. Infinindad de frases y momentos para el recuerdo.Queda pendiente la película.-----------------------------------------------NOTA PERSONAL:[2003] [371p] [Histórica] [Altamente Recomendable][La escena de la bañadera <\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3<\\3]-----------------------------------------------"

        "user_review": "\"When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing.\"I'm going to be honest with you. To read this book was a constant struggle, not because I didn't like the writing style, not because it was bad and not because it was boring. No, if anything\"The Kite Runner\"was so hard to read because it was so exceptionally painful.This book made me so sad! I felt helpless and angry and there were times I actually was more than just tempted to stop reading. Some of the chapters were just too hard to bear and the book touched me in a way I can't even describe. It did something with me… and I'm still not sure whether this was good or bad.All I know is that the injustice in this book made me furious and that I just have to think about it and already feel sick to my stomach again. There were so many serious topics in this book but I think what really got to me was the central theme of violence, injustice and abuse. To read \"The Kite Runner\" was so devastating and nerve-racking I actually couldn't read more than two chapters a day. It was so upsetting that I found it difficult to motivate myself to read it and even though this was such a painful read, I still wanted to know what would happen next.Amir's and Hassan's story was so horrible, appalling, powerful and beautiful at the same time. It left me completely broken and raw and I think my emotions are still all over the place. So if my review sounds a little incoherent and illogical you can blame it on the book hangover I'm currently suffering from. XD\"But we were kids who had learned to crawl together, and no history, ethnicity, society, or religion was going to change that either.The plot:Amir and Hassan are best friends who grew up together and live in Kabul. They do almost everything together and one of their favourite hobbies is kite running. One day there is a local kite-fighting tournament Amir is determined to win and with the help of Hassan he is even able to achieve his goal. The victory of the tournament comes with a high price though and in the end their moment of happiness isn't only short lived but also comes to an abrupt end. What happens after the competition destroys their lifelong friendship and shakes the foundations of their trust, the course of their lives changing as they try to deal with the repercussions of a single day.\"It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime, Amir,\" he said.The characters:Beware there are plenty of spoilers lying ahead of you!!!Amir:\"I pretended I was reading from the book, flipping pages regularly, but I had abandoned the text altogether, taken over the story, and made up my own. Hassan, of course, was oblivious to this. To him, the words on the page were a scramble of codes, indecipherable, mysterious. Words were secret doorways and I held all the keys.\"Puh, what to say about him? I think I never disliked a protagonist as much as I disliked the narrator of this story. I just couldn't stand his younger self and I thought he wasn't just egoistic but also spoiled and more than just unethical. The way Amir treated Hassan made me sick and his betrayal towards his best friend hurt so much! I mean how could he let this happen? How could he stand aside without intervening? How could he even think that Hassan is \"just a Hazara\"?! I don't understand it and if I'm entirely honest I really think that it was good he felt bad throughout the entire book! His past haunted him and in the end it actually made him a better person. A person that stood up to bad people and a person I was finally able to forgive. It was a long journey for Amir but he eventually did the right thing and when I read the finial sentences of this book I was even proud of him. XD\"It's all right.\" I turned to the general. \"You see, General Sahib, my father slept with his servant's wife. She bore him a son named Hassan. Hassan is dead now. That boy sleeping on the couch is Hassan's son. He's my nephew. That's what you tell people when they ask.\"They were all staring at me.\"And one more thing, General Sahib,\" I said. \"You will never again refer to him as a 'Hazara boy' in my presence. He has a name and it's Sohrab.\"I waited 331 pages for that to happen!!! XDHassan:\"Then Hassan did pick up a pomegranate. He walked toward me. He opened it and crushed it against his own forehead. 'There,' he croaked, red dipping down his face like blood. 'Are you satisfied? Do you feel better?' He turned around and started down the hill.\"God bless his kind and innocent soul!!! This boy was an angel and I don't even know how he was able to forgive Amir. As it seems he managed to do it though and my deep respect and love for his character will never cease. I loved Hassan with all my heart and I think his only flaw was that he was just too good to live in this sick and violent world. He would have deserved so much more than life gave him and when I found out about Sohrab's ordeal I was more than just heartbroken.I was devastated!!!I know Hassan must have turned over in his grave and I felt so, so, so damn sorry for what happened to both of them.Baba:\"The problem, of course, was that Baba saw the world in black and white. You can't love a person who lives that way without fearing him too. Maybe even hating him a little.Baba definitely was a very flawed character but I still couldn't help but had to love him for it. There was so much good in him, yet he also had his bad sides. For a person that was described as seeing the world in black and white he actually was all different kinds of grey and in some way that made him extremely likeable and disagreeable at the same time. *lol* I think he was a very contradictory person and after finding out about his secret I was finally able to understand why. Still, I loved that despite everything he tried to be a righteous man and when it comes down to it he certainly had his heart in the right place.\"Ask him where his shame is.\"They spoke. \"He says this is war. There is no shame in war.\"\"Tell him he's wrong. War doesn't negate decency. It demands it, even more than in times of peace.\"\"And now, fifteen years after I'd buried him, I was learning that Baba had been a thief. And a thief of the worst kind, because the things he'd stolen had been sacred: from me the right to know I had a brother, from Hassan his identity, and from Ali his honor. His nang. His namoos.\"Sohrab:This boyB.R.O.K.Emy heart and I don't even know how I'm supposed to pick up the pieces. He was just ten!! Damn it!! I don't understand how people can hurt children and I can't even… *argharghsdfjklmno* I hate what Assef did to him and I'm so glad Sohrab got away from his clutches! Chapter 22 was so horrible to read… It made me sick to my stomach and I swear I was tempted to throw the book against a wall… Urgh… just to think about his hands on Sohrab… My heart aches so much for that little boy!!! He deserved a better childhood than that! Damn no!! He actually deserved a childhood to begin with!!!!\"I miss Father, and Mother too,\" he croaked. \"And I miss Sasa and Rahim Khan sahib. But sometimes I'm glad they're not … they're not here anymore.\"\"Why?\" I touched his arm. He drew back.\"Because –\" he said, gasping and hitching between sobs, \"because I don't want them to see me… I'm so dirty.\" He sucked in his breath and let it out in a long, wheezy cry. \"I'm so dirty and full of sin.\"And OMG that beautiful ending! That hopeful, amazing and beautiful ending! It killed me, it was the death of me, it was the final nail in my coffin!!! That sweet and gentle and shy boy!!!! XD I already get emotional just thinking about it! *blinking away tears*The bottom line:I hated the book! I loved the book!I hated the injustice, the pain Ali, Hassan and Sohrab had to go through, I hated the way the Taliban treated everyone they considered to be wrong and different, I hated to read about the destruction of Amir's hometown, I hated the violence, I hated the war, I hated to read about the many orphans, the hungry children on the street. I hated the way Amir acted when he was younger!!!\"She had a large purple bruise on her leg for days but what could I do except stand and watch my wife get beaten? If I fought, that dog would have surely put a bullet in me, and gladly! Then what would have happened to my Sohrab?\"But I loved the details about Afghan culture, I admired the bravery of Hassan and Baba, my heart sang whenever they tried to be righteous and good. In a world that had gone to hell they still tried to be decent, they still tried everything possible to stand up for their people, to do the right thing. They still had values and they didn't just believe in them, they also acted according to them!!!So yes, for me\"The Kite Runner\"was a very powerful book. It pushed my boundaries and forced me to fight through it! It made me think about unpleasant things, it forced me to see the bad and ugly things our world is made of, but it also showed me the good in people and their kindness!If you can live with a broken heart and are able to deal with the pain, this book his highly recommended. If you're one of the faint-hearted you better give it a wide berth.As for me, I definitely will never re-read this book ever again! I'm kind of proud that I accomplished to read it though! XD\"For you, a thousand times over.\""

Sometimes incidents you've read are extremely hard to absorb. You want to take a break, closing your book, gathering your composure to return back. The viciousness, unfairness, the tragedies shake you to the core, hurting you deeply as if tiny pieces of glasses are embedded under your skin.I think not any human being in this world can finish this book dry eyed. This is my third rereading and i cannot stop crying!Definitely A MUST READ! Powerful, provocative, dark, sad, heartbreaking, perfectly written! Best work of the author!"

        "user_review": "i really wanted to like this novel. judging from its thousands of 'five-star reviews' hailing it as the one of the 'best books ever written,' i'm in the minority when i state that this novel, while well-intentioned, just left a little bit of sour taste in my mouth.my problems with the novel are as follows: first of all the writing itself is so ham-fistened, heavy-handed, distracting and otherwise puzzling that by the midway point, i seriously considered chucking the book against the wall. each page of the novel has at least 5-10 incomplete sentences. i'm all for experimental and fractered prose--but it's important for authors to use it judiciously. hosseini, unfortunately, beats it to death. a lot of his language is cliched, too, which is funny considering there's a passage in the book about a writing teacher who warns the narrator, amir, about using cliches. i don't know if that was supposed to be funny or not, but it made me laugh (and what was worse was the san francisco's chronicle's glowing review on the book's cover and the san francisco chronicle's glowing review of amir's novel--coincidence?).the author's use of farsi--especially in the dialogue--was equally distracting. my point is that no one speaks the way his characters speak. people don't switch back and forth between languages while speaking, and if they do, they certainly don't speak 1/2 the sentence in english, say one word in farsi, then traslate the farsi word to english, then finish the sentence in english, when they're presumably speaking farsi to begin with. i didn't pick up this book for a crash course in colloquial farsi. after 370 pages, i was frustrated--and annoyed.hosseini's plot often borders on the ridiculous. the'twists' are just TOO coincidental--and not surprising at all (except in how contrived they are). for example, in a devasted kabul, amir sees a homeless man in the street. the homeless man, of course, was a former university professor who just happened to teach with amir's long deceased mother. what a coincidence! what makes it worse, is that the narrator, amir then explains that while that may, in fact, seem like a coincidence, it happens in afghanistan happens all the time. of course it does. in another example, amir's former nemesis, assaf (now a taliban crony), beats up amir and amir ends up with a scar above his lip, just like his dear friend hassan, who was born with cleft-pallet. oh, the coincidence! (and the fact that amir even runs into assef again is ridiculous). another example: amir and his wife aren't able to have children, and of course they find an orphan boy who happens to be extended family and they adopt him. what a coincidence! and after amir returns to afghanistan he doesn't call home to his dutiful wife for over a month. i kept wondering 'when's he gonna call home?' and any plot advanced by a series of 'tragedies,' (and in this book they are legion) shows little more than the writer's inability to craft a meaningful and interesting plot. not only is it pretty poor form, it's also highly manipulative and condescending. i found myself continually frustrated by hosseini's apparent distrust of the reader. we don't have to be told how and when to interpret metaphors. and if i read one more book where the protagonist is a writer or professor, i'm gonna ram my head into a metal post.i don't want to sound like a misanthrope or jaded literature reader because i'm certainly not. this novel just left me wanting so much more in terms of plot and characterization. having said that, however, the novel could be important in that shows the cruelty of the taliban. much of what hosseini writes about is important, especially for us westerners unfamiliar with the breadth and scope of the afghani tragedy.in the end, it was worth the $2.00 i paid for it."

        "user_review": "Abuse, caste system, and invasion long time effectsDescribed in explicit detailThat´s one of the reasons the book first had problems with all audiences, Westerners, and different fractions of the Afghan people. It´s just totally in your face and doesn´t care about genre conventions regarding violence and especially sexual explicitness. The fact that that´s unacceptable in non democratic Afghan parties is understandable. But that first world people had problems with some heavy stuff is one more ridiculous overkill, especially because it uses the described atrocities toDenounce invasions, hierarchies, and sexual abuseThe cruelty of war is the most obvious problem everyone agrees upon, but what about status? No matter if it´s in a feudal medieval state, a caste system, or defined by socioeconomic power and thereby worth, dividing people by giving them different social positions is a game as old as time. And it works so well, everyone high in the ranks will use her/his big influence to concrete this power for eternity and all others are busy fighting to reach the top or just somehow survive. Thereby, they aren´t able to work together and realize the immense influence they could have as united citizens of a country or people of the world, and insteadHelp the 1 percent become even mightierThe Western US and EU model of doing as if there is a democracy and equality, while it´s in reality just an oligarchy of international megacorporations, military industrial complexes, and public private partnerships controlling all governments except for the rare eco social Nordic model ones, is even more ludicrous than pure caste systems. At least they honestly say that they believe in the hereditary, faith fueled, or traditional different worth of people. One of the most disturbing real life manifestations of this is how they deal withStrong sexual predatorsEveryone else is prey and they exactly know that nothing can happen to them. In industrialized countries, there is at least a small chance of a metoo wave and many speaking up after one dared to do so, although victim blaming, slut shaming, and perpetrator protection are often louder than the cries of the rape victims. In caste systems, it´s simply a kind of inherent right of alphas to do whatever their fetish is with everyone else in alphabetic order. All these elements are unitedTo describe the unnatural friendshipOf a high and a low ranking kid of a society. Besides great characterizations, the invasion pimping the plot, a detailed description of the Afghan society, and the mentioned deeper messages, innuendos, and connotations, their life is the essence of this outstanding novel. And there is no room for unrealistic fairytale tropes, happy endings, or justice in a country so grim, gruesome, and sadistic. The essence of the world humans love to create so much withSuperpowers playing chess with weaker nationsNo matter which country in the Southern hemisphere, Middle East, and Central Asia, they are all victims of neocolonialism, sometimes full scale military invasions and occupations, and everything the WTO, World Bank, and IMF throw at them in economic warfare experiments. But guess what, hypocritical and bigoted Europeans and US Americans prefer to be sad about the terrible things described in novels showing the consequences of exploitation, than to realize that their political and economic system is the reason for all the suffering.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "I liked this book a lot. Due to the uncomfortable nature of the story told, I'll probably never read it again, but I'm glad that I did read it once. I saw it as the story of one not very likeable boy growing up in a soon to be war torn region and his eventual struggle for redemption.I was quite surprised to see how popular some of the negative reviews of this book were and I'd like to comment on a few of the comments they contained.One condemnatory critic said \"This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly.\" Ah, if only that were truer. In a study done not long ago, over half of American adult men, when asked, admitted to having read NO books in the last year. Personally, as a white American, this book made me grateful that I grew up where I did, and once again reminded me of how good I've had it, and how little I really know about life outside these insular, isolationist, United States.Another critic claimed that this book \"...portrays Afghanistan as backward\" Personally I thought that it portrayed it as a war torn, deeply wounded country that was at one time a bit like our ante-bellum south. It was made quite clear that we saw pre-soviet Afghanistan through the eyes of a doubly privileged class, the rich child.Another critic claimed \"The members of the servant and poorer classes are consistently portrayed as saintly, absurdly self-sacrificing, one-dimensional characters.\" Yes, that's true. But the viewpoint is a that of an over-privileged, rich, selfish child. Given the ante-bellum south atmosphere that our protagonist sees, it's a wonder that the epithet \"uncle Tom\" wasn't used.Finally one critic complained \"The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban.\" Personally, I felt that while that need may be great, I didn't see that as the purpose of this book.I saw this book as the story of one man's journey toward redemption against a background of a troubled heritage. I sometimes recall doing things as a child that now makes me wonder about myself, and while I like to think I've become a better human being, I sometimes shudder at the savage, thoughtless child that was once under this skin. For the personal perspective alone, I think this book is a worthwhile, if sometimes uncomfortable, read. If you let it, it may make you a better person."

        "user_review": "The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini ( Berliani M. Nugrahani, Translator) is a 2004 Riverhead Books publication.Earlier this year I read Moloka'i by Alan Brennert, another book, like this one, written back in 2004. It seemed I was the only person in the world who had not read the book, and once I'd finished reading it, I wondered why it had taken me so long to read it. This got me to thinking about all the books that I'd intended to read, but never got around to. So, despite my strong feelings about making reading resolutions, I vowed to read more books 'the entire world has read but me'. Other than Moloka'I, I have also read 'The Handmaid's Tale\", and now- \"The Kite Runner\".The Kite Runner has over 68,000 reviews on Goodreads, so I'm not going to recap the synopsis, nor am I going to break down all the various ways in which this book touched me in one way or another, or analyze all the important messages in the story, as I don't think I can add anything more to what has already been said.However, I couldn't simply leave a rating and felt compelled to add a few personal remarks about my experience with this novel- but I'll keep it brief.First of all- why on earth did I wait so long to read this book?This story is an incredible gut-punching- heart-wrenching, powerful and very thought-provoking family saga.The juxtaposition between the two boys and the separate paths on which they embark is tragic, but eventually leads to long overdue penance and justice, as well as redemption and forgiveness. This riveting drama is very reflective, and handled with crisp precision, evoking a myriad of emotions. While the story is deeply depressing and so very sad, it is also an uplifting, inspirational story of a personal reckoning and redemption, which is the part of the story I'll always carry with me.I'm so very glad I took the time to finally sit down and read this book! Although the book is fifteen years old now, it still has the same profound resonance it did when first published. I'm still hugging my box of tissues!Amazing storytelling, amazing book- One I will never forget!"

Still, I will feel that it is not enough.The story of the extraordinary friendship between Amir and Hassan told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan will incontrovertibly move your heart and bring some tears to your eyes. If you are a person who reads only 5-6 books a year, this one should be at the top of your reading list."

        "user_review": "Check out more of my reviews atwww.bookaddicthaven.com'The Kite Runner' had been sitting on my TBR list for years. I kept putting it off because while I was sure that it would be a fantastic book, it isn't the type of smutty romance that I usually read. I knew that I'd have to be in the right kind of mood to read it. Finally, I found myself wanting to read something a little different to break me out of a reading rut and I downloaded the Audible version of 'The Kite Runner' and started listening.As expected, this book was nothing like my usual love stories. This book is the type of book that makes you think about your life and reevaluate your values and what you think you know. It is the type of book that makes you question what you'd do in a given situation if the tables were turned.If you're like me, and have always been blessed to live in a country where you've never experienced the brutality and terror of warfare firsthand, this book serves as a reminder of how lucky you truly are. As a woman, and a mother of two daughters, I cannot begin to express how grateful I am that I was born in a country where women are treated as equals. Sure, there are still some inequalities. However, when I think of how women are treated in many other regions of the world, I am incredibly thankful to have the freedoms that I do.I won't rehash this story, because it's been done a million times already and I don't think there's anything I could say that hasn't been said already. However, I will say that this was a wonderful book. It was grim, brutal and depressing, but also beautiful at times. It was emotional and infuriating, but you can't say that you didn't \"feel\" while reading this one. I experienced a full range of emotions.In the end, it grounded me and put all of my petty gripes into perspective. We all need to be reminded of how blessed we are at times. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for an emotional and enlightening story."

        "user_review": "I found this book a failure of courage and imagination -- all the more upsetting for the author's astute sense of detail and wonderful psychological depth. But ask yourself this: if the Taliban are real humans than why are they not represented as such? No doubt we will all love the movie as well.If you want to read a book on Afghanistan, I recommend Jason Elliot'sAn Unexpected Light.Below is my complete review:I started out loving this book. Hosseini is dead on target in his depiction of children's psychology, the non-contractual relationships between master and servant, and in his weaving of the threads between trauma, memory, and denial.Further, Hosseini captures the feel of life in a Third World country. His depiction of Afghanistan confirms my own short travels in Afghanistan during the 1970s. Indeed, I was becoming ever more excited with the possibility of teaching this book in my new course on Afghanistan. But alas.The book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed - in the depiction of the Taliban. When we do not have an archive, or the possibility of getting at the facts and narratives of a part of history, fiction can be used creatively and responsibly in order to construct something real. Take, for example, the extraordinary slave narrative written by Guy Endore --Babouk. After years of research, Endore writes a history of a slave engaged in rebellion just prior to the Haitian Revolution.Hosseini has the skills but not the courage nor the empathy/sympathy to portray the Taliban as historical, sociological, economic, modern creations. Discounting and trivializing his own skills, he characterizes the Taliban in the easiest way -- as simple, cartoonish, evil. He thereby does nothing to enlighten us. Worse, he panders to a sleepwalking liberal public who happily accept his vision as a seemingly authentic reflection of their own myopia.Most everyone is satisfied: the U.S. public for having read about a country they destroyed -- feeling all the better at having disposed of evil; the publishers for their timely profit; and Hosseini for having expressed his romantic sense of loss.At least V.S. Niapaul is honest about his hatred for his own people. Hosseini's twist is less forgivable -- he gives aide to the very people whose malice, neglect, ignorance, and misunderstanding of Afghan people is one key factor in the destruction of this beautiful land and vital people.A failure of imagination is often the result of a failure in will, in courage, in politics. Hosseini traps himself in the politics of nostalgia.(For a similar review with a more academic bent, please see:http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2..."

Maybe I was more interested in the subject of women's rights in Afghanistan and it made my sympathies with the main characters. I was moved by the women's struggle whereas the story of Amir failed to impress me.I have to be honest. I despised Amir from the first page and my feelings did not changed throughout the book. I know it should not be a reason for not appreciating a book and I agree with that when I read a literature masterpiece such as Hunger, The Trial or Crime and Punishment. However, here is not the case. In Khaled Hosseini books, if you are not touched by the characters, the magic of the book is gone as he manipulates you into feeling in a certain way and cry your eyes out at the end. It worked with A thousand Splendid Suns. No so much here. Maybe the timing was wrong.Even if I hated the MC I still enjoyed Khaled Hosseini writing style."

        "user_review": "After pondering long and hard, I'm going to try now to articulate just what it was about this book that sucked so much, why it has offended me so greatly, and why its popularity has enraged me even more. This book blew so much that I've been inspired to start my own website of book reviews for non-morons. So let us explore why.First, let's deal with the writer himself. Hosseini's father worked for Western companies while in Afghasnistan. While daddy (who I am guessing, from Hosseini's tragic account of the \"fictional\" father, never accepts his son) worked and got wealthy, normal Afghans lived their lives. When war broke out, Hosseini's father was offered a safe position in Iran. Just before the revolution in Iran, his father was offered another job in Paris, before finally taking the family to the USA.That's fine ... some of us are lucky in life. Others are not. What bothers me, though, is that The Kite Runner is so obviously what Hosseini WISHES had happened.There is no doubt in my mind that the Hassan character really did exist in some form or another. Surely Hosseini had a friend/sometimes playmate/servant who was left behind while Hosseini's powerful family escaped. Surely, Hosseini feels guilty for leaving his homeland by simple privilege while the less fortunate were left behind to fight the Soviets, the Mujahideen, and then the Taliban. And surely, Hosseini wishes he were some flawed hero that didn't simply get lucky. Hewisheshe'd majored in English, as the protagonist does, and published fiction books instead of becoming a run-of-the-mill doctor; hewisheshis father had depended upon him in the USA as happens in the book, instead of getting by just fine as a rich exile with a daddy-doesn't-love-me complex; hewisheshe could go back to Afghanistan, risking his life to make ammends for his shitty and cowardly past, instead of remaining a wealthy outsider living happily in the USA.Hosseini is simply some guy who feels guilty about having escaped what so many of his fellow countrymen couldn't, and he makes up for it in fantasy in a million ways: accepting his fallen father, marrying an \"unsuitable\" woman, listening to a voice from the past, saving the son of his friend he watched being raped decades before (when he was too selfish to intervene), stomaching the live stoning of a burka-clad woman and her adulterous lover, taking a beating from an old enemy/Taliban child molestor, giving $2000 to a poor smuggler who tries to feed his kids on $3 a week, and saving a 12 year-old from suicide. If Hosseini REALLY did all this, what a hero he would be. Instead, he just makes it up and calles it a novel ... and people devour this shit with tears, labeling it as \"inspirational\" and \"moving.\"What really bothers me? Besides all of the contrived and predictable plot twists?? What really disturbs me is that people not only eat this shit up, but they also call it \"literature,\" award it, and give this guy money and license to write another book.For lack of better words ... WTF?!!!??! Has everyone just gone STUPID?!!?!?I could go on about how the writing sucks, especially when the author admits to using cliches (elephant in the room, dark as night, thin as a rake, et fucking c) but I won't.Why? A couple of reasons:1) If you liked this book, a part of you is sick, and a larger part of you is an idiot2) I could write a 100-page thesis about how much this book blew monkey chunks, but it's not worth my time3) This shit sells, and Hosseini, between his stupid book and movie deals, is an even richer man than he was before ... which in the end, makes him smarter than you, me, and everyone else .... He understands the market and fed it back to us. We probably deserve it."

        "user_review": "\"There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood.\"I've read books before with an unreliable narrator and also read accounts of cowardice and shame. Amir, the first-person protagonist and narrator from Hosseini's 2003 novel, filled me with such disgust and loathing that I almost put the book down at 25%.My doctor would say that Amir suffered from AWDD – Ass whooping deficiency disorder and I would enthusiastically second that diagnosis.That said, I invite everyone to read the book and see how it all plays out.\"There is a way to be good again...\"The poet Galway Kinnell once wrote that there are some regrets we can never be rid of. He was right in so many ways. An inability to forgive ourselves for past moments of cowardice, shame and inaction are the most troubling and relentless sorrows we can face as humans wandering around on this poor earth. We can forgive others, even those who have harmed us greatly, but looking ourselves in the eye and offering absolution can be an act beyond so many of us.I took my time getting to this book for a great many reasons and now that I have finally read it, I am so glad. This book moved me. Hosseini was able to pluck heart strings of emotion that I had thought silent and stolid. The themes of loyalty, friendship, devotion countered with betrayal, animosity and selfishness were plaintive notes played out in a literary orchestra of human sentiment.\"I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.\"We follow a distorted tale of mistakes and timidity towards an ultimate chance at redemption. Amir's is an understood but still contemptuous plight of lost opportunity. Shielded by cultural, social and religious privilege, his regrettable acts of pusillanimity are displayed against the heroic and admirable examples of his steadfast friend Hassan and his intrepid father. Hosseini paints us a picture of an evolving and destabilizing Afghanistan, tortured for years with Soviet occupation and then granted only the briefest of reprieves before falling to the theocratic and brutal rule of the Taliban. Amir's journey is one of deliverance and redemption.Hosseini's skill and adept description of a modern day caste system where an invisible division existed between the favored Pashtun and the disadvantaged Hazara may be a tale of Afghanistan, but this abstract and superficial distinction can also be a universal cautionary story about racism, intolerance and bigotry.Beautifully written and told with compassion, empathy and with a skilled writer's eye for detail and expression, this can also be a painful book to read. Not for everyone, but for those who can endure what is at times heartbreaking the reward is as magnificent as is this work.\"For you, a thousand times over\""

        "user_review": "After readingAdventures of Huckleberry Finn, I realized that I had absolutely nothing to say about it. And yet here, as you see, I have elected to say it anyway, and at great length.Reading this novel now, at the age of mumble-mumble, is a bit like arriving at the circus after the tents have been packed, the bearded lady has been depilated, and the funnel cake trailers have been hitched to pick-up trucks and captained, like a formidable vending armada, toward the auburn sunset. All the fun has already been used up, and I'm left behind circumnavigating the islands of elephant dung and getting drunk on Robitussin®. Same story, different day.How exactly did I make it through eight total years of high school and undergraduate studies in English without having read any Mark Twain but a brief (and forgotten) excerpt fromLife on the Mississippi? Isn't this illegal by now? I mean, isn't there a clause in the Patriot Act... an eleventh commandment... a dictate from Xenu? Isn'tHuckleberry Finn, likeRomeo and JulietandTo Kill a Mockingbird, now an unavoidable teenage road bump between rainbow parties and huffing spray paint? Isn't it the role of tedious classic literature to add color and texture to the pettiness of an adolescence circumscribed by status updates, muff shaving, and shooting each other? Or am I old-fashioned?Let's face it. In the greater social consciousness, there are two stars of this book: (1) the word 'nigger' and (2) the Sherwood Schwartz-style ending in which Tom Sawyer reappears and makes even the most casual reader wonder whether he might not be retarded.Huckleberry Finn, for all his white trash pedigree, is actually a pretty smart kid -- the kind of dirty-faced boy you see, in his younger years, in a shopping cart at Wal-Mart, being barked at by a monstrously obese mother in wedgied sweatpants and a stalagmite of a father who sweats tobacco juice and thinks the word 'coloreds' is too P.C. Orbiting the cart, filled with generic cigarette cartons, tabloids, and canned meats, are a half-dozen kids, glazed with spittle and howling like Helen Keller over the water pump, but your eyes return to the small, sad boy sitting in the cart. His gaze, imploring, suggestive of a caged intellect, breaks your heart, so you turn and comparison-shop for chewing gum or breath mints. He is condemned to a very dim horizon, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it, so you might as well buy some Altoids and forget about it...That boy is the spiritual descendant of Huckleberry Finn.The 'nigger' controversy -- is there still one? -- is terribly inconsequential. It almost seems too obvious to point out that this is (a) firstly a 'period novel,' meaning it that occurs at a very specific historical moment at a specific location and (b) secondly a first-person narrative, which is therefore saddled with the language, perspective, and nascent ideologies of its narrator. Should we expect a mostly uneducated, abused adolescent son of a racist alcoholic who is living in the South before the Civil War to have a respectful, intellectually-enlightened perspective toward black people? Should the character of Huck Finn, in other words, be ahistorical, anachronistic? Certainly not, if we expect any semblance of honesty from our national literature.Far more troubling to many critics is the ending ofHuckleberry Finn, when -- by a freakishly literary coincidence -- Huck Finn is mistaken for Tom Sawyer by Tom's relatives, who happen to be holding Jim (the slave on the run) in hopes of collecting a reward from his owners. There are all sorts of contrivances in this scenario -- the likes of which haven't been seen since the golden age ofThree's Company-- which ends with Tom arriving and devising a ridiculously elaborate scheme for rescuing Jim.All in all, the ending didn't bother me as much as it bothered some essayists I've read. That is, it didn't strike me as especially conspicuous in a novel which relies a great deal on narrative implausibility and coincidence. Sure, Tom Sawyer is something of an idiot, as we discover, but in a novel that includes faked deaths and absurd con jobs, his idiocy seems well-placed.In the end, I suppose the greatest thing I can say about this novel is that it left me wondering what happened to Huck Finn. Would his intellect and compassion escape from his circumstances or would he become yet another bigoted, abusive father squiring another brood of dirty, doomed children around a fluorescently-lit Wal-Mart?"

        "user_review": "This is a rant. I found Huckleberry Finn on my bookshelf had been changed to Huckleberry Finn Robotic Edition. Some very pc \"authors\" and \"editors\" took it upon themselves to change the N word to 'robot'. They then rewrote the book to take away any mention of humans and to 'roboticise' words such as 'eye' which becomes something like 'optical device'. The illustrations have also been changed. I have no problem with this, but I do have two major issues with this edition.The first problem is with the librarians who think think this is close enough to the original that it should be combined and therefore share the ratings of Mark Twain's original book. There was a long discussion in the librarian thread where some librarians thought it was essentially the same book, perhaps most. So it was combined and the edition of the book I read was changed to that one. I DID NOT read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Robotic Edition.This robot edition was a Kindle book. Think about it and the danger of these 'authors'. If this is acceptable and it is to a lot of the librarians, why not politically correct Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Agatha Christie (oh she's been done already. It was 10 Little N words, then 10 Little Indians, now it's Then there were 10, lol). Sooner or later print books will be in used bookshops, research libraries and old people's houses. They will become not books to be read but collector's items. For reading it will be the ebook where changes can be easily and instantaneously made.And if politically-correcting everything becomes Amazon policy then the whole publishing world will follow and your children will never know the original story that Mark Twain wrote. They will never understand how N word people were treated and that is my second issue with this pc book.They will never know that Jim, a grown man would not normally be expected to hang out with 13 year old boys, kowtowed to Tom and Huckleberry not just because they all liked each other, but because he was not free, he was a slave, property, and was subject to the usual treatment of property. He could be ordered to do anything no matter how stupid or harmful, he could be sold or mistreated not even for punishment but just because he had no human rights whatsoever.Changing N people to robots negates all this. Yes it is more politically acceptable to Whites but how would a Black person feel having their history taken away from them? This is not pc as much as sanitising history and is wrong on every level. And it was done by the authors to make it easier for White teachers to teach this important book (is it important if it is about robots though?) without engendering awkward discussions about race, slavery, why some people have rights and others are property which has also meant the book is on many 'banned' school lists.Do you find this acceptable? A lot of GR librarians don't see a damn thing wrong with it. But I do.SeeFahrenheit 451edited 27 Jan 2018"

        "user_review": "The ugly face of slavery and racismDescribed in detail by one of the big storytellersTwain just had the intuition and talent to create a milestone of enlightening literature, showing humankind its worst flaws by not moralizing, proselytizing, and thereby boring the audience. Instead, all the atrocities are shown in the actions, mentalities, and especially dialogues of theBigoted and primitive people of that timeThat deem themselves superior, smart, and just sheer Übermensch. Many works against slavery, fascism, extremism, and faith use that storytelling trick of making the hatemongering trolls, the stupid, uneducated antagonistic people of that time, ridiculous in contrast to the progressive, sophisticated protagonists. In the case of Huckleberry FinnEveryone except the protagonist is evilBecause the norms, rules, and laws of the time allow them to be. That´s the subject Twain isn´t directly pointing his finger at, but the underlying core of the tale, that opportunity makes thieves. And a society based on exploitation and brutality creates inhuman, full citizen status subjects with all democratic human rights that treat anyone inferior like an animal and worse than their dogs. That´sA scheme as old as historyAnd Twain digs deeper into it in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Courthttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...He goes above the average evil citizen and describes the ones, kings, god emperors, and faith fueled fanatics, who want this mess to better rule the mad masses. One of the, subjective, main reasons why Huckleberry is so much more successful than the Yankee is that it´s easier to read about bad people doing unfriendly things without directly attacking the system itself. The Yankee does this in a satiric way and is even today just too uncomfortable for people who believe that everything is fine. ThisHumor and irony are the final ingredientsOther great works against slavery are mind opening and well written too, but come with a depressing and hopeless undertone. Twain doesn´t just deliver the important messages, but he does it in combination with creating hilarious dialogues, motivations, and character evolutions that combine deep thoughts and giggles. When first reading Twain as a teenager I didn´t get that, I didn´t see the ingenuity of the whole plot that permanently delivers deep and cynical, postmodern social satire with tons of dark comedy elements.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "Mark Twain tells us the story of Huckleberry Finn and Jim, who attempts to free themselves from society's restraints in this book. The racism aspect of this novel is one of the most discussed and debated topics.The readers will have to encounter the N-word multiple times, which can be difficult for many people. The beauty of this book is that it can be viewed from various angles. The theme of how black and white people work together for their quest for freedom has inspired many people. There are many more layers to this book, including the empathy facet, which is not discussed in depth compared to the racism aspect. It is sad to see some people just considering it as a young adult book discussing racism which just high school children should read. This is unequivocally a true classic that all should read due to the author's exceptional writing skills and multiple embedded themes in it.\"Right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better.\""

        "user_review": "HUCK IL SELVAGGIOIl film più recente è del 1993 diretto da Stephen \"La Mummia\" Sommers. Huck è un giovanissimo Elijah Wood, otto anni prima della Trilogia dell'Anello, e suo padre nella foto è Ron Perlman.Romanzo d'avventure, romanzo di formazione, Huckleberry Finn è forse il Grande Romanzo Americano, come e più di Moby Dick.È così almeno per Hemingway che del libro di Twain scrisse:Tutta la letteratura moderna americana deriva da un libro di Mark Twain intitolato Huckleberry Finn. La scrittura americana arriva da lì. Non c'era mai stato niente del genere prima. E non c'è più stato più niente del genere dopo.Viene infatti da dire che è così almeno nella lingua: ben più 'sporca', ben più quotidiana, 'moderna' e impregnata della terra di quella di Melville.Huck e lo schiavo in fuga Jim.L'avventura c'è eccome, la formazione non saprei, forse no: perché Huck fugge per essere libero, per vivere come vuole, e alla fine è costretto a tornare indietro e rientrare in quella civiltà che rifiuta, dalla quale voleva allontanarsi e separarsi. Alla fine è sconfitto, ma non domo.Me ne stavo all'aria tutto il giorno, felice e contento, fumavo e pescavo e non studiavo mai. Così sono passati un paio di mesi e i miei vestiti sono tornati gli stracci sozzi di sempre, e io non riuscivo più a capire come mai m'era piaciuto dalla vedova, dove bisognava lavarsi, mangiare nel piatto, pettinarsi, andare a letto e alzarsi regolare e starsene sempre con un libro in mano con Miss Watson che rompeva tutto il tempo. Non volevo più tornarci. Avevo smesso di dire parolacce perché alla vedova non gli piaceva, ma adesso avevo ricominciato perché papà non aveva niente in contrario. Lassù nei boschi, tutto sommato, me la spassavo proprio.La versione di Michael \"Casablanca\" Curtiz del 1960. Sulla zattera insiem a Huck e Jim il Duca e il Re.Nella sua fuga il ragazzino naviga per il grande fiume Mississippi ed è istintivo pensare al fiume Congo, a Conrad e il suo Marlow, a quel cuore di tenebra che sembra riverberare in questo lungo e maestoso fiume americano dove anche Huck incontra gente ben selvaggia, più selvaggia di lui stesso.Fa poca differenza se il viaggio di uno è a risalire il corso d'acqua verso la sorgente e il suo cuore nero, quello dell'altro è invece a scendere verso la foce.E quando sull'isola deserta del fiume incontra lo schiavo nero Jim, che è fuggito alle catene, e lo porta con sé sulla zattera, come non pensare a Robinson Crusoe e Venerdì?In un mondo di adulti da evitare, sorta di feccia umana, violenti truffaldini lestofanti oppure bigotti e oppressivi, l'unico adulto che si salva è proprio lo schiavo nero Jim.Nella violenza del padre ubriacone che tiene chiuso e sequestrato il figlio come non ritrovare le figure di padri e tutori e maschi adulti che mettevano i brividi nei romanzi di Dickens?Nel film di Michael Curtiz del 1960 Buster Keaton nella parte di Lion Tamer.Romanzo d'avventura e (forse) di formazione, dicevo: ma anche romanzo picaresco per ragazzi e per adulti, pagine che parlano a grandi e piccini. Romanzo sulla fuga. Sulla libertà.Tom Sawyer, l'amico di sempre e delle altre avventure negli altri romanzi, uno prima e uno dopo questo, è un monello che alla fine accetta la civiltà e impara le regole: non così Huck, che rimane selvaggio – il suo viaggio nella civiltà è in realtà un viaggio attraverso la moderna inciviltà.Nell'edizione originale del 1884 ecco l'incontro tra Huck e Jim.Ci sono ovviamente altri livelli di lettura, meno diretti ai ragazzi e più agli adulti, come si addice a un grande romanzo: Huck mette in scena la sua morte, rinuncia alla sua identità per essere libero, dalla morte nasce la sua vita. E quindi una partenza ben nera.Come nero è Jim, nero il fiume percorso soprattutto di notte sotto le stelle, nero il mondo degli adulti (bianchi), nera la civiltà da cui è meglio tenersi alla larga, fuggire, nera la modernità, a cominciare proprio dagli Stati Uniti. Nera è la morale e nere sono le regole di questi adulti, del loro mondo 'civile' e 'moderno'…Huckleberry Finn in un disegno di E.W. Kemble dell'edizione originale 1884 del libro.È bello vivere su una zattera. Il cielo, lassù, era tutto tempestato di stelle, e noi ci sdraiavamo sulla schiena a guardarle e discutevamo se le aveva fatte qualcuno o se erano capitate lì per caso: Jim pensava che le aveva fatte qualcuno, io invece che erano capitate lì per caso – ci voleva troppo tempo per fare tutte quelle stelle. Jim ha detto che forse le aveva covate la luna, e a me mi sembrava sensato, così non ho detto niente anche perché avevo visto una rana covare altrettanti ranocchi e perciò era possibile. Guardavamo anche le stelle cadenti e le scie che si lasciavano dietro. Jim diceva che erano guaste e così le buttavano fuori dal nido.Huck e Jim sulla zattera, illustrazione dell'edizione del 1884."

        "user_review": "We catched fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed, only a kind of low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ~~ Mark TwainSelected by Kenny McCool for August 2021 Big Book Read (In August I am reading the entireTom & Huck Seriesas well asLife on the Mississippi&Huck Out West)Buddy Read with AesaanRandom thought:The more I readThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnthe more I believe this is my very favorite book. I grow to love it more with each repeated reading.In 1876, Mark Twain began writingThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the sequel to his widely popular novelThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer. After eight years of reworking ~~ and sometimes destroying ~~ the manuscript, the novel was published. Fans of its predecessor were surprised to find thatHuck Finnwas not the romantic depiction of southern boyhood thatTom Sawyerwas. Instead, the novel was a realistic look at the hypocrisy and senselessness of southern society.Huck Finntells the story of a young boy searching for freedom and identity in this backwards society.It's hard for many Americans to accept a simple truth ~~ American history is not always pretty. There are atrocities we don't like to be reminded of. For over 135 years,Mark Twain'sThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnhas held up that mirror and challenged us to examine our souls. WhenHuck Finnwas first introduced inThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, he was Tom's untamed friend, the one who was always ready to play hooky and look for pirate treasure; the friend Tom could always trust to follow him without question. In his own story, Huck takes over as narrator with his distinctive voice, sharing with the reader not only his escapades since fleeing his abusive father, but also his growing philosophy about slavery and the changing country around him.In many waysHuckleberry Finnis the story ofJim, the runaway slave who accompanies Huck on his adventures, as much as it is Huck's story. A complicated character, Jim goes from silly to tragic, sometimes even within the same paragraph. He dreams of freedom, not just for himself but for his wife and children, sharing with Huck his desire to purchase each of them back ~~ and if he can't buy them back, he'll steal them. To help emphasize the heartbreak of Jim's plight, Huck witnesses a family split up by a slave auction. Those around Huck are upset by it too, and their inaction speaks volumes.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnhas been one of the most banned books in America. From complaints about its use of foul language and stereotypes, to being a bad influence on children, this book has never escaped controversy. While re-reading it again this go around, I wondered who exactly didTwainpicture as his audience. Sometimes it feels like a young boy's adventure, others it reads as a dour tale for adults. Yes, Huck dresses up like a girl and gets in comic misadventures, but this is more a novel about slavery, beatings, child abuse, alcoholism and murder. Huck's America, much like 45's America, is not a friendly one.Viewing the novel as merely a contemporary tale ofTwain'stime, it is masterful how he handles Jim for that reader. Twain begins by hitting all of the stereotypes Americans of that period would have expected, then he builds on the character until he emerges as a hero, sacrificing his freedom to carry an injured white boy to safety. It is a subtle and brilliant statement against racism and for equality.Lastly,Huckleberry Finnis a book about transitions. These transitions can be seen in the intermediate setting between transitions in which the novel takes place, Huck's disenchantment with society over the course of the novel, and Huck's moral maturation.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnis filled with all sorts of transitions for Huck. Throughout the entire novel, Huck is in a state of Limbo. He's fourteen years old, an awkward stage after childhood and before adulthood ~~ in the throes of puberty, while he's floating down the Mississippi River, the boundary between individual freedom and an immature civilization. Huck transitions from a boy being civilized in St. Petersburg, Missouri, to a young man completely disenchanted with society. Finally, he transitions from being indoctrinated by southern morality to accepting his own individual morals and heading off to free Jim. Huck is constantly changing over the course of the novel. He starts out as the immature Missouri boy playing jokes on slaves, but by the end he is an enlightened young man ready to head west to a better tomorrow. Huckleberry Finn is the future of America.Update 2022: I just completed my annual reading. I love the character of Huck so much.Update 2023: It's amazing all the little things I picked up with this read. Twain is so good."

        "user_review": "\"Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.\"Like many, I've read this book when I was a kid (twice actually, as a kid and a teen), and this was the first time I revisited it as a (hopefully) fully functional adult. And this time my reactions to it were quite magnified. The parts I liked before I loved now, and the parts that irked me in childhood now irritated the living daylights out of me.Huckleberry Finnis a classic, and about half of it deserves that designation. Those are the parts where Twain shines — the parts with the mesmerizing and majestic Mississippi river, the ability to write injustice and abuse without proselytizing and falling into \"misery porn\" trap, and the sharp observation of the folks of the rural American South.\"We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed – only a little kind of a low chuckle.\"And then there are the parts when severe tonal dissonance kicks in and the whiplash of being in another book sets in. It first starts with a bit of annoyance in those endless \"king\" and \"duke\" chapters, but peaks at impressive rate once Tom Sawyer and his hijinks pop up. Tom Sawyer, who belongs in a kids book at best, whose overactive imagination in this situation is no longer cute but dangerous and cruel and incredibly thoughtless — and almost physically painful. (Yes, I know Tom Sawyer is supposed to come across as ridiculous here, but it went on for way too long).Oh, and how bleak and pointlessly violent was the world of rural American South of the 1830? Sometimes I wonder if humanity really deserves to continue on. Yes, there are quite a few funny parts (Huck's rant about Henry VIII many \"achievements\" - from Domesday book to malmsey wine drowning to Boston Tea Party comes to mind*), but my overall take this time is of resolutely grim life. Slavery, violence, alcoholism, cruelty, ignorance, disregard for rights of others - I need to stare at the wall for a little while now.* My favorite rant here, under spoiler tag for brevity sake:\"My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off. 'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'—and they chop it off. 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.\"Being a novel of its time it doesn't go where I wish it did, but even classics belong to their time, and this one is not an exception. And people needed to start like Huck — deciding that\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\"— because you have to start somewhere.3.5 stars, and my brain is busily editing Tom Sawyer out of this story).————Buddy read with Nastya.——————Also posted onmy blog."

        "user_review": "I first read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn when I was in high school. I don't remember if it was the full book or an abridged version in a textbook.I only remembered three things about the book.1. The Explanatory statement at the beginning of the book where Twain talks about dialects and such.2. Huckleberry and Jim floating down the Mississippi River on a raft. (I definitely didn't remember how their adventure started or ended.)3. I also remembered that Huck and others frequently used the N-word. (I didn't remember that they used the N-word 219 times!)I reread Huck Finn by listening to the first thirty-two chapters of an audio book narrated by Elijah Wood. Then I read chapters thirty-three through forty-three using a text-based digital copy of the book I obtained from my local library. I started with an audio book because I wanted to get a feel for the various dialects.I almost quit the book early on because I found the use of the N-word so offensive. I decided to continue reading the book after I read the PEN America essay titled Here's Why Banning 'Huck Finn' Over The N-Word Sends The Wrong Message.Huck Finn deals with serious topics such as slavery, child abuse, the flim-flamery we now call \"white\" crime, and the importance of personal loyalty and integrity. The book starts and ends like a humorous YA adventure but like a four star restaurant there's some serious meat and potatoes between the appetizer and dessert.I do have to admit I found the comedic shtick between Tom Sawyer, Huck, and Jim to be tedious. I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages, and finally chapters. Tom Sawyer seems to represent America's long standing bias against \"intellectural\" people. Tom reminded me of all the clever know-it-alls who do their own research during a pandemic. Tom and Huck express America's bias against deductive reasoning and its favorable view of \"common sense\"."

A question I have had to ask myself repeatedly over the last few days, after students in Grade 8 received the task to come to the library and \"check out a classic to read\". There was a list with the usual suggestions, but students ventured out and started to explore shelves, and then came to me with a wide range of books, repeating the question:\"Is this a classic?\"Why did I turn down the diary of a wimpy kid, they wanted to know, and accept Huckleberry Finn, even though it was so much harder to understand, and also, they had heard it was racist?All good questions, and I was careful not to give a too categorical answer. The last thing I wanted was for them to make the connotation that a classic is a boring must, while a \"good book\" is what the teachers and librarians would refuse.Difficult.I found myself talking about the Count of Monte Cristo and Voldemort, about Tom Sawyer and Oliver Twist in comparison to Harry Potter, and I made a case for trying to get through parts of Huckleberry Finn even though the language is challenging, mainly because it contains exactly the message that people become unfair \"when they don't know nothing about it\".I found myself talking about discovering other times, other societies, other ideas of justice and hierarchy, and I talked about living in the mind of someone other than oneself. Imagine Huckleberry on that raft on the Mississippi, I said. Imagine him being in a conflict between the values he was taught and the humanity he discovered together with his fellow human, who happened to be a black man in distress. Which concept of life would be stronger?Imagine a situation in which you would have to make a choice between what you are taught and what you perceive?\"That's interesting\", a student said.Another one replied:\"Yeah, but it really is racist too!\"And I thought:\"That makes a classic. A book that can still inspire discussions in a school library some 135 years after its initial publication.\"So, dear Harry, I hope that in the year 2133, some librarian will tell students that you are a classic hero, still worthy of their attention, even though your worldview may seem a bit dated and out of touch with their perception of reality! And just imagine all the Voldemorts we will have had to fight to make sure there are still school libraries and reading kids by then!To Huck and Harry!"

But the return of Huck Finn's drunk of a father, Pap, hints at the darker, more serious themes of this novel. After being kidnapped and beaten, Huck escapes his father by faking his own death and then going on the run. He soon crosses paths with a runaway slave, Jim, and together they raft their way down the Mississippi.Like its predecessor,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnis largely a series of vignettes with a very loose overarching plot. Huck and Jim travel from Missouri through Kentucky and Arkansas and into the antebellum South, getting into scrapes and making escapes along the way. There's some great humor in their conversations on the raft; their argument about the wisdom of King Solomon is priceless. And there's classic Twain satire and exposing of hypocrisy here, from the feuding Grangerford and Shepardson families to the con men known as the Duke and the King.So why was I reading this classic novel during Banned Books Week? For that, we have to talk about race and racism. The characters here (and the author, for that matter) are products of their 19th century time. The n-word is used relentlessly in this book, even by the slaves themselves, and it is jarring. Huck says casually racist things here that are heartbreakingly awful; on one occasion, for example, he compliments Jim by thinking \"I knowed he was white inside.\" And some critics fairly read this book as irredeemably problematic, reinforcing racist stereotypes and repeatedly deriving humor from a variation of a minstrel show.But I come down on the side of those who readThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnas transcending and challenging the racist stereotypes of the time. Huck has been taught by society all his life to view blacks as slaves, as less than. And at a pivotal moment, he writes a letter to report where Jim can be found by his master, and at first he thinks the letter is the right thing to do:I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\"All right, then, I'llgoto hell\"—and tore it up.Huck says the wrong thing, and uses racist language, again and again throughout this book. But he ultimately recognizes and acts on his and Jim's shared humanity and equality. That might be the best we can realistically expect from a book published in the 1880s. And some days, it's obvious that our society has not come nearly as far on this score as we'd like to think we have.IsThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinntheGreat American Novel? It's written by an immortal, epically talented writer. It was one of the first books to truly capture the course, plain spoken language of its time. And by focusing on racism and slavery, it speaks to America's original sin. So yeah, it just might be, even though I preferTo Kill a Mockingbird. Highly recommended."

        "user_review": "I had mixed feelings about this book.On the one hand, it's clear that Mark Twain was progressive for his day, satirizing the topsy-turvy morals of the slavery-era south. His heroes are two people at the bottom rung of the social ladder - a runaway slave, and the son of the town drunk. Though they're not valued by society, they turn out to be the two most honorable characters of the book. And I appreciated the questions it raised, about how we construct our own sense of morality in the context of broader social morals, and how we deal with potential conflicts between those two. I loved Huck for choosing to go to hell rather than turn in his friend.On the other hand, it's such a far-fetched farce, with so many over-the-top scenes, one crazy situation after another, so many coincidences, such silliness, that I had a hard time enjoying it. At the end, Tom keeps adding all kinds of superfluous details into the escape plan, just to satisfy his sense of drama. The author seems to think this will be amusing - see how it's a funny game to Tom, see how he's influenced by all the adventure books he's ever read... And I just wanted to smack the kid, and say, \"A man's life is in danger! How dare you treat this like a game of make-believe! Just get him out of there, you idiot!\"The humor reminded me a lot of Candide. That style (social satire, ironic farce, fable, whatever you want to call it) can be a great way to make a point. But it's not the same as a novel with well-developed characters and a realistic plot.Sometimes I enjoy satire, but yesterday, I just wasn't in the mood. I felt like the atrocities committed in our country against African-Americans were just too horrific to laugh at.I have heard that people often protest this book when it appears on school curricula, because of the repeated use of the n-word. I think I had an easier time accepting that word, because it reflected the common usage of the time, and it felt like part of the natural, authentic voice of the narrator. I had a harder time with the portrayal of Jim as a naive, superstitious, gullible, person, who seems completely dependent on a young white boy to figure out what to do. Jim is good, but he doesn't come across as particularly smart. He's more an archetype - the noble savage - than a real person.I think the main value of this book is as a historical artifact. You can see the important role it played if you look at what it was for the time it was written in, and how it influenced other books written in America. But I don't think it could get published today. I'm glad to say, we've come a long way."

        "user_review": "Why have I never readAdventures Of Huckleberry Finnbefore? Was it Twain's copious use of the N word? (I vaguely recall a primary school teacher abruptly halting a class read-aloud session, perhaps because of that.) Was it the air of earnest solemnity that surrounds so-called classics? Sheer laziness?No matter. I've read it now, and I'll never be the same again. Hemingway was right when he said (and I'm paraphrasing) all American literature comes from Huck Finn. While it'd be entertaining to read as a kid, it's even more rewarding to approach as an adult.Savour that wonderful opening paragraph (and tell me you can't hear Holden Caulfield in the cadences):You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly – Tom's Aunt Polly, she is – and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.Everything to come is in those opening lines, penned in that distinct, nearly illiterate yet crudely poetic voice. You get a sense of Huck's humility (compared to Tom Sawyer's braggadocio); his intelligence; a cute postmodern nod to the author; the idea that storytelling contains \"stretchers\" but can also tell \"the truth\"; and the fact that everyone lies, including Huck.EspeciallyHuck. He gets into so many tight spots that part of the joy is wondering how he'll get out of them.The outlines of the plot should be familiar: Huck, a scrappy, barely literate boy, flees his abusive, alcoholic father by faking his death and travelling the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers with Jim, an escaped slave, on a raft.Huck's gradual awakening to Jim's plight is subtle and touching, never sentimental. In a sense the book chronicles his growing conscience. And the colourful characters he and Jim meet and the adventures they have add up to a fascinating, at times disturbing look at a conflicted, pre-Civil War nation.We meet a Hatfields vs. McCoys type situation; a group of rapscallions who put on a vaudeville-style act and try to fleece rubes; a scene of desperation and danger on a collapsed boat. We witness greed, anger and most of the other deadly sins – all from a little raft on the Mississipi. And before the midway point, we see the toll that a cruel joke can have on someone's feelings.To a contemporary reader, some of the humour can feel a little forced, and the gags do get repetitive, particularly when Huck's savvier, better-read friend Tom enters the scene.And then comes a passage like this:When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sun-shiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits whispering – spirits that's been dead ever so many years – and you always think they're talking about YOU.Wow. You can see, hear andfeelwhat he's describing. Hard to believe this was written more than 150 years ago.In the book's closing pages, Huck tells us this:If I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.Well, gosh, Huck, it war worth all yer trouble. We're darn glad you dunnit. Yessir."

        "user_review": "I had to readThe Adventures of Tom Sawyerin middle school, and I fervently wish that they had made us readHuck Finninstead. I mean, I understand why they didn't (giving middle schoolers an excuse to throw around racial slurs in a classroom setting is just asking for a lawsuit from somebody's parents), butHuck Finnis better. It's smarter, it's funnier, and Huck's adventures stay with you a lot longer than Tom's, because Huck's experiences were richer and more interesting, whereasThe Adventures of Tom Sawyercould easily have been titledThe Adventures of an Entitled Little Asshole.If Tom had to go through half of what happens to Huck in this story, he'd be balled up in the corner crying after five minutes. The action ofHuck Finnis set in motion when Huck's father shows up and decides that he's going to be responsible for his son now (the story picks up right whereTom Sawyerleft off, with Huck and Tom becoming rich, hence Finn Sr.'s sudden involvement in his kid's life). Huck's father essentially kidnaps him, taking him to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and getting drunk and beating his son. Huck escapes by faking his own death (and it'sawesome) and begins traveling up the Mississippi river. He runs into Jim, a slave who belonged to the Widow Douglas's sister. Jim overheard his owner talking about selling him, so he decided to run away and try to go north. Huck, after some hesitation, goes with him. From this point, the structure of the book closely mirrorsDon Quixote: a mismatched pair of companions travels the country, having unrelated adventures and comic intervals. On their travels, Huck and Jim encounter con men, criminals, slave traders, and (in the best mini-story in the book) a family involved in a Hatfields-and-McCoys-like feud with a neighboring clan. The story comes full circle when Tom Sawyer shows up and joins Jim and Huck for the last of their adventures, and the best part of this is that Tom Sawyer's overall ridiculousness becomes obvious once we see him through Huck's eyes.Huck is a great narrator, and I think one of the reasons I liked this book more than its counterpart was because it's narrated in first person, and so Huck's voice is able to come through clearly in every word. In addition to the great stories, there are also some really beautiful descriptions of the Mississippi river, as seen in this passage about the sun rising on the river:\"The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line - that was the woods on t'other side - you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness, spreading around; then the river softened up, away off, and warn't black any more, but grey; you could see little dark spots drifting along, ever so far away - trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks - rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking, or jumbled up voices; it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin on the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of the river, being a wood-yard, likely, and pulled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh, and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\"(also that was one single sentence. Damn, Mark Twain.)A fun, deceptively light series of stories that's funny and sad when you least expect it. Well done, The List - you picked a good one, for once....why are you still here? The review's over.Oh, I get it. You want me to talk about the racism, right? You want me to discuss how Huck views Jim as stolen property instead of a person and criticize the frequent use of the N-Word and say \"problematic\" a lot, right?Well, tough titties. I'm not getting involved in that, because it's stupid and pointless, and I'm just going to let Mark Twain's introduction toThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnspeak for itself, and the work as a whole: \"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\""

        "user_review": "One of my absolute favourite books, which I have read multiple times. A major classic. If at all possible, get an edition with the original illustrations.___________________________________(Expanded review based on conversation withJORDAN)Here in Switzerland,l'affaire du mot Nhasn't quite had the high profile it's received on its home territory. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that I hadn't even heard of it until Jordan gave me a few pointers earlier today. So, no doubt all this has been said before, but I still can't resist the temptation to add my two centimes worth.In case you're as ignorant as I was about hot topics in the literary world, the furore concerns an edition ofHuckleberry Finnin which the word 'nigger' has been systematically replaced with 'slave'. My initial response was plain surprise. One of the aspects of the book I enjoy most is Twain's appallingly exact ear for dialogue. He's reproducing the language actually used in the American South of the 1840s, and this, above all, is what gives the novel its force; so why on earth would anyone want to change it? For example, here's Huck's Paw in full flow:\"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me -- I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold? -- that's what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now -- that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger.I'm sorry, but I'm honestly unable to see how anyone could think the above passage was racist or might be improved by substituting 'slave' for 'nigger'. It's incidents like this which create the popular European myth that Americans don't understand the concept of irony.If you're curious to know more about the tradition of improving great works of literature by removing dubious words, you might want to take a quick look atthe Wikipedia article on Thomas Bowdlerwhich Jordan and I were giggling over. Bowdler, it turns out, had acted from the best of motives. When he was young, his father had entertained him by reading aloud from Shakespeare; butLater, Bowdler realised his father had been extemporaneously omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. Bowdler felt it would be worthwhile to present an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not a sufficiently \"circumspect and judicious reader\" to accomplish this expurgation himself.He undertook to create a suitably amended version. Or, to be exact, he got his sister to do it and then gave out the books under his own name. Again, his reasons were unimpeachable: it would have reflected badly on her to admit that she had understood the naughtier passages.I won't criticise Dr Bowdler or his equally well-meaning modern followers. I just think it's a shame Mark Twain never had the opportunity to write a story about them."

        "user_review": "THE Greatest American Novel?Well...No wonder the Spanish think themselves intellectually/culturally superior with their Quixote, undoubtedly a blueprint for this mischievous Every Boy! Huck Finn is the full embodiment of THE American Fantasy: mainly that dire misconception that the protagonist of the world is you and that everything gravitates around that essential nucleus. Everyone in town thinks Huck dead, and what does he do but follow the tradition of a plot folding unto itself (as Don Q finds his story become medieval pop culture in Part II of that superior novel) as he disguises himself as a little girl and tries to squeeze information out of some lady about his myth-in-the-making trek. It seems everyone cares for this vagrant, a perpetual Sancho P to Tom Sawyer's Quixote, whose redeemable features include (a pre-transcendental) openmindedness and an inclination to live only in the NOW. But the narrator, a very unreliable one at that, surrounds himself with bad bad men, playing the role of accomplice often, always safe and sound under the dragon's wing. Very American in his lemming mentality & in his misconceptions (though about his hometown and wilderness he knows much indeed).So: disguise used as an integral plot device several times throughout; brawny men taking a boy hostage; nakedness by the riverbed; costume changes, improvised Shakespearean shows, men almost always described as \"beautiful\" (and women solely as \"lovely\")....***GAY!!***Yeah, it really is hard to discern the allegory behind all of this hype. The humor is obvious, but I have to admit that this picaresque novel about a boy who avoids \"sivilization\" at all costs is beaten mercilessly by a more modern, therefore more RELEVANT tale of the South, \"Confederacy of Dunces.\" Although it must be admitted that \"Huck Finn\" does manage to surpass other often-praised classics, like the droll \"Wuthering Heights.\""

        "user_review": "Pretty good, kinda silly - but I think that is what Twain was going for - 3.5 stars.Twain is the king of the Yarn. Huckleberry Finn is a collection of outlandish tales all with lies and trickery at their heart. At the time of its release I am sure it became a bible for scoundrels and mischevious teens.This book is controversial, and even frequently banned, because of its portrayal of black slaves and the use of the N-word. I venture into shaky ground here by offering my opinion as I am white, but I don't think I will cause too much trouble. I can accept that at the time of writing the words and language were fairly normal so as a time period piece it is true. However, I can't say I have read a book that takes place in that time period that so flippantly tosses the n-word around. Regarding banning of this book - I can definitely tell why some parents might be concerned about their kids reading this book. I think a lot of it depends on how it is being taught - I would hope the teacher would put an emphasis on explaining the language being used.Summary:- A good book- Kind of silly- A handbook for deception- An understandably controversial reflection of the prejudices at the time it was written- Some may need guidance regarding the the way racial differences are portrayed in this book."

        "user_review": "\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\" --This is Huck's decision, rather than turn in his friend, Jim. They had been through many things together.Here's the story....Huck faked his death and ran away from his drunken father. On Jackson's Island, in the middle of the Mississippi River, Huck encounters Jim, a runaway slave and his friend. Jim fled because he overheard his owner, Miss Watson, planning to sell him to a plantation. Huck and Jim ultimately must escape the island because their campfire is spotted.Later in their adventures Huck reports...I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:'Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.'I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell.And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind.I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:\"All right, then, I'll GO to hell\" -- and tore it up.'Huck's epiphany is that Jim is a human being, no matter what people call him or how they treat him, and Huck is willing to risk his soul to help him.===========I don't listen to many audiobooks, but if you like them may I suggest the brilliantly narrated version by Elijah Wood. He captures the colloquial speech brilliantly in a way I never got from the written page.https://itunes.apple.com/us/audiobook..."

Apart from the names, there is no other similarity between the two.I was baffled by the style of writing. It was different. The tone was different too. I enjoyed reading about Huckleberry Finn more than Tom Sawyer.If you happen to be one who's always in the hunt of character development while picking a book. Sadly, this one might not be the one for you. I for one couldn't find any difference in Huckleberry Finn from start to end, as far as character is concerned. He remains the same throughout the story.This book has racism, misogyny and bad parenting behaviour. So look out for those while you decide to read it.Review Posted: 21 May 2022.VisitMy Blogto read this and all my other reviews."

        "user_review": "I knows I's gywne teh like tis bookA delightfully funny and nostalgic piece of writing. This is my first Mark Twain and it will most certainly not be my last.Secondhand NostalgiaAlthough my grandfather grew up in the 1940s and not 1840s, there is an undeniable similarity in their childhoods. Both by grandfather and Huck are masterful storytellers who convey a tenable sense of freedom - stories that elicit nostalgia in me although I have not experienced them myself. Both convey a time that was simpler, and yet in many ways infinitely more complex than our own.Mark's a funny guyI believe that the relationship between Huck and Jim is very well executed. It is not simple. A major theme of the novel is that Huck's religious and societal beliefs (going to hell for helping an escaped slave) and his moral beliefs (that helping a slave is the right thing to do) clash. The way in which Twain portrays this clash is not only masterful, but shrouded in humour as Twain is wont to do. What I adore about Twain's humour is that it is still relevant and funny more than 100 years later.Old kids on the BlockI also feel that Twain writes children very well. I could immediately relate to Huck's out-of-the-box thinking and Tom's outrageous answers to solving problems. Twain reminds us that although Huck is faced with immense challenges that question his moral fibre and very place in society, he is just a kid. Mark has a penchant for writing child characters as well as Stephen King.Hobbit's got a voiceThe conversations between Jim and Huck had me crying with laughter. This was enhanced by Elijah Woods' narration of the audio book. His intonation, emphasis and accents were all well-timed and well-executed. This hobbit did good.Racism and Huck FinnWhat I find interesting about this book is that it was initially banned for being too liberal and pro-black. Several decades later, it is considered racist and slandering. I will not comment on this - only that it reveals a lot about how a society develops. Always take a classic with a grain of salt. Misogyny and racism are an inevitability in many classics and should be taken as a period piece and not a criticism for social justice. Jim's also the result of the times - he may seem a caricature, but I feel that we won't do Jim justice if we don't look at his situation as well as his deep meanderings on life that are often masked as humour and satire.The only reason I did not give Huck Finn 5 stars is that the book degraded in quality by the last quarter. I felt that it was being drawn out and forced by then.All round, Huck Finn is a solid classic and I'll be happy to return to Huck's world when I read Tom Sawyer."

        "user_review": "I have re-read Huckleberry Finn after more than 30 years and I must say that I did not remember it at all like that. Another of those books that are read by children believing that they are children's books and that then when they re-read as adults they have unexpected feelings. There are all the emotions of the great American novels of the past, that is, the discovery, the journey, going beyond both geographical and psychological borders, the vastness of America, freedom, everything. If you read it as a boy you like it; if you read it as an adult, you like it even more. It is a book on nonconformism, on the choice (possible but not obvious) to go against the current, not to do what others would like us to do. In some Twain biographies it is said that to write Huckleberry Finn he was inspired by his childhood friend, a boy who lived in a shack on the banks of the Mississippi. A boy out of limits, who did not go to school, did not work and spent his time fishing or hunting in the woods, refractory to all the rules to which all the others had to comply. In the book, Huckleberry Finn is a motherless boy with an abusive and alcoholic father. Huckleberry smokes, says bad words, does only what he likes and is not afraid of anything or anyone. When he and Tom Sawyer (the one from Twain's other book, of which this is the continuation) share the bandits' treasure, they become rich, which is why Huckleberry, abandoned by his alcoholic father, is adopted by Mrs. Douglas, a bigoted widow. After a while, Huck decides to escape from the widow's house, who had set herself the goal of civilizing Huck, teaching him education, reading the Bible and sending him to school. To escape, he uses a raft found on the Mississippi embankment and begins his journey with Jim, a black slave, who has fled his mistress who wanted to sell it. The Mississippi is described very well with its storms, its mists, its silences, its beauty, but the journey of the two is also full of pitfalls, such as when, for example, they meet a couple of scammers, who with various expedients manage to sell Jim to Tom's aunt's sister. The story then continues with Huckleberry and Tom trying to free Jim, while in the meantime Huckleberry and Jim are wanted by the police who want to recapture the black fugitive. After many attempts the two companions finally manage to free Jim. At the end of this trip Huckleberry is informed of the death of his father and plans to leave with his companions for a thousand other adventures, starting with the Indian Territories.The book is very pleasantly read and, despite being a classic, it is still very current, proving, if needed, that Twain was a Great. In his journey, Huckleberry will learn to distinguish good from evil and will understand, among great difficulties, values such as solidarity and equality between men. A very readable, fun, but also profound book: during their escape Huck and Jim live the greatest and most beautiful adventures they can imagine, under the banner of the American dream of freedom. Huck and Jim embody this dream, while all the other protagonists of the book represent the \"pigeonholed\" or the negative, that is, the bigots, the greedy, the boring, the hateful. If the little reader recognizes the protagonist of the book in Huck, the adult reader will find that the most important figure is Jim, the black, the slave, the human refusal, or better, what society does not even consider a human being. Instead he is the only real man in the novel. The rebellious boy and the escaping slave: two to whom nobody would give two cents. Yet these two, in the nights spent on the river looking at the stars, ask themselves the same questions that the great philosophers ask themselves: they wonder (and ask us) about freedom, about the stars of heaven, about the existence of God. Does it seem little to you?"

        "user_review": "3rd Review- August 2022I readFrankensteinfor a sixth time this week. Although it is one of my favourite novels, and in my opinion one of the finest pieces of fiction ever written, I find myself with a new appreciation of the text every time I come to it.A large proportion of one of my PhD chapters is about this novel. I'm discussing the idea of the vegetable diet along with purity and becoming our natural selves. And I'm also considering notions of animal rights, of the idea that man is very much an animal too and he has lost this sense of original self.Frankensteinat its very core is a novel about duality, of our capability to be both good and evil and to be both human and animal.There is so much to take from this book and there's so much that be taken apart, scrutinised and then put back together again. What's truly striking about the work is how much is reflects the anxieties of the age. It's full of insecurities about nature, god, science and our place in the world. Ultimately, it is a novel that creates a sense of unease because it highlights so much about the inauthentic nature of the lives many of us live. Running through the novel is a craving for freedom: a craving to to simply exist in a natural way.2nd Review- January 2020Some books teach you something new each time you revisit them.I picked up the tragically wonderfulFrankensteinfor a fifth time this week, and I was totally mesmerised by the descriptive language used to describe the natural world.In all my previous readings, I focused on all the classic tropes of man and monster though I never considered the importance of the serene beauty that surrounds the story. The natural world dominates the background of the novel. It's there, like a pervading monster that lingers in the darkest reaches of the mind.What struck me most about it was the fact that both Victor and his creation long for a real life, a life where one is truly alive. And they both ponder what this means at length, reaching the same conclusion: to go completely nomad. They both wish to live a life free of burden and complications, no money, no commitments and no responsibility. They just want to be totally free in the wilderness with the ultimate goal of finding happiness by looking after their most immediate and natural desires.And for me this says a great deal about society, not just the society in which this was written, but society in general: how many of us feel truly alive?Original Review- 2016Let's have a party Victor. Let's get together and celebrate all things Gothic, and dark, and wonderful. Let's have it in an attic in an old house in the middle of a thunderstorm, and then afterwards let's go to the graveyard with our shovels and our body bags. Sounds good doesn't it Victor? We could then create our own doppelgängers from the corpses of criminals and geniuses. Then we can abandon our marvellous creation to fend for itself with his childlike innocence, and then wonder why it goes so horribly wrong and blows up in our faces.Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. On second thought we probably shouldn't have that party.Because if we did it would end in bloodYes, lots of blood: the blood of everyone you love, the blood of all your family Victor. You blame the monster, but you are his creator. You should have taught him the ways of the world and guided his first steps. The things you two could have accomplished together. So I ask you this Victor, who is the real monster? Is it the creature that has gone on a murderous rampage or it you? You are the man who played at god and was horrified at the consequence. You judged your creation by his physical appearance, which was more a reflection of your vain soul. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. Surely you don't wonder why the monster revenged himself upon you?\"I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...\"Indeed, the real monster of this novel is Victor Frankenstein, and not his monstrous creation. The creature is a monster on the outside but Victor is on the inside, which is a form much worse. By abandoning the creature he has taught him to become what his appearance is. The first human experience he receives is rejection based upon his physicality. His own creator recoils in disgust from him. He cannot be blamed for his actions if all he has been taught is negative emotion, he will only respond in one way. He is innocent and childlike but also a savage brute. These are two things that should never be put together. Woe to Victor Frankenstein's family.\"There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.\"Mary Shelley raises questions of the danger of knowledge, and shows a probable consequence of trying to play god; the novel portrays nineteen century fears for the rising field of science and knowledge and questions how far it could go. Indeed, in this case Victor takes on the role of a God by creating new life. She also shows us what can happen to a man if he so driven by this thirst for knowledge and how it will ultimately lead to a fall. Victor reminds me somewhat of Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) in this regard. Faustus is a man who sold his soul to Lucifer for unlimited knowledge in the form of arcane magic. Victor, like Faustus, has stopped at nothing to gain his goal, but in the end is ultimately dissatisfied with the result.Suffice to say, I simply adore this book as you may have gathered from my ramblings. I think this, alongside Dracula, are amongst the strongest representations of Gothic literature. Furthermore, I have a real soft spot for epistolary means of storytelling. I'm not sure why, perhaps it's the stronger sense of intimacy you fell with the characters as you see their words on the page rather than an impartial narrators. You see inside their heads more and understand their motifs and feelings.My favourite quote:\"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.Listen to the passion, to the intellect and witness such a wasted opportunity. Victor, you're a silly, silly, man.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________"

        "user_review": "Myapologies, but thisreviewis going to be a bitfranticdue to mybrainbeing sooxygen-starvedby the novel'sbreath-stealinggorgeousness that I'm feeling a bit light-headed. So please forgive the random thoughts.First:Mary Shelley…I love you!!Second:Dear Hollywood - you lyingdung pileof literature-savaging, no talent hacks…you got this all wrong. Please learn to read and get yourself a copy of the source material before youFUBARit again.Third:My heart shattered for the \"monster\" and I haven't felt this strong a desire to \"hug it out, bitch\" since readingGrendelandCrooked Letter, Crooked Letter. The \"wretch\" is so well drawn and powerfully portrayed that he form the emotional ligament for the entire story. He is among the finest creations the written form has to offer.Fourth:As surprised as I am to be saying this, this novel has oustedDraculaas my all time favorite of the classic horror stories…sorry Bram, but the good/evil, sad, desperate loneliness of the orphaned monster trying to find a purpose and to define himself in the world trumps The Count.Five:No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.As gorgeous as the prose is, I thought it a crime not to include at least one quote.Six:The \"non-explanation\" for the process that Victor uses to create the monster is thing of genius. No other approach could have possibly conveyed the majesty and significance of the achievement, because we would have known it was bullshit. Shelley did it perfectly…which leads me nicely into…Seven:The corny, slapdash lightning scene is entirely a work of Hollywood? There's …NO…lightning…scene? Are you kidding me? Even Kenneth Branagh's supposedly \"true\" adaptation had electric eels providing power to the \"it's alive\" process. All of it bunk. I'll say it again, Hollywood is a bunch of useless tools. . LIARS!!!Eight:Speaking of tools, Victor Frankenstein is a giant one. As far as I am concerned, he is clearly the villain of the piece. However, what I found so squee-inducingly magical about Shelly's writing was my degree of vacillation when it came to Victor's character. I liked and even admired Victor in the beginning of the story and found his personal journey compelling. He was a genius driven by his desire to unlock the secrets of the universe and had that manic, \"mad scientist\" focus necessary to the accomplishment of such a lofty goal. However, once the \"birth\" of the monster came, I found myself waffling back and forth throughout the rest of the story. Ironically, his moment of success and his reaction to life he had conjured was when he began to lose his humanity in my eyes.His treatment of the monster was abhorrent. Despite this, Shelley was able to get me to see over my disgust and appreciate Frankenstein's position and understand why he was so unwilling to continence the existence of \"the wretch.\" Not enough for me to forgive his lack of compassion, but enough for me to see him as a tragic figure. Huge propers for Shelley as that is excellent writing.Nine:I would place the monster among the finest literary creations of all time. This singular manifestation of humanity's scientific brilliance and callous indifference to the consequences thereof is masterfully done. Frankenstein's \"wretch\" became the prototype of the literary outcast and every \"misunderstood\" creature since has been offspring from his loins. His character profile is phenomenal, and just as Victor's actions garner sporadic moments of understanding for his cruel treatment of the monster, so the monster's wanton acts of vile cruelty severely test our compassion for him. Tested, bent and stretched, but, for me at least, never broken. I understood his pain…I understood his anger…I understood.Ten:No spoilers here, but the final resolution of the relationship between Victor and the child of his genius was…stellar. Everything was reconciled and nothing was resolved. The final reckoning occurs and it is both momentous and useless.Eleven:I expected the prose to be good but, having never read Shelley before, I was still surprised by how exceptional and ear-pleasing it was. Her writing really resonated with me and I loved her ability to weave emotion, plot momentum and a high literary quotient seamlessly together. Good, good stuff.Twelve:The novel is structured as anepistolary nesting dollusing the frame story ofCaptain Waltoncorresponding with his sister about his expedition to the North Pole. While at the top of the world, Walton finds Victor Frankenstein stranded. This sets up the dovetail into Walton relaying Victor's story which takes up the bulk of the novel and includes within it the incredibly poignant story of the \"monster\" in the creature's own words. It is superbly executed and I thought the framing device was very effective.Thirteen:Despite my trashing of the movie versions earlier, there was one scene that I thought was handled far better on screen than in this story. Kenneth Branagh's portrayal ofthe murder of Elizabeth by the monsterwas far more chilling than Shelley's more subdued recounting. I actually anticipated this segment being far more shocking and I was a tad let down as a result. This is probably my only gripe about the book.Fourteen:On my list of all time favorite novels. The writing, the story, the characters, the emotion, the imagery, the power…all off the charts.6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!P.S.(orFifteen:) I listened to the audio version of this read by Simon Vance and his performance was extraordinary, especially his portrayal of the \"monster.\" Definitely check it out if you are a consumer of audio books."

        "user_review": "So.I finished it.Warning:If you are a fan of classic literatureand/orare utterly devoid of a sense of humor this review may not be for you.Also:Yes, I realize that I'm a moron with zero literary credibility. So, stop reading right now if the sound of an idiot whistling out of their asshole bothers you too terribly. Sure, you can comment below and tell me how stupid I am, but it probably won't make me a better person. Or will it...?I've always wondered what therealFrankenstein story was like...and now I know.Sadly, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality.And therealityis, this book is a big steaming pile of poo.It's an old-timey horror story, right?Not so much.I mean, I wasn't expecting it to actually be scary, but I thought it might be slightly creepy. Unfortunately, the onlyhorrorin the story centered around me having to keep turning the pages.Unless...Beware mortal! You will DIE of boredom! Oooga-Booga-Booga!Yep. Truly frightening.It starts like this:An upper-crust guy sails off to the Arctic tomake discoveries, and to pass the time he writes to his sister. Supposedly, he's been sailing around on whaling ships for several years. And he's been proven an invaluable resource by other captains.So I'm assuming he's a pretty crusty ol' sailor at this point.Pay attention, because this is where Shelly proves that she knowsnothingabout men...So this guy goes on and on in these letters to his sister about how he wishes on every star that he could find a BFF at sea. After a few (too many) letters, they pull a half-frozen Frankensicle out of the water.Aaaaand here's what our salty sea dog has to say about the waterlogged mad scientist...\"Blah, blah, blah...his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness...blah, blah, blah...\"Lustrous eyes?! No (straight) sailor ever, in the history of the world, EVER referred to another dude's eyes aslustrous.Ever.And I know what you're thinking.Well, Anne, maybe this character was gay. Didn't think about that, didja?!Actually, yes. Yes, I did.The only problem with that theory is thatNONEof the male characters in this book sounded remotelymale.Ladies, do you remember that time in your life (probably around middle or high school), when you thought that guysactuallyhad the same sort of thought waves running through their heads that we do? You know, before you realized that the reallydon'tcare about...well, all of the things that we do? You thought that while they were laughing at the booger their idiot friend just flicked across the room, somethingdeeperwas stirring in their mind. It just had to be!I'm not sure when it happens, but at some point, every woman finally realizes the (fairly obvious) truth.Men aren't women.That booger was the funniest thing ever, andnothingwas stirring around in them other than maybe some gas.And that's ok.Fart-lighting and long distance loogie hawking contests aside, they can pretty darn cool.But this author was too young to realize that.My personal opinion is that Mary was probably fairly sheltered when it came to real men. She was a teenage girl apparently running around with a bunch of artsy-fartsy dudes. Much like today, I would imagine these junior emos were probably blowing poetic smoke up her young ass in the high hopes of getting into her pants.Although it's possible I'm totally misreading the situation.Anyway, Frank tells his story, and Sea Dog writes it all down for his sister.In excruciating detail.Rivers, flowers, rocks, mountain tops...agonizingly cataloged. And the weather? God forbid a breeze blows through the story withoutat leasta paragraph devoted to the way it felt on his skin or affected his mood!And speaking of Frankenstein'smood.I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of reading about a character this spineless before. What a pussy! He didn'ttalkso much as hewhined.And the swooning!He was like one of those freaking Fainting Goats!I can't even count how many times he blacked out and fell over. Of course, then he would get feverish and need \"a period of convalescence\" to recover.Again, every episode was recounted with incredible attention to detail.I'm thrilled that I never had to miss a moment of his sweaty brow getting daubed with water!Randomly Inserted Fun Fact:Themonsterquoted Milton in Paradise Lost.Shockingly, I only know this because it was in the appendix, and not because I have any real-life experience with reading that one.Was this the most painfully unnecessary book I've read this year?Yes.Is there a deeper moral to this story?Yes.Some would say, that the monster is a product of a society that refuses to accept someone who is different. Or maybe that Victor Frankenstein was the real monster for not realizing that he had a duty toparentand care for his creation? Perhaps it is meant to point out our obsession with perfection, and our willingness to disregard people who don't meet the standards of beauty as non-human?Some might say any of those things.I,however, learned a far different lesson from Frankenstein.And it's this...Trust no one.Not even someone who (just an example) has been yourBest Friendfordecades!Let's read a classic, Anne. It'll be fun, Anne. We can call each other with updates, Anne. It'll be just like a book club, Anne. Tee-hee!Liar, liar! Pants on fire!I read this whole God-awful book, and you quit after 10 pages!I'm telling your mom!Anyway.Here's the quote that sums up my experience withFrankenstein:\"Blah, blah, blah...in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\""

If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.\"-From the 1994 movieThe worst thing about this novel is how distorted it has become by constant movie adaptations and misinformed ideas about the nature of Frankenstein and his \"monster\". For years, like many others, I thought Frankenstein was the name of that slightly green dude with the bolts in his neck. Nuh-uh.DidFrankensteinscare me? Did it have me staying awake and sleeping with the light on, jumping at every slight creak in the house? Was I terrified of the monster and technology and the dangers of playing God?No.Because the beauty of this story is that it isn't the one so many people think it is. Which is almost my favourite thing about it. This book is not a Halloween kind of story with Halloween kind of monsters.This story is heartbreakingly sad.\"...once I falsely hoped to meet the beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.\"The book offers many interesting avenues of philosophical exploration if one wishes to ponder such things. For example, allusions to religion and Genesis, possible criticisms of using science to \"play God\", and the relationship between creator and creation. All of these things interest me, yes, but it is the painfully human part of this book that has always so deeply affected me.Because the sad thing, the really sad thing, is that pretty much everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... but so many don't know howhumanthe character is. Created as a scientific experiment by an overly ambitious man, he comes into a frightening and hostile world that immediately rejects him on sight. Even the man who made him cannot look upon his creation without feeling horror. It's that same thing that gets me in books every time:things could have been so different. If people had just been a little less judgmental, a little less scared, and a little more understanding.This being, created from different parts of corpses, seeks love and finds hatred, so he instead decides to embrace it. Fuelled by his own rage at the unfairness of the world, he gradually turns towards evil.He belongs in my own little mental category with the likes of Heathcliff and Erik (aka The Phantom of the Opera). Scared, angry villains who were made so by their own unfortunate circumstances.The kind of characters you simultaneously hate and love, but most of all hope they find some kind of peace.So call it science-fiction, if you want. Call it horror, if you must. But this story is brimming with some of the most realistic and almost unbearably moving human emotion that I have ever read.Blog|Leafmarks|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr"

Seems I'm never too old to be wrong. This time, I don't have the excuse that I was forced to read this for high school lit. class. Oh no, this time I read this of my own volition and for fun. Yeah, fun. Kinda like sticking bamboo shoots between my fingernails type of fun. Watching paint dry fun. Going to an Air Supply concert fun.OK, to be fair, I need to tell you what I liked about this....Well, Mary Shelley was a teen when she wrote this. Color me impressed. At 19 I was just looking for my next college boyfriend, not penning the great English classic. Kudos to Mary for that.Otherwise, I can't think of anything to admire in this book, apart from the fact that it's the only book in my reading history where I actually noted EVERY SINGLE PAGE NUMBER and mentally counted down the time I'd be finished.Why did I persist, you may ask? Well, at the point where the pain became mind numbing, I decided to channel my inner John McCain and just survive the torture. Figured it would make me a better, stronger reader. Might even make me enjoy a re-read ofBreaking Dawn....(well, no it wouldn't, but you get the idea).Frankensteinis a classic alright. A classic melodrama. Complete with a wimpy, vaporish, trembling prima donna main character and a pseudo monster whose only sin is being uglier then Bernie Madoff in cell block D. After the upteenth tremble/jerk/gasp/faint/start from our mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, I could only sign in relief that he wasn't a Rabbi about to perform a bris circumcism - oy vey!Were we supposed to be outraged at the monster's killing spree? By the books end, I was merely miffed that the creature murdered the wrong Frankenstein sibling. He would have saved himself a good deal of traveling (and saved me a good deal of suffering) had he snuffed out hismakerbefore he could high-tail it out of the birthing room.I'm sure that the fans of this book will say that I didn't understand the deeper, symbolic nuances of this book, and I'm sure that they are right. At this point in my life, all I know is what I like and don't like in a book, and as far as I'm concerned, this book is unadulterated, mind-numbing crap. But that's just me. Your mileage will vary (as I sincerely hope it does). As for my own mileage, it can best be compared to driving a Ford Pinto in the Indy 500...EDITDue to the efforts of a few Kool-ade drinking trolls who have gotten their big girl/big boy panties in a wad over an almost 200 year old book and can't comment nicely on my review, I am suspending all future comments.Don't like it? Blame the navel grazing trolls for not accepting the concept of aPERSONAL OPINION."

It's in the same vein as thinking of that urban legend about the people who watched the first movie screaming when the train races toward them. \"AAAAAH! I AM IN A THEATER, BUT I'M ABOUT TO GET HIT BY A TRAIN!!! HERE IT COMES! TELL MY WIFE I LOVE HER!\"I highly recommend reading it through that lens. Just thinking about that original audience who thought this was a horror. \"Oh, my stars! A creature of most unholy origin! I daren't think of it!\" Idiots.Again, I digress.This is so beautifully written. It really forces you to slow down and take the story in, just so you don't miss a gorgeous line - which in turn makes you appreciate how many great and beautifully executed themes there are at play.Count me impressed.But again, I'm mostly just thinkin' bout how #relatable Frankenstein is.And also the fact that I can Finally I can be one of those assholes who's like \"Frankenstein is the SCIENTIST, not the monster!!!!\"I'm living the dream.Bottom line: This is nonstop fun and everyone should have (read: read) it.-------------currently-reading updatescan already relate to victor frankenstein as i, too, create massive problems and then avoid dealing with them until the repercussions threaten to destroy my life and even then am kinda like \"ok but do i have to\""

        "user_review": "Mary Wollstonecraft, a teenager, was spending a vacation in Switzerland with her fiancé,Percy Shelley, their mutual friend,Lord Byron, and a few other people. Was the weather gloomy that summer of 1816? Were the companions bored to death? One evening, they challenged each other into writing the scariest ghost story they could come up with. No one remembers what the fellows wrote on that occasion. Except for the young woman's literary creature and the misfortunes of Victor Frankenstein.Since then, what was meant as an entertaining story, rose to the dimension of a myth. So much so that the original novel itself has been covered up by layer upon layer of external imagery, which has very little to do with it — in particular, the heavily made-up face of Boris Karloff in the 1931 unfaithful film adaptation of this book. Nowadays, there are all sorts of adaptations (e.g. Kenneth Branagh's movie, with De Niro, more on that below), parodies (Mel Brook'sYoung Frankenstein), and probably even spooky porn versions.However, Mary Shelley's novel is not so much about ghosts or monsters, as it is a meditation on the Biblical theme of Creation and Fall. Naturally, the idea of creating a living being — using some human technique instead of natural reproduction —, comes from the 16th-century Jewish narrative of theGolemof Prague. The subtle hints and overt references to Milton'sParadise Lostare also quite noticeable — the \"daemon\", rejected from the start as an ugly duckling, learns to read with a copy of this book (?). At any rate,Frankensteinis a brilliant and existential reverie on the theme of God and Satan (Frankenstein and the \"daemon\") and Adam and Eve (Frankenstein and Elizabeth / the monster and the potential lady-monster).Another striking aspect ofFrankenstein's narrative is the Russian-dolls-like structure of the tales: first Captain Walton's letters, which frame the whole novel, then Victor Frankenstein's account and, finally, a tale within the tale, thedaemon's story. This particular form is in keeping with earlier gothic novels and harks back to theOne Thousand and One Nights, to which Mary Shelley might have had access, through Antoine Galland's translation into French. Incidentally, Safie's story, around the middle of the novel (another embedded tale within a tale), has some oriental undertones.Mary Shelley's book is considered one of the earliest examples of the Science Fiction genre. However, there is not much science or technology to speak of inFrankenstein, apart from a few mentions ofParacelsusand a couple of other alchemists and astrologers. The minor references to electricity, magnetism and galvanism are in the spirit of the times. Still,Michael Faraday, who would soon bring significant breakthroughs in these fields, was about the same age as the precocious author ofFrankenstein. Still, the presence of electromagnetism is not only a reference to the myth of Prometheus and the stolen fire. If anything, it expresses a fascination with landscapes: now sunny, beautiful and pleasant; now stormy, sublime and menacing, with ghastly thunderbolts ripping the clouds apart. Mary Shelley had a couple of predecessors —Coleridgeis quoted a few times in her novel —, but that sort of imagery was, by and large, a novelty at the time. It might be interesting to note that while Mary Shelley was writingFrankenstein, Caspar David Friedrich was painting his famousWanderer above the Sea of Fog(see below). This obsession with ominous landscapes would soon become a trope within the romantic and gothic literary tradition (cf. the often ridiculedBulwer-Lytton's \"dark and stormy night\").Frankensteinis also considered an early example of the modern Horror genre. However, the general impression is not exactly a feeling of terror. Rather a romantic and quite often bombastic expression of strong emotions: despair, anguish, despondency, melancholy, misery, wretchedness, affliction, etc., are words that come repeatedly under Mary Shelley's pen. This accumulation of epithets might feel quaint and a little schmaltzy to a modern reader.Even so,Frankensteinhas probably been a significant inspiration to crime mystery novels, such as Stevenson'sDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hydeand later avatars of serial killers on a murderous rampage. It has probably also exerted a strong influence on scary adventure stories, such as Poe'sNarrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, Wells'Island of Doctor Moreau, or Lovecraft'sAt the Mountains of Madness. It might, nowadays, become once more a significant source of inspiration, as contemporary technology explores new forms of sentient and intelligent beings, out of GMO, silicon or some weird combination of the two.Mary Shelley's Frankenstein(1994), directed by Kenneth Branagh, followed Francis Ford Coppola's box-office hitBram Stocker's Dracula(1992). The cast is imposing: De Niro, Branagh, Hulce, Bonham Carter, Holm, Cleese. The screenplay (written by Frank Darabont, who would later developThe Walking DeadTV series) is, for the most part, faithful to Mary Shelley's novel. However, while Coppola'sDraculawas darkly luxurious and decadent, the style of Branagh'sFrankensteinis loud and vehement, at times stomach-churning or downright silly.The biopicMary Shelley(2017) by Haifaa al-Mansour, with Elle Fanning, is primarily a romance, recounting the complicated situation in which the young woman met her husband and how she got to write her masterpiece. The portrayals of Percy Shelley and Lord Byron are rather unflattering."

        "user_review": "It's been fifty years since I had readFrankenstein, and, now—after a recent second reading—I am pleased to know that the pleasures of that first reading have been revived. Once again--just as it was in my teens--I was thrilled by the first glimpse of the immense figure of the monster, driving his sled across the arctic ice, and marveled at the artful use of narrative frames within frame, each subsequent frame leading us closer to the heart of the novel, until we hear the alienated yet articulate voice of the creature himself. In addition, I admired the equally artful way the novel moves backward through the same frames until we again reach the arctic landscape which is the scene of the novel's beginning...and its end.This time through, I was particularly struck with how Mary must have been influenced by the novels of her father. The relentless hounding of one man by another who feels his life has been poisoned by that man's irresponsible curiosity is a theme taken straight out of Godwin'sCaleb Williams, and the cautionary account of a monomaniac who gradually deprives himself of the satisfactions of family, friends and love in pursuit of an intellectual ideal is reminiscent of the alchemist ofSt. Leon. Her prose also is like her father's in her ability to make delicate philosophical distinctions and express abstract ideas, but she is a much better writer than he: her sentences are more elegant and disciplined, and her descriptive details more aptly chosen and her scenes more effectively realized.The conclusion of the novel seems hasty and incomplete, but perhaps that is because the concept ofFrankensteinis so revolutionary that no conclusion could have seemed satisfactory. At any rate, this fine novel has given birth to a host of descendants, and—unlike Victor Frankenstein—is a worthy parent of its many diverse creations."

        "user_review": "''Man,' I cried, 'how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!''For over 200 yearsFrankensteinby Mary Shelley has captured our minds and toyed with our fears, entering the canon of classic while remaining as relevant and thought provoking a metaphor as science progresses onward. It is certainly worthy of the lasting fame, being an exquisite blend of gothic horror and Romantic morality that delves into philosophical and allegorical inquiries in an endlessly engaging narrative that had me reading late into the night with a fervor to reach the end. It is a story we likely all know, and not much new to say someone hasn't already said and better, but even still I was fascinated by every detail, with its fabulist monster story, the nested framing of two men on a quest in the arctic, the epistolary narrative, the plots of murderous vengeance and, of course, the fall from innocence with the damnation of ambition. This is also a story about how being a deadbeat dad passes along trauma that reacts negatively and is rather terrifying with its massive monster that moves fast and kills hard. This cautionary creation tale of catastrophe forces us to confront the grotesqueries of humanity grappling with life and death, and question what is truly monstrous.'Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.'This is a book where the story about its creation is just as compelling as the novel itself. Written when Mary Shelley was 19, this would arrive on the scene under high expectations to see what the young writer of notable literary heritage (her father wasWilliam Godwinand her late mother the feminist writer and activistMary Wollstonecraft) would produce. 'My husband,' she writes in an introduction, referring toPercy Bysshe Shelley, 'was from the first very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enroll myself on the page of fame.' The novel sprang into creation supposedly during a dream (not unlike her doctor Frankenstein's prophetic dream of creation) afterLord Byronproposed to his friends they each should write a ghost story while they were allstuck indoors on a retreat togetherat Lake Geneva. This same retreat would also birth the novelThe VampyrebyJohn William Polidori, who based his villain on Byron himself becauseLord Byron was kind of insufferable. And a deadbeat dad, not unlike Victor Frankenstein. The novel itself can be read as a commentary on the experience of writing it, something she teases in her introduction about the creative experience of an artist and to which she writes that 'I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper.' Unlike her doctor, there is a sense of care over her creation. Now, onward!'To examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death.'This book is sort of the antidote to those cliche inspirational office posters about ambition everyone had in the 90s, because here we find ambition to drip into arrogance and basically create calamity. Framed from the perspective of Cpt. Walton as he attempts to reach the North Pole—and fails—we hear the story of another man who's blinded by his own ambition until it is too late. Doctor Victor Frankenstein's story is a chilling fall-from-grace story, beginning with a sweet adolescence that slowly turns to the grotesque along a path of bloodied corpses of innocent people to chronicle his own loss of innocence. The spark to this is the early death of his mother, coupled with his reading of scientific books at university (self-education through books is mirrored as well through his monster), amalgamating into an idea with the best intentions to 'renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.' We all know the maxim that good intentions are the paving stones to Hell, however.'Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed.'While we tend to just remember the Doctor's last name, the full title of the book isFrankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus,and here we begin to understand why fire and light is such a frequent symbol. As Prometheus gave fire to humans and was punished for it, we see Frankenstein attempt to 'pour a torrent of light into our dark world' by conquering death and creating life (with electric shock instead of fire but close enough), something that will be his own undoing. It is only natural, drawing on ideas of the Romantics that nature is the pinnacle of good and perfection and since he 'collected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame,' to create and give life to his creation, therefore the manufactured (see also: \"unnatural\") creation must also be profane and Frankenstein shall be punished. You know, the whole 'don't play god' argument. The creature wrecks havoc on Frankenstein's life as 'the cold stars shone in mockery,' and the barren Arctic is a sort of Hell (devoid of fire and warmth) where Victor inevitably meets his demise.Yet Victor never views his ambitions as unnatural (him and the Captain being figuratively blinded by their ambitions functioning as another fire/light metaphor), and even at the end he says to Walton 'I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.' He sees no ethical dilemma in his manufacturing of life, his fears stem from the supposed hideousness of his creation—'ugly…a thing such as Dante could not have conceived'—and then later the string of murders. 'A new species would bless me as its creator and source,' Victor writes, propping himself up as a paternal godlike figure, 'no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs,' however he fails as a father to his creation by abandoning it. He does not even give the creation a name, even when hunting it after the multiple murders. This is key, as in fairy tales naming something is a way to take away it's power (think Rumpelstiltskin being defeated by guessing his name). 'I think of the act of naming as diagnosis,'Rebecca Solnitwrites in her essayCall Them by Their True Names, 'once you name a disorder, you may be able to connect to the community afflicted with it, or build one.' Seeing as the creation turns to evil deeds due to a feeling of isolation and being othered, this idea of naming, of giving a space, makes the lack of naming or any parental care more emphasized as a fatal misstep. So not only does Victor have his fall from grace for trying to play god, but also failing in even the most basics of paternal support.'Am i to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?'Let's turn now to Frankenstein's monster. Left to his own devices, this giant manufactured from death finds he is met with fear and misunderstanding at every turn. While he seems to only have pure intentions at first, he is pushed into solitude and begins to lash out, especially at his creator (definitely some religious symbolism there). While he may be manmade, he is also very human all the way down to emotions and existential crises of selfhood:'I was dependent on none and related to none. The path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.���The creature conducts his autodidactic education mostly through reading and watching a family interact. Among his books are Goethe'sThe Sorrows of Young Werther, and Milton'sParadise Lost, the latter being very influential on his impressions of the world and themself. From Milton he reads himself first as Adam in the creation story, but later identifies with Satan instead:'I am thy creature: I ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.'Though he also notes that 'yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone' Milton pops up everywhere in his sections, such as the monsters statement that 'evil thenceforth became my good,' which paraphrases Milton's line 'Evil be thou my good.' In anessay on the novel,Joyce Carol Oatesargues that the monster's surprise at his reflection in the water is not a reference to Narcissus as is typically claimed, but instead a reference to Eve from Paradise Lost: 'Of sympathy and love; there I had fixt / Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire.' This, she argues, makes the monster a sort of reverse holy trinity of creation instead of creator, speaking from Milton's Adam, Eve and Satan as opposed to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. There is another interesting reversal that Shelley plays with, somethingWilliam Veeder callsthe 'negative Oedipus.' The monster kills Elizabeth to get to his 'father', Frankenstein, while the death of the doctor's mother is his motivation to play Holy Father. At all times Shelley constructs a duality of parenthood and horror.While the classic human vs nature and the whole ethical conundrum is fascinating, it is the look at the person under the extreme absence of love and support that grabs me most. On one hand it is an intriguing look at the horrors of isolation and being othered, but it also makes me wonder how narratives like this became concrete in collective consciousness and instill further fear into people against anything different. Is this also central to ideas of xenophobia and pushbacks against equality, the fear that if we allow the marginalized to have space they will harm the people-of-status-quo/colonizers as a state of revenge? Thinking about it that way is frustrating and sad, the idea that those who have been harmed continue to be so out of fear for the repercussions, which only furthers the othering and marginalizing. So I guess that's something to consider too and work on undoing in social consciousness. And a reminder to give love and empathy. The creation only wanted to be understood, given empathy and space, given love.'I could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other.'Now the question here proposed by Shelley is, who is the 'true' monster? The man who reached for the profane and abandoned it into a life of torment turning toward evil, or the misunderstood being thrust into the world already considered an abomination and becoming 'malicious because I am miserable.' Its ethical quandaries like this that make this a fantastic classroom choice or one to toss and turn with for days. The National Theater had an excellentstage adaptationwhere the two leads, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, alternated roles as Frankenstein and Frankenstein's monster to further interrogate this question. Though perhaps the creation says it best: 'Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!'In aninterview with LitHub, authorJeanette Wintersonsays ofFrankensteinthat 'we are the first generations to read it not as gothic horror but as contemporary reality.' Where Shelley's doctor steals body parts to create life with electricity, in our modern day we are pushing closer towards digital AI and already have manufactured body parts to replace our own. Even just this week it has been in the news that scientistshave revived cells in dead pig's brains and other organs, something that could be a breakthrough in increasing viable organ transplants. Perhaps there is something to learn from Victor's failures as we consider how to usher new systems into the world, such asissues of bias in algorithms, or if an AI were to learn from us, what are we reflecting back to ourselves. Perhaps this is why Mary Shelley's classic has endured all this time; with each new advancement in science many fear a Frankenstein unleashing his monster and with each ambition of our own we fear what may happen if we are blinded by our desires. Mary Shelley captures this perfectly and I was surprised how engaging this book was and how relevant it still felt all these years later.4.5/5'Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.'"

That´s theUnderlying ethical, philosophical partBesides faith, there is an open question about identity, soul, consciousness, and especially death. Something so deeply build into our fragile flesh systems that it freaks us out each time we are confronted with it. Thinking about the implications is what Frankenstein is about, mixed withBorderline science and the question of who is really evilMad scientists are certainly as old as time, although I can´t choose if a crazy priest vivisecting human sacrifices is cooler than a Star Wars/Trek antagonist letting robots and AI do all the dirty work.

A reason for that might be that it´s much easier to create a stereotypical work without much depth than to show the complex inner lives of all protagonists and antagonists.Integrating this element opens up many ethical implications regarding who the real monster is, leading toToo many open questions that can´t be answered easilySo instead of being an action filled or thrilling horror fantasy novel, Frankenstein is much deeper than one would expect. Because, honestly, didn´t many people reading it expect something like a typical horror novel and were surprised by the density of wtf moments letting one stop reading to question humanities and life itself?Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "REREAD UPDATE - September 2018:One of my bookclubs (Click to check out Reading List Completists) is reading this for September 2018. I figure it was a good time for a reread since it was one of my favorites and it has been over 20 years since I read it.I did enjoy it again this time and it stands up to the 5 star review and designation of classic. There were a few slow parts - mainly when Dr. Frankenstein would stop the narrative to wax poetical about something - but, not enough t take a way from my overall enjoyment.I still recommend this for everyone and be sure to check out my full original review below.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is definitely one of my favorite books I was required to read in High School. Also, it is my favorite of the classic horror novels. It is perfectly written, suspenseful, and is a bit more thought provoking than scary. One of the best ways I can compare it to other classic horror novels is to Dracula - which I read recently. Dracula has so much repetitive filler that you do not find in Frankenstein, which is the main reason I find Frankenstein to be a more enjoyable book.Also, I would say that this is more a novel of the human condition than an actual horror novel. Some terrifying things happen, but it is the monster within all of us that may end up being more terrifying!Funny side story: when I read this in High School, it was around the same time that the Kenneth Branaugh adaptation came out at the theaters. We were all encouraged to go see it and found it pretty close to the source material. What was amusing was that Time Magazine had a review of the movie bashing it as untrue to the source material and how disappointed Shelley would be that the Boris Karlovian depiction of a lurching, flattop monster with bolts in its neck was ignored for a more serious drama movie. WHAT!? Time Magazine, for goodness sakes, published an article that claims to know the content of the book but is completely wrong and does it while bashing a movie that did a pretty good job with it!? I mean, it it is okay if you prefer the old time movie version of Frankenstein - and it is a classic - but to make definitive statements that are completely wrong in what is supposed to be a well thought of publication (not your typical tabloid supermarket checkout fodder), that is just too much!We need a copy editor over here!"

        "user_review": "LA MELODIA DEL DOLOREEcco il primo Frankenstein della storia del cinema: 1910, è un cortometraggio muto, americano, regia di James, Searley Dawley.Sono passati duecento anni, due secoli tra questo 2018 e quella notte del 1818.Sono la tua creatura, ricordalo: avrei dovuto essere il tuo Adamo, e sono invece l'angelo caduto che tu hai allontanato dalla gioia senza colpa alcuna da parte sua.Dieci anni dopo, 1920, sempre epoca di cinema muto, il primo Frankenstein italiano: la regia è di Eugenio Testa, Umberto Guarracino interpreta il Mostro (questo è l'unico fotogramma sopravvissuto del film).Non si può dire che Mary Shelley sia nata sotto i migliori auspici.Figlia deidue più grandi uomini del loro tempo(definizione che credo sia di Mario Praz), la madre Mary Wollstonecraft, probabilmente la prima femminista della storia, e il padre William Godwin, intellettuale e filosofo radicale, la futura signora Shelley nacque il 30 agosto al posto del figlio maschio che era atteso e per il quale era già pronto il nome di William junior.Il 30 agosto venne alla luce Mary, la madre si ammalò, dieci giorni di febbre, e, il 10 settembre morì.Segno indelebile sulla piccola Mary che probabilmente da questo momento acquistò la predisposizione al dolore e la sensibilità esasperata. Unastoria più romantica d'ogni possibile romanzo, come Mary stessa definì la sua vita.Sembra che ogni giorno si recasse sulla tomba della madre: a piangere, ma a sedici anni anche a promettere amore eterno al suo principe, o meglio, al suo poeta azzurro, Percy Bysshe Shelley.Il Frankenstein che ha cambiato la storia: 1931, regia di James Whale, così appare Boris Karloff nei panni della creatura dopo quattro ore quotidiane di trucco. Da qui in avanti l'aspetto fisico del mostro si rifarà a questo modello.Per continuare sul terreno fecondo alla sua narrativa impregnata disorrowful mood, Mary a 19 anni ha già perso la prima figlia, dopo solo un mese dalla nascita; partorisce un maschio, che muore a tre anni; ha un'altra femmina, che muore a un anno.Più o meno nello stesso periodo, la sorella maggiore Fanny, figlia di padre diverso, si suicida con il laudano. Nel giro di poco si suicida anche la prima moglie di Shelley, preparando così la strada al matrimonio tra la scrittrice e il poeta.Mary riuscì a seppellire anche il suo amato Percy, che morì annegato.Il romanzo di Polidori fu scritto contemporaneamente a quello della Shelley.È proprio in questo arco di tempo, segnato da morte e suicidio (tutte morti premature, se esiste un tipo di morte che non lo sia), che Mary Shelley partorisce il suo romanzo più famoso,Frankenstein, or, the modern Prometheus, tra il 1816 e il 1817, tra i diciannove e i venti anni (fu pubblicato nel 1818).La genesi è aneddoto piuttosto noto: Mary è convinta da sua sorella Claire (Clairmont: stessa madre ma padre differente), che all'epoca era l'amate di Lord Byron, a seguirla a Ginevra dove affittano Villa Diodati. La comitiva è composta da Mary e Shelley, Claire e Byron, il medico e scrittore John Polidori. Tempo piovoso, fu l'anno definito \"senza estate\", gli amici leggono molto, soprattutto storie tedesche di fantasmi e ilParadiso Perdutodi John Milton. Alla fine (solo tre giorni), Mary produce il Frankenstein, Byron frammenti di un romanzo, e PolidoriIl Vampiro, il primo vampiro moderno.La versione cinematografica che trovo più prossima al romanzo della Shelley è questa, del 1994: regia di Kenneth Branagh, Robert De Niro interpreta la mostruosa creatura.Si direbbe che Mary tolga la vita a chi la genera (la morte di parto di sua madre) e generi chi in vita non sa restare (i tre figli): nascere è direttamente collegato al morire, che col Frankenstein diventa assassinio.E Mary si sente contemporaneamente sia il creatore Frankenstein che la mostruosa creatura: Victor Frankenstein, lo scienziato e costruttore impegnato a riprodurre la vita (dalla morte, servendosi di parti di persone già morte) rifiuta la creatura che ha messo al mondo, e la creatura rifiutata si trasforma in agente di distruzione e morte, con metodo, ostinazione, e si direbbe quasi passione, si impegna a distruggere la famiglia del suo autore.Nel senso che, se la famiglia non lo vuole, il neonato (di dimensioni e proporzioni mostruose) eliminerà la famiglia.Kenneth Branagh, regista e interprete, nei panni (pantaloni) del dottor Victor Frankenstein.Viene da rintracciare una genesi del pensiero materno in materia di femminilità nel rifiuto della creatura al momento del concepimento: invece di provare affetto in qualche modo 'paterno', Frankenstein classifica la sua creazione come mostruosa sulla base del solo aspetto fisico e la respinge immediatamente (rifiuta, rinnega…).Eppure il 'neonato' non può essere malvagio fin dal primo momento, non può essere nato cattivo.Ed ecco qui a confronto la creatura e il suo creatore, Frankenstein/Branagh e Mostro/De Niro.Victor Frankenstein, medico e scienziato, è il moderno Prometeo: che ruba il fuoco della vita, ruba la vita alla stessa morte: la materia morta si trasforma in energia viva. Orrenda metamorfosi!Ma se è Frankenstein a sfidare dio, è sulla creatura che si scatena la punizione divina!È la stessa Shelley a essere, per così dire, schizofrenica con i suoi due personaggi: per quanto il lettore dovrebbe tifare in automatico per la creatura che è innocente, è una tabula rasa, dato che è appena nata, e certo non responsabile della sua nascita (come non lo è nessun figlio), la Shelley ci spinge (forse perfino di più) a prendere le parti del dottor Frankenstein, ci vuol convincere che la creatura è un mostro prima di tutto per il suo aspetto fisico (brutta, antiestetica).Jekyll e Hyde con settanta anni d'anticipo.Non poteva mancare il capolavoro, \"young Frankenstein\" di Mel Brooks (1974). Qui, Aigor \"appena morto\".Ma è un mostro umano, probabilmente il primo, e sin dalla sua prima apparizione il terrore si mescola alla compassione, perché la Creatura, che ruba il nome al suo creatore diventando Frankenstein tout court, è da subito un infelice, una vittima, un diverso, qualcuno con cui possiamo identificarci.Talmente umano da diventare sovrumano: la sua dimensione sessuale è elemento di curiosità e attrazione, almeno sullo schermo. Si pensi a Udo Kier che si accoppia con Dalila Di Lazzaro inIl mostro è in tavola, barone Frankensteinprodotto da Andy Warhol, oppure ad Aldo Maccione macho trash inFrankenstein all'italiana, al Frank-N-Furter in guêpière e paillettes inThe Rocky Horror Picture Show, o al tenerissimo mostro creatura di Mel Brooks dotato di grosso schwanzstuck.Creatore e creatura, padre e figlio, Gene Wilder e Peter Boyle.Tutti gli uomini odiano gli sciagurati. Quanto allora devo essere odiato io, di gran lunga il più miserabile tra gli esseri viventi. Pure tu, mio creatore, detesti e disprezzi me, tua creatura, a cui sei legato da vincoli che solo l'annientamento di uno di noi può sciogliere.PSI film dove compare Frankenstein, o meglio, la sua creatura, il Mostro, sono decine, io ne ho contati oltre settanta, incluse le parodie (su tutte, Frankenstein Jr), i cross-over (Frankenstein contro l'Uomo Lupo) , le parodie cross-over (Fracchia contro Dracula).Tim Curry indimenticabile Dr Frank-N-Furter in the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\", il primo artefice bisessuale della \"creatura\"."

        "user_review": "Mucho se ha hablado deFrankenstein. Se interpreta como una crítica al desarrollo científico, cuando este sobrepasa el curso natural de las cosas; se interpreta como una crítica a la religión y nuestra relación con Dios; hasta se ha dicho que es una alegoría a los miedos que surgen durante un embarazo. Todas estas lecturas probablemente sean correctas, pero omiten lo más básico. Lo que hace aFrankensteinuna obra atiborrada de humanidad, con interpolaciones que abordan la desventura a través de la complejidad de tres voces que derraman soledad y melancolía.Si intentara tratar aFrankensteindesde lo más superficial, acabaría hablando sobre la profundidad del espíritu humano y los peligros que conlleva un uso desmedido de sus facultades cognitivas o la influencia del sentimiento en sus actos. No se puede discutir este título sin penetrar en lo más reflexivo de nuestra naturaleza.Frankenstein, en su perfil más somero, abarca temas que atraviesan la columna vertebral de lo que nos hace seres en constante conflicto de moralidades y en una interminable búsqueda por pertenecer y ser reconocidos, como asimismo incluye el derecho a ser amados por al menos alguien en la vida.A partir de un análisis ligero,Frankensteintrata la venganza y el abandono. Son las dos cuestiones principales que hacen esta historia una historia con movimiento. La venganza desde el arrebato y la venganza desde el rechazo. También cabe destacar que es admirable la caracterización del Creador y su Criatura, y sus interminables pugnas por quién posee la más dañina amenaza; ya que, si lo vemos de esa forma, y teniendo en cuenta la completa implicación de las circunstancias en la novela, ¿qué es más nocivo, el rechazo injustificado o el asesinato como consecuencia de una iniquidad anterior?La denominada Criatura, Demonio, Engendro o Monstruo es de los personajes más humanos con los que me he topado. Es suntuosa la carga emotiva, el abigarramiento en el interior de un ser que fue engendrado por ciencia mal utilizada. Un vínculo irónico entre un hombre que quería ser dios y un ser que siempre quiso ser hombre. Para mí esta es la crítica más punzante de Mary Shelley. Repudia que nos dejemos llevar por las apariencias en vez de detenernos a pensar en lo que estamos haciendo. La egolatría, la soberbia y el prejuicio son lo más lamentable de nuestra conducta como humanidad, y esas condiciones danzaron alrededor del llamado Monstruo y acabaron destruyendo la bondad más pura, que, prácticamente, ni había llegado a florecer.No voy a omitir la prosa, que acompaña a la perfección la calidad de este libro. No hay mejor pluma que la que te abraza y te lleva consigo en un viaje por el tiempo y el espacio hacia su historia. Mientras leíaFrankenstein, me sentía allí, junto a Víctor y a su Criatura, percibía la realidad que me rodeaba como falsa, como un pobre bosquejo de lo que estaba leyendo, y creía que mi pertenencia radicaba en el siglo XVII. La ambientación de Shelley es tan estupenda que fue capaz de sobrepasar los límites de la narrativa e invadir el mundo real. Excelente trabajo de la autora. Su estilo de escritura es de los puntos más fuertes del texto.Frankensteinse ha transformado en una de mis obras favoritas. Su retrato de la soledad, el aislamiento forzado, la pérdida y la derrota es sublime. Un relato que se construye sobre lo emocional y que tiene sus raíces en lo más hondo del alma humana."

        "user_review": "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, Mary ShelleyFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is a novel written by English author Mary Shelley (1797–1851) that tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a grotesque, sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment.Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20. Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in France in 1823.Frankenstein tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a sapient creature in an unorthodox scientific experiment.Frankenstein is a frame story written in epistolary form.It documents a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville.Robert Walton is a failed writer who sets out to explore the North Pole in hopes of expanding scientific knowledge.During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure.A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew.Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning.The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه دسامبر سال 1995میلادی؛ تاریخ خوانش دوم: روز نوزدهم نوامیر سال 2011میلادیعنوان: فرانکشتاین؛ مری شلی؛ مترجم: جعفر مدرس صادقی؛ تهران، نشر مرکز، 1374؛ متن کوتاه شده در 224ص؛ شابک 9643051064؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 19ممترجم: محسن سلیمانی؛ تهران؛ قدیانی، چاپ چهارم 1392؛ در 326ص؛ شابک 9789645366184؛عنوان: فرانکنشتاین یا پرومته نوین؛ نویسنده: مری شلی؛ مترجم: کاظم فیروزمند؛ تهران، نشر مرکز، چاپ دوم 1389؛ در 262ص؛ شابک 9789642131037؛فرانکنشتاین، دانشمند جوانی جاه‌ طلب، و جویای نام است، که جانوری زنده، به شکل انسان، و با ابعاد کمی بزرگ‌تر از یک آدم معمولی، و با ریخت و قیافه‌ ای زشت، و مخوف می‌سازد؛ که همه، از جمله سازنده‌ اش، از دست او، و شرارت‌هایش می‌گریزند؛ اما به تدریج خود آن هیولا، به «فرانکنشتاین» نامدار شده، و این نام، اسم عامی شده، برای آفریده های ویرانگری که از اختیار آفرینشگر خویش نیز، خارج میشوند، و حتی آفریننده نیز، توان مهار نیروی ویرانگر آنها را ندارد؛ «مری شلی»، نویسنده‌ ی این اثر، همسر «شلی»، شاعر بزرگ رمانتیک «بریتانیایی» بودند، و رمان‌های دیگری نیز بنوشته اند، اما تنها همین اثر ایشان بود، که شهرت ماندگار و جهانگیر یافت؛رمانها: «فرانکنشتاین (1818میلادی)»؛ «ماتیلدا (1819 میلادی) - رمان کوتاه»؛ «آخرین نفر (1826میلادی) - در یک سه‌ گانه ی داستانی علمی-تخیلی را روایت می‌کند: سده ی بیست و یکم میلادی است، بیماری طاعون نسل بشر را از بین برده و تنها یک نفر باقی مانده‌ است، آخرین نفر»؛ «والپرگا (1823میلادی) - ماجرایی از زندگی در ایتالیای سده های میانی میلادی را نقل می‌کند»؛ «بخت و اقبال پرکین واربِک (1830میلادی)»؛ «لادور (1835میلادی) - همچنین با عنوان (بیوه زیبا) نیز شناخته می‌شود»؛ «فالکنر (1837 میلادی)؛داستانهای کوتاه: «یادبود»؛ «سفرنامه»؛ «تاریخ شش هفته ‌ای»؛ «وقایع بزرگ و فوق‌العاده»؛ «ولگردی در آلمان و ایتالیا در سال‌های 1840میلادی، 1842میلادی و 1843میلادی»؛شرح حال: شرح زندگانی برجسته ‌ترین ادبا و علما، و ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 12/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "\"It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs…\"-\tMary Shelley,FrankensteinFrankensteinis a marvelous example of a book that escaped from its author and took on an entirely new existence beyond the boundaries of the page. There is an elegant symmetry to this. After all, the novel concerns a \"monster\" or \"daemon\" that slips away from its creator, the scientist Victor Frankenstein, to cause havoc in the world.Today, when we think of Frankenstein – or more accurately, about scientist Victor Frankenstein's never-named creature – we are likely imagining something other than the somewhat vaguely-described human-ish thing in Mary Shelley's 1818 horror classic. Unmoored from its literary roots, the Frankenstein's monster we call forth in our minds is probably closer in conception to Boris Karloff's famous version from the 1930s: square-headed and scarred, with metal bolts in the neck. This is a visage that is ubiquitous every October, found in movies, on television, and selling Halloween candy.Part of the fun of readingFrankensteinis to see how far this cobbled-together man has traveled from Shelley's original iteration. Frankly, this was probably theonlyfun I had, asFrankenstein, for all its bursts of creativity, its sudden flashes of discrete violence, is a bit of a wordy drag. It is fully a piece from the Romantic era, from the overwrought emotional excesses of its characters, to the gorgeous, travelogue-like descriptions of the Alps.***According to Shelley – in an 1831 forward to the revised text –Frankensteinhad its genesis in a spontaneous parlor game between famed wordsmiths, of which she took part. Only eighteen at the time, Shelley was vacationing in Lake Geneva with her husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the famous Lord Byron. Byron apparently suggested they each write a ghost story, since the weather was too lousy to do much else. Mary Shelley's contribution, according to this lore, wasFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. The short story she began in a cold and dispiriting Switzerland eventually became a full-length novel that is currently enjoying a two-hundred year afterlife.***As an aside, Shelley's life, and her relationship with the doomed Percy, is worth exploring. There is free love, unfounded suggestions that Percy pennedFrankenstein, and tragedy aplenty.***Frankensteinutilizes an epistolary framing device, both beginning and ending with a series of \"letters\" from an adventurous mariner to his sister. Initially, I was entirely uncertain what these missives had to do with Frankenstein and his monster. As a result, the novel started extremely slow for me, as I found myself reading only a couple pages at a time before losing interest, never really finding the hook. Ultimately – as you can see – I pushed through, but it was only much later, when the letters reappear at the end, that everything clicked into place (and I went back and reread the opening gambit).Once this prelude is out of the way, we begin the main part of the narrative, which is told in the first-person by the emotionally labile Frankenstein. For reasons put down to obsession, young Frankenstein is preoccupied with creating new life. Working alone and in fanatical devotion to his goal, Frankenstein begins assembling histhing:I collected bones from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation: my eye-balls were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.It does not –shouldnot – spoil anything to say that Frankenstein is successful in his endeavors, at least up to a point.***The monster or creature or daemon or whatever you'd like to call it – just don't call it Frankenstein – comes to life and immediately begins to torment Victor. Unlike the shambling, slow-moving, slow-witted monster of modern pop culture, Shelley's creature moves faster than the zombies in28 Days Later, climbs mountains like Sly Stallone inCliffhanger, and is an exceptionally advanced autodidact, not only teaching himself to speak, but to readParadise LostandPlutarch's Lives.Frankenstein and his monster engage in a globetrotting game of cat-and-mouse, which might have been exciting, if not written in the overly formal, cluttered style of the early nineteenth century. Shelley tells this story broadly, seldom taking any time to build a scene, ratchet up suspense, or pay off a plot arc. Instead, through the excitable, often operatically frantic voice of Frankenstein, we are given broad characters (Elizabeth, for instance, seems to be a forerunner of Dickens's saintly – and boring – Esther Summerson), unexciting action, and pointedly telegraphed plot points. It says something that the high point ofFrankensteinis a story-within-a-story (in true Conradian fashion) told by the monster itself.Honestly, I have a predisposition against books written in the archaic-feeling style ofFrankenstein. It is something I always thought I'd grow out of as I aged. Alas, it has been two decades since high school, and my bias against writers who usetheeandthystill abides.That is not to say I recommend skipping this novel, because I don't. I also did not hate it, not by any means. The story works better in summary than in execution, and it requires close attention, but it is a genuine triumph of imagination. It is also far more polished and thematically coherent than Bram Stoker's later attempt at Gothic horror (which has also turned out to be undying).***Certain books have meanings beyond the composition of sentences and the contours of a storyline. Shelley created something inFrankensteinthat has endured for a couple centuries, and will likely live on forever, as long as people read. For that reason – if notonlyfor that reason – this classic example of a thinking person's horror novel is worth checking out."

        "user_review": "I have a favourite Kate Beaton strip framed up in our book room:(Full-size imagehere.)Mary was – what? – eighteen years old when she went on this famous holiday to Lake Geneva with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron and Byron's physician. She was calling herself 'Mrs Shelley', though they had not yet married – Percy was still married to someone else.The surroundings were familiar. The last time Mary and Percy had come to Switzerland had been during their elopement a couple of years earlier, accompanied by her sister, who was also in love with him; Mary had got pregnant, but the baby girl was born prematurely and died in February 1815. Now they were back, trying to put the past behind them and enjoy a holiday with Byron, who at the time was sleeping with Mary's stepsister. Percy's first wife would soon be out of the picture, found drowned in the Serpentine in an 'advanced state of pregnancy' before the year was out. Mary's other sister Fanny also drowned herself that year, 1816, also pining for Percy.So it was in the midst of this complex love-dodecahedron that the holidaymakers, their festive plans foiled by constant rain, held their famous competition to write a ghost story. The result is something very different from its image in popular culture. Instead of the smoke of Victorian London, we have the Swiss Alps and the Orkney Islands; instead of Igor and bolts through the neck, we have meditations on personal autonomy, scientific responsibility and eugenics.Frankensteinis overwritten and the narrative structure is a bit odd – she was still a teenager when she wrote it, let's not forget – but thematically, it's fascinating. I'm surprised by how few reviews I've read touch on what seems to me to be the intensely female experiences that it obliquely comments on. The confusion of bringing a creature into the world only to feel horror and revulsion towards it. The stress of releasing it into a hostile and uncaring world. And perhaps most of all, the deep sympathy shown with someone who feels that their body is not their own, that it is somehow owned and regulated by others. A body that one is taught by society to hate. The monster's feelings are unimportant, because he was created by a man for the man's own gratification.Mary quotes her beloved Percy Bysshe Shelley, unattributively, when Dr Frankenstein first spots his creature up on the Mer de Glace. She uses the final two stanzas from 'Mutability'. For me though it's the beautiful first stanza that better expresses the ferocious intensity of Mary and her circle of friends and lovers, surrounded as they all seemed to be by imminent, premature death:We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soonNight closes round, and they are lost forever…As they all were. But the writing they left behind will last as long as English literature is read, and for all of its problemsFrankensteinis among that select group."

Ante la negativa de su creador de crear otro \"monstruo\", el monstruo se vengó.Novela de personajes, que en un momento dado no sé si quién me daba más pena si el creado o el creador, ambos arrepentidos de distintos actos.Fantásticos los personajes secundarios, tanto la familia de Víctor como la familia con la que aprende su criatura o el capitán del barco.La ambientación gótica le dota a la novela de escenas terroríficas, cuando la criatura cobra vida, cuando huye herido tras haber salvado la vida de una niña que se ahogaba...En cierto momento me ha recordado a \"los miserables\" ¿quién es más miserable? ¿quién es así por su propia naturaleza o quién por las circunstancias acaba así?¿Las circunstancias que te rodean sirven de excusa para realizar esos atroces actos?Ambos parecen las dos caras de una misma moneda o al menos eso me parece a mí.No tengo un personaje favorito, son todos, y lo que más me ha gustado es la narración es casi como una novela epistolar, a veces sientes una narración pausada, tranquila, con matices que parecen versos con tintes oscuros y góticosTrata temas como los límites de la ciencia y la ética, la responsabilidad, la soledad, el amor, el egoísmo..., con muchos matices y muchas lecturas.Un libro muy recomendable."

        "user_review": "Sometimes literature stands for little. The Tambora volcano eruption in 1815 completely changed Europe's climate, particularly between 1816 and 1817. It led to almost glacial periods in the Alps. Around this time, friends Shelley and Byron traveled around Switzerland on vacation. The lousy weather obliges them to often remain secluded in their chalet, with, like a favorite pastime, to invent extraordinary stories. During one of these evenings, it would be born, from the imagination of Mary Shelley, the character of Frankenstein and his creature - feeding on romantic, gothic, and fantastic literature, with the scientific spirit in vogue at the time of the early 19th century. It remained to polish the plot with the help of Percy Shelley. He then relayed by cinema and the high physics of Boris Karloff. And this is how a myth is born!What remains today of good literary work? The plot is very moralizing. Like Prometheus, can a man play the Demiurge? The good feelings, the good, and the bad repeated to excess weigh down the story. Too many lengths on existential themes end up harming the action. From my point of view, this romanticism no longer passes for today's reader.Following the protagonists' wanderings, there remains a glimpse of Europe during the pivotal period between the 18th and 19th centuries, harmonious and fascinating descriptions of majestic landscapes, and a plot that retains an individual interest despite everything.To read to immerse yourself in the times."

Jamás volveré a crear otro ser como t��, con tu misma deformidad y tus maldades.-Quise razonar contigo, pero has demostrado que no quieres. Recuerda que soy yo quien tiene el poder. Te consideras desgraciado, pero piensa que sólo yo puedo hacerte tan desdichado que la luz del día te resultará odiosa. Tú eres mi creador, pero yo soy tu dueño. ¡Obedece! Ten cuidado porque a nada temo, y eso me convierte en poderoso.\"Fue en abril, durante el verano del año 1816 en Villa Diodati, una localidad Ginebra que el más famoso y más romántico de los Románticos, el poeta inglés, Lord Byron, organizó un desafío literario para escribir el cuento más terrorífico que se les ocurriera, junto a su médico personal, John Polidori, el célebre poeta inglés Percy Bysshe Shelley y su amante, Mary Goodwin, quien más tarde se convertiría en su esposa y con nuevo apellido le daría chispa a la vida de la criatura más emblemática, conocida y arquetípica en la historia de la literatura: el monstruo creado por el científico Víctor Frankenstein.Los relatos de Byron, \"El entierro\", y de Percy Shelley \"Los asesinos\", están inacabados y por ende, es imposible saber cuál podría haber sido su final.El mejor relato de todos es del de John Polidori, \"El vampiro\", que es el disparador de lo que en la actualidad conoceríamos a través de Bram Stoker con \"Drácula\", y esto se debe a que \"El vampiro\" anticipa a la inmortal novela de Stoker 56 años antes de su publicación.Pero sería Mary Shelley quien al final terminaría ganando y todo surge a partir de un extraño y profético sueño que tuvo en ese castillo, luego de leer entre todos distintos cuentos de los más afamados escritores alemanes, siendo E.T.A. Hoffmann el referente más importante.A la mañana siguiente, cuando despertó les contó lo que soñó:\"Vi a un pálido estudiante de arte impías, de rodillas junto al ser que había ensamblado. Vi el horrendo fantasma de un hombre que estaba tendido, y luego, por obra de algún ingenio poderoso, manifestaba signos de vida y se agitaba con movimiento torpe y semivital…\"La escena nos lleva directamente al momento en el que Víctor Frankenstein, en esa tormentosa noche demencial, casi de la misma manera que en el cuento \"El sueño\" que la autora escribiera dos años antes, exclama que si criatura está viva:\"Era ya la una de la noche. Una lluvia lúgubre golpeaba los cristales y la vela estaba a punto de apagarse cuando, iluminado por el resplandor de la luz casi consumida, vi que el ojo amarillento y mortecino de la criatura se abría; respiró con dificultad y agitó sus miembros con un movimiento convulso.\"Increíblemente y como si fuera una trágica maniobra del destino, ese encuentro tendría un final funesto: en 1821 John Polidori se suicidaría pero le sobrevivirá su inmortal cuento y Percy Bysshe Shelley moriría ahogado a orillas del lago Leman, dos meses después y de todo ese dolor surgiría esta obra inmortal llamada \"Frankenstein, o el moderno Prometeo\"que Mary Shelley escribiría con tan sólo dieciocho años.\"Pero esto no es todo. Existe un dato que no muchos conocen acerca de Mary Shelley: cuando el cuerpo de Percy Bysshe Shelley es llevado ante ella, pide que le saquen el corazón, dado que cuando Shelley es cremado su corazón, por razones completamente inexplicables, ¡no se quemó!Ante esta señal, ella pidió que lo envolvieran en hojas de sus propios poemas, lo pusieran en un estuche y lo colocaran en su ataúd cuando ella misma falleciera y de esta manera, cuando esto sucedió, la enterraron junto con el corazón de su amado.Más Romanticismo que eso,imposible.Poco queda por agregar acerca de Frankenstein que no se haya escrito ya a estas alturas.La novela es y será una de las más representativas del Romanticismo. Contiene muchos elementos de este movimiento: desde la dualidad Víctor/Monstruo, que en cierta manera es una forma de temática del doble, el sufrimiento del que sabe que va a perder (en ambos casos), el titanismo romántico claramente expuesto en la obra, el juego peligroso con la ciencia (El extraño Caso del Dr. Jekyll y Mr. Hyde de Robert Louis Stevenson es otro caso y posteriormente lo será también \"La isla del doctor Moreau\" de H.G. Wells ) y la referencia de Prometeo (de allí el subtítulo de la misma), ese semi dios condenado al que hace referencia, inmortalizarán esta obra.La obra posee tres narradores bien diferenciados. En primer lugar leemos las cartas del capitán Walton quien nos presenta la historia de cómo encuentra al doctor Víctor Frankenstein en medio del lugar más congelado del Polo Norte.Posteriormente, todos los sucesos que Frankenstein le cuenta a Walton, desde cómo es su niñez hasta la creación del horrendo monstruo y lo que sucede después ante la negativa suya de crearle una compañera y por último es el turno de la criatura quien le cuenta a Frankenstein todas las vicisitudes que tuvo que pasar hasta que encuentra nuevamente a su creador.Cuando uno cree que es terrible lo que lee acerca de lo que sufre Víctor Frankenstein, se queda sin palabras al enterarse de las miserias e injusticias que la criatura debe sobrellevar para no sucumbir.Es extremadamente bella y a la vez terrible la manera en que la autora nos acerca ambas historias, ya que logra conmovernos en ambos casos, a punto tal que no sabemos cómo lectores a quién apoyar.El encuentro entre ambos y lo que surge de ello es épico y no existe otro adjetivo para describir tanta perfección.Los diálogos son poderosos, las escenas subyugantes y el argumento está construido sin fallas para todo se vaya ensamblando con el correr de la lectura.La novela es cerrada magistralmente cuando los tres, Walton, Frankenstein y la criatura se encuentran y le ponen fin a este drama tan intenso, tan único, tan descollante.Es algo verdaderamente espeluznante tratar de entender cómo pudo Mary Shelley, esta adolescente de dieciocho años en el siglo XIX, crear algo tan inolvidable y terrible.Más de un estudioso de las letras se lo sigue preguntando."

        "user_review": "So my first \"non-school related\" experience with Homer's classic tale, and my most powerful impression, beyond the overall splendor of the story, was...HOLY SHIT SNACKSthese Greeks were a violent bunch. Case in point:...they hauled him out through the doorway into the court,lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife,tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat rawand in manic fury hacked off hands and feet.then once they'd washed their own hands and feetthey went inside again to join odysseus.their work was done here now.\"Their work was done here now.\" What a great line.Want more violence you say? How about slaughtering over 100 house guests for over-indulging in your hospitality? Can you say overkill!! And for the true splatter junkies out there, you can add in some casual rapes, widespread maiming, a score of people-squishing, crew members being chewed and swallowed, healthy doses of mutilation and torture, and one cyclops blinding. That should make even the most discriminating gore hound leg-humping happy. Yes...that's me...guilty.However, beyond the cockle-warming violence and mayhem, this is a rocking good story that I enjoyed (as in \"smile on my face thinking this is genuinely cool\") much more than I expected to going into it. There is nothing dry or plodding about the story. Beautifully written, and encompassing themes of love, loyalty and heroism while commenting on many facets of the human condition. As important as this story is to literature, it is above all else...ENTERTAINING. In fact, without its massive entertainment factor, I'm pretty sure it's overall importance among the classics would be significantly reduced. Thankfully, there is no risk of that.A NOTE ON THE TEXTBefore I continue, I want to comment on the version I read/listened to because I think can be critical to people's reaction to the story. There are a TRUCKLOAD of Odyssey translations out there and, from what I've seen, they range wider in quality and faithfulness to the original text than those of almost any other work of Western Literature. These versions can differ so much that I believe two people with identical reading tastes could each read a different translation and walk away with vastly different opinions on the work.The version I am reviewing (and from which the above quote is derived) is theRobert Faglestranslation which uses contemporary prose and structure while remaining faithful to the content of the original. I found it a terrific place for a \"first experience\" with this work because of how easy to follow it was. Plus, I listened to the audio version read bySir Ian McKellenwhich was an amazing experience and one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.In addition to the Fagles version, I also own theAlexander Popetranslation as part of my Easton Press collection ofThe 100 Greatest Books Ever Written. While listening to the Fagles version, I would often follow along with the Pope translation and let me tell you....they are vastly different. While the overall story is the same, the presentation, prose and the structure are nothing alike. As an example, here is the same passage I quoted earlier from the Pope translation.Then forth they led [______], and beganTheir bloody work; they lopp'd away the man,Morsel for dogs! then trimm'd with brazen shearsThe wretch, and shorten'd of his nose and ears;His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel;He roar'd, and torments gave his soul to hell.They wash, and to Ulysses take their way:So ends the bloody business of the day.Very different treatments of the same scene. In my opinion, the Pope language is more beautiful and far more poetic and lyrical than the Fagles translation. However, I am glad I started with the Fagles version because it provided me with a much better comprehension of the story itself. No head-scratching moments. Now that I have a firm grounding in the story, I plan to go back at some point and read the Pope version so that I can absorb the greater beauty of that translation.In a nutshell, I'm saying that you should make sure you find a translation that works for you. That's my two or three cents.THE STORYSo Odysseus, master strategist and tactician (not to mention schemer, manipulator and liar extraordinaire), travels home to Ithaca after the Trojan War. Delays and detours ensue which take up the first half of the story. Most of these travel snags are caused by Poseidon, who is grudging on Odysseus for stick-poking Poseidon's son (i.e. the Cyclops) in the peeper. Not to fear, Athena (goddess of guile and craftiness) is a proud sponsor of Odysseus and, along with some help for big daddy god Zeus, throws Odysseus some Olympian help.Odysseus' travels are full of great summer blockbuster-like entertainment and at the same time explore all manner of Greek daily life as well as touching on many of their beliefs and traditions. It really is a perfect blend of fun and brain food. From his time on the island homes of the goddesses Calypso and Circe (who he gets busy with despite his \"undying\" love for his wife, Penelope...men huh?), to his run ins with the giant Laestrygonians and the Lotus-eaters (i.e., thugs and drugs) and his fateful encounter with the Cyclops, Polyphemus. Odysseus even takes a jaunt to the underworld where he speaks to Achilles and gets to listen to dead king Agamemnon go on an anti-marriage rant because his conniving wife poisoned him to death. Homer does a superb job of keeping the story epic while providing the reader with wonderful details about the life of the greek people during this period.The man had story-telling chops..Meanwhile, while Odysseus is engaged in the ancient greek version of theAmazing Race, back on Ithaca we've got a full-fledged version of theBachelorettegoing on as over a hundred suitors are camped out at Odysseus pad trying to get Penelope to give them a rose. This has Odysseus' son, Telemachus, on the rage because the suitors are eating, drinking and servant-boinking him out of his entire inheritance while they wait on Penelope. You might think that Telemachus could just kick the freeloaders out, but the law of \"hospitality\" was huge for the Greeks and the suitor-douches use it to full advantage.Well Odysseus eventually makes it back to Ithaca, alone and in disguise, after all of this crew have been eaten, squashed, drowned or otherwise rendered life-impaired. Not an easy place to live is ancient Greece. Odysseus proceeds to work a web of deceit and revenge against the suitors that is a wonder to behold. I'll leave the final climax to you, but I will say that there was no free lunch in Homer's time and the checks that people wrote with their bad behavior are paid in full.MY THOUGHTSThis was a fun, fun, fun read. I want to start with that because this is not one of those classics that I think is worth while only to get it under your belt or checked off a list. This was a great story with great characters and in a style that was both \"off the usual path\" but still easy to follow.Going back to my comments on the various versions of the story, I think this may end up being a five star read in one of the more flowery, densely poetic translations where the emotion and passion is just a bit more in your face. I am still thrilled to have listened to the version I did (especially as read by Gandalf) because I now have a firm foundation in the story and can afford to be a bit more adventurous with my next version.The tone of the story is heroic and yet very dark. The gods are capricious and temperamental and cause a whole lot of death and devastation for nothing more than a bruised ego or even a whim. The pace of the story is fast and moves quickly with hardly a chance to even catch your breath.It is a big epic story...it is THE BIG EPIC STORY...and its reputation is well deserved. A terrific read as well as one of the most important works in the Western canon. Definitely worth your time.4.5 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"

        "user_review": "I first read Homer in the 19th-century French translation byLeconte de Lisle— the equivalent, say, of the 18th-century translation into English byAlexander Pope: a pompous, archaic and exhausting bore of a book. I kept my chin up and, after a while, tried another inflated Frenchman: the 1955 translation by the curly-moustachedVictor Bérard(in the prestigious Pléiade edition, with an odd arrangement of chapters). A bit less depraved than the Parnassian poet, but all in all (alack!) not much better. Only last year came this new English translation by Emily Wilson, an American academic and allegedly the first woman to translate Homer into English. And it is a damned refreshing take on Homer! Basically, it's the first time I'm readingThe Odysseywithout dozing off on every other page.Yet, Wilson laid down a daunting challenge to herself: to keep the same number of verses as in Homer's epic and transpose the Greek's dactylic hexameters into the traditional (Shakespearian) iambic pentameter. An amazing feat indeed, and she pulled it off with ease, concealing, like an expert weaver, the technicalities of her achievement and dodging some of the ponderousness of the Homeric text (not least of which: the grinding epithets attached to each character or some awkward similes that pop up from time to time): the result is an unaffected, luminous poem, sometimes energetic, sometimes delicate, that flows effortlessly, focusing our attention not on some turgid, embalming, purple prose, but on what is actually at stake in the story, and on the beat of the tale.A few things become glaringly apparent thanks to this new translation: Odysseus is not quite the wise and glorious war hero that we might think. As Wilson states in her opening verse, he is \"a complicated man\" (πολuτροπον), who messes around with everyone he encounters and talks rubbish on every occasion; in short: he is an inveterate liar. So much so that, in the end, he could easily qualify as the first case of \"unreliable narrator\". Most notably, when he is invited to the court of Alcinous and tells the story of his misadventures after the Trojan War — the famous embedded and somewhat fantastical tale (books 9-12) of the Cicones, Lotus-Eaters, Cyclopes, Aeolus, Laestrygonians, Circe, Helios, the dead, the Sirens, Charybdis and Scylla and Calypso —, we cannot help but wonder to what extent Odysseus is making up all this, to entertain his generous hosts. Later on, Odysseus will tell a completely different account of his adventures to other people, or a strongly expurgated version of the first tale to his own wife, misrepresenting himself to her. In short, he is indeed a consummated storyteller — a shining mask for the rhapsodist himself?IfThe Iliadis the grandfather of pretty much all literature, thenThe Odysseyis the grandmother: Aeneas, Sindbad, Gulliver, Robinson, Pym, Ahab, Nemo, Marlow are all descendants of Odysseus; Hamlet is a sort of echo of Telemachus; Excalibur is an ersatz of Odysseus' mighty bow; James Joyce's Dublin is a Homeric town. We might wonder, however, why Odysseus' adventures have become such a significant source of inspiration for writers and scholars who claim to be feminists, like Emily Wilson, of course, but also recently Madeline Miller, with her best-sellerCirce, and a few years ago, Margaret Atwood and herPenelopiad.Clearly, most characters inThe Odysseyexpress a form of mistrust towards the opposite sex: men believe women to be either nosy sluts or demi-hags; women would rather turn men into pigs or captives than actually deal with them. Even the fair queen Penelope — the only character on the level and the antithesis of the treacherous and fiendish Clytemnestra — is actually just as deceptive, weaving and unweaving her crewelwork to avoid standing up to the wolfish suitors. That being said, let's save the old nanny Eurycleia, if you insist... But, after all, isn't this gender suspiciousness at the heart of feminism? It is notable, by the way, that although Odysseus looks like the paragon of manliness and a confirmed skirt-chaser (Penelope, Circe, Calypso, Nausicaa), the fact of the matter is that he is either the punchbag of Poseidon (a male god) or a puppet in the hands of the goddess Athena (a female), who transforms him at will, stultifies his enemies and makes him the pin-up of every girl he encounters. I will confess: in this old tale, men are, at best, a bit ridiculous and irritating — if not \"complicated\".To top it all off, the Odyssey is, at its heart, a tale of extreme violence. I'm not just thinking of the savagery of Polyphemus, the Laestrygonians or Scylla, all blood-thirsty monsters who decimate Odysseus' crewmen. I'm thinking of Odysseus himself, probably the most blood-thirsty character in the whole poem. In fact, instead of coming back home as the one true king of Ithaca and properly claim back his throne and wife in a straightforward manner, he chooses (or instead follows Athena's plan) to approach the suitors under the guise of a despicable old beggar, puts the devil in them — curses, insults and stools fly back and forth across the saloon on every page — and, when the time is ripe, gets into a shooting spree, slaughters the suitors pitilessly one by one (they are a bunch of more than a hundred dudes!), and tortures atrociously whoever, herdsmen or slave girls alike, got mixed up with them.The Odysseyends with a big spring cleaning in a merry bath of haemoglobin... Which begs a nagging question: seeing how he behaves, might Odysseus himself not have killed his crew at sea (perhaps to gobble them up, since he is such a gourmand of meatballs and shish kebabs?), and later on told all sorts of baloney about cyclops and shipwrecks to justify his situation?... Anyway, had Homer been working in Hollywood instead of Ancient Greece, he would indeed be on the same side as Peckinpah, Coppola, Scorsese and Tarantino!And now, let's wait for Emily Wilson to work her magic onThe Iliad…"

        "user_review": "When you stop and think about it, much of classic literature is about how getting on a boat is a bad idea. This book is a litany on why boating is a bad idea. You can say it at least worked out for Odysseus but did it? Did itreally? If that dude isn't haunted by the screams of his crew forever it's just because the horrors of having been on a boat are overriding it. The whole war could have been avoided if Helen had just stayed off one boat. So if you ever find yourself as a character in a novel (you'll know by the sweet smell of freshly printed pages on the breeze) I beg you DO NOT GET ON A BOAT. You won't get that 'one fine day…' on a boat Gatsby is hoping for in the famous line about the futility of boats (among other things). Look at Moby Dick—bet the crew of the Pequad were all wishing they stayed on land right before the whale drowned all their asses. You know what isn't trying to drown you? Land. Ahab might have been a cool baker or candlestick maker but boats led him astray.The danger of literary boats is real, my friends, Poe's only novel was about just that. Heart of Darkness? More like Boats are the Heart of the Problem. Look what happened to that old man in the sea, almost starved! 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was like but what if we go UNDER the water surely that'll work out great? Wrong. Jim Hawkins and Robinson Curuso could have avoided all sorts of trouble if they stayed off boats. And watch out for Theseus' ship, we don't know if it even counts as the same ship! Boats are tricky like that. Ask the orcas, they know what's up.Now in sci fi, spaceships are basically just space boats. And look what happened to Paul Atreides when he took that space boat to Arrakis: literally fucking space genocide. Nobody wants that. Hell, the Death Star is just a really really big genocide boat and that ended poorly for everyone. 2001 A Space Odyssey has a space boat out for murder and blaming the crew.So watch out for boats, ye land lubbers. Leave the pirating to me."

Or was it already based on the literary tradition? Whatever the answer is the number of allusions toThe Odysseyin the world literature is impossible to count.All starts here.In this almost lifelong homecoming across seas, islands, dreams, visions and even the land of the dead there are no stops.You will want no guide, raise your mast, set your white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two roaring rivers run into one another.\"When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place water – sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.\"And all ends here.It's a circle…\"As the end approaches, there are no longer any images from memory – there are only words.

        "user_review": "I have read The Odyssey three times. The first was not really a read but more of a listen in the true oral tradition. During embroidery class one of us, young girls on the verge of entering the teens, would read a passage while the rest were all busy with our eyes and fingers, our needles and threads. All learning to be future Penelopes: crafty with their crafts, cultivated, patient and loyal. And all wives.The second read was already as an adult. That time I let myself be led by the adventures and imagination of the 'resourceful' one. Relishing on the literary rhythm of the hexameters I particularly enjoyed the epithets used by the bards to keep the attention of the listeners...Dawn of the rosy fingerswas my favourite. By then my embroideries were far away from my mind.This third time I read it in preparation for tackling Joyce's take on Homer. And this time, with a more detached stance, I have been surprised by the structure of the work, the handling of time, and the role of narration. And those aspects I take with me in this third reading.Of the twenty-four books, the first four orTelemachiad, are preliminary. Acting as an overture they take place not too long before the main action. The following four are another preamble, which take place roughly at the same time as the previous four. The son and the father are getting ready to meet almost at the end of twenty years of their separation with ten at the war and ten coming back.Then, and this was my surprise, what I always thought of as the core of the Odyssey: the magical adventures with the Cyclops and Polyphemus, the Lotus Eaters, the Sirens, Circe and the trip to the Underworld, the Laestrygonias, Scylla and Charybdis, the Sun God etc, forming what is called theApologoi, are a very small part of the book. All of these eventful episodes take place along three years before the seven that Odysseus is amorously trapped by Kalypso. And these are narrated, after the fact, by Odysseus himself in just four more chapters (chapters nine to twelve). So, to what in my mind was the meat of the Odyssey is only 17% of the book. And if one recalls what a great deceiver Odysseus can be, one could always wonder at these fables.The rest, the remaining twelve chapters, or half of the book, is the actual Homecoming.What I have realized now is that The Odyssey is really about this Homecoming. And that is what we witness directly. All the enchanted adventures are told tales. Odysseus as the bard chanting his own stories in the court of the Phaeacians. A supreme teller since through his fables he has to build the image of the hero that his, possibly dangerous, audience see and do not see. Odysseus as myth and myth-maker. No wonder his epithet of 'the resourceful one'.If the Homecoming had previously stayed in my mind as just an expected end, in which all the invective and riveting elements are drearily put at an end, as if one could already close the door and leave, the one I have read now surprised me by its dramatization. A different craft is at stage.The bard enacts the process of Justice performing through an act of Revenge. There is no layered telling of the tale. In the last half of the poem the pace and complexity of the various elements as they converge in the palace to play out divine retribution--in which success does not seem assured, not even to the great Odysseus who knows he has Athena's support--, has seemed, this third time round, magisterial.And it is Penelope the patient, the apprehensive, the one who for twenty years has protected her mistrust with her weaving, the one who, with her threads, offers the needed opportunity that the resourceful hero is at pains to find. When she announces that she is about to end to the tapestry that has become her life, the beggar can then put also an end to the agony.Crafted Homecoming."

        "user_review": "Ever since I first read Homer's epic describing the adventures of Odysseus back in my school days, three of those adventures fired my imagination: The Lotus Eaters, The Cyclops and the Sirens, most especially the Sirens. I just did revisit these sections of this Greek epic and my imagination was set aflame yet again. How much, you ask? Here is my microfiction as a tribute to the great poet:THE SIRENSThis happened back in those days when I was a member of an experimental performing-arts troupe down in Greenwich Village. We would read poetry, dance and act out avant-garde plays in our dilapidated little theater. For a modest charge people could come in and watch for as long as they wanted.Somehow, a business executive who worked downtown in the financial district heard of what we were doing and spoke with our director about an act he has all worked out but needed a supporting cast and that he would pay handsomely if we went along with him.Well, experimental is experimental and if we were going to be well paid we had nothing to lose. The first thing he did was pass out our costumes. In addition to himself, he had parts for three men and three women. The play we were to perform was so simple we didn't even need a written script. He was to be Odysseus from Homer's epic and three men would be his sailors. As for the women, we would be the singing Sirens.So, after he changed – quite a sight in a loincloth, being gray-haired, jowly, pasty-skinned and potbellied – we went on stage and he told the sailors how no man has ever heard the hypnotic songs of the Sirens and lived to tell the tale but he, mighty Odysseus, would be the first. He instructed the sailors to tie him to the ship's mast. They used one of the building's pillars and when he cried out as the Sirens sang their song the sailors, who had wax in their ears, were to bind him to the mast even tighter.Meanwhile, three of us ladies were on stage as the Sirens, in costume, bare-breasted and outfitted with wings. We began singing a sweet, lilting melody. Mike – that was the businessman's name – started screaming and the sailors tightened the ropes that bound him. The sailors were glad their ears were plugged as Mike screamed for nearly half an hour.When the ship passed out of earshot of the Sirens, the sailors unbound mighty Odysseus and he collapsed on our makeshift stage, a mass of exhausted middle-aged flesh. The audience applauded, even cheered and we continued our performance of Odysseus and the Sirens every night for more than a week. Then one night Mike outdid himself. His blue eyes bulged, the veins in his neck popped and his face turned a deeper blood-scarlet than ever before. And what I feared might happen, did happen – Mike had a heart attack. We had to interrupt our performance and call an ambulance.We all thought that was the end of our dealing with Mike aka Odysseus until our director received a call from the hospital. Mike told her he was going to be just fine and would be back on stage next week. We called a meeting and everyone agreed that we would suggest Mike seek psychiatric help but if he insists on playing Odysseus, he will have to take his act elsewhere."

        "user_review": "\"I'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman!\"—Homer(Simpson)Following James Joyce's lead, I used Homer's heroic story as inspiration for a novel-in-progress.But how can I, a mere mortal, do justice tothemost famous epic poem ever written? An encounter with a work of this magnitude should be shared, rather than reviewed.Homer is the great, great, great (recurring) grand-daddy of modern literature and this colossus is as immortal as the gods within it.And what a tale this must have been way back in the 8th century BC. Then, it was sung, rather than read, and I guess the first to bear witness must have been jigging about in their togas with unbridled excitement.Alas, I didn't read it in ancient Greek, as Homer had intended. My copy was transcribed to a Kindle, rather than papyri, and translated by none other than the genius that was Alexander Pope (yep, I went old school on this).Odysseus, he of the title, otherwise known in Latin as Ulysses, embarks on a perilous, stop/start, um,odyssey, attempting to get home to Ithaca after fighting in the Trojan War for a decade.Such an amazing story, overflowing with an abundance of adventure. Poor Odysseus, having battled treacherous seas, wrathful gods, enchanting sirens and a Cyclops, then has to put up with big bad Poseidon weighing in with some nautical muscle and shipwrecking his boat!Plagued by setback after setback, the journey home takes TEN gruelling years to complete! And, as if that wasn't bad enough, wife Penelope has meanwhile given up hope of him returning home alive and is being courted by one hundred suitors, none of whom are fit to kiss our hero's sandals.This is by no means a page-turner and some background knowledge is required to appreciate the finer points. Pope has done an amazing job to remain somewhat sympathetic to the timbre of Homer's lyrical story, and his rhyming couplets are a thing to behold:\"But when the star of eve with golden lightAdorn'd the matron brow of night.\"Beautiful!Homer (the poet, not the cartoon character) has fuelled the imagination of countless authors throughout the centuries, and therefore it would be sacrilege for me to award anything less than five heroic stars."

This exciting new translation will surprise you, and send you to compare certain passages with earlier translations. In herIntroduction, Wilson raises that issue of translation herself: How is it possible to have so many different translations, all of which could be considered \"correct\"?Wilson reminds us what a ripping good yarn this story is, and removes any barriers to understanding. We can come to it with our current sensibility and find in it all kinds of foretelling and parallels with life today, and perhaps we even see the genesis of our own core morality, a morality that feels inexplicably learned. Perhaps the passed-down sense of right and wrong, of fairness and justice we read of here was learned through these early stories and lessons from the gods. Or are we interpreting the story to fit our sensibility?These delicious questions operate in deep consciousness while we pleasure in learning more about that liar Odysseus, described again and again as wily, scheming, cunning, \"his lies were like truth.\" He learned how to bend the truth at his grandfather's knee, and the gods exploited that talent when they helped him out. The skill served him well, allowing him to confuse and evade captors throughout his ordeal, as well as keep his wife and father in the dark about his identity upon his return until he could reveal the truth at a time of maximum impact.There does inevitably come a time when people react cautiously to what is told them, even to the evidence their own eyes. The gods can cloud one's understanding, it is well known, and truth is suspected in every encounter. These words Penelope speaks:\"Please forgive me, do not keepbearing a grudge because when I first saw you,I would not welcome you immediately.I felt a constant dread that some bad manwould fool me with his lies. There are so manydishonest, clever men...\"Particularly easy to relate to today are descriptions of Penelope's ungrateful suitors like Ctesippius, who \"encouraged by extraordinary wealth, had come to court Odysseus' wife.\" Also speaking insight for us today are the phrases \"Weapons themselves can tempt a man to fight\" and \"Arms themselves can prompt a man to use them.\"There is a conflicted view of women in this story: \"Sex sways all women's minds, even the best of them,\" though Penelope is a paragon of virtue, managing to avoid temptation through her own duplicitousness. She hardly seems a victim at all in this reading, merely an unwilling captor. She is strong, smart, loyal, generous, and brave, all the qualities any man would want for his wife.We understand the slave girls that Odysseus felt he had to \"test\" for loyalty were at the disposal of the ungrateful suitors who, after they ate and drank at Penelope's expense, often met the house girls after hours. Some of the girls appeared to go willingly, laughing and teasing as they went, and were outspoken about their support of the men they'd taken up with. Others, we get the impression from the text, felt they had no choice.Race is not mentioned but once in this book, very matter-of-factly, though the darker man is a servant to the lighter one:\"…[Odysseus] had a valet with him,I do remember, named Eurybates,a man a little older than himself,who had black skin, round shoulders, woolly hair,and was [Odysseus's] favorite our of all his crewbecause his mind matched his.\"Odysseus's tribulations are terrible, but appear to be brought on by his own stubborn and petulant nature, like his taunting of the blinded Cyclops from his own escaping ship. Cyclops was Poseidon's son so Odysseus's behavior was especially unwise, particularly since his own men were yelling at him to stop. Later, that betrayal of the men's best interests for his own childish purpose will come back to haunt Odysseus when the men suspect him of thinking only of himself--greediness--and unleash terrible winds by accident, blowing them tragically off course in rugged seas.We watch, fascinated, as the gods seriously mess Odysseus about, and then come to his aid. We really get the sense of the gods playing, as in Athena's willingness to give Odysseus strength and arms when fighting the suitors in his house, but being unwilling to actually step in to help with the fighting. Instead, she watched from the rafters. It's hard not to be just a little resentful.Wilson's translation reads very fast and very clearly. There always seemed to be some ramp-up time reading Greek myths in the past, but now the adventures appear perfectly accessible. Granted, there are some names you'll have to figure out, but that's part of being \"constructively lost,\" as Pynchon says.Abook-by-book readingof this new translation will begin March 1st on the Goodreads website, hosted by Kris Rabberman, Wilson's colleague at the University of Pennsylvania. To prepare for the first online discussion later this week, Kris has suggested participants read theIntroduction. If interested readers are still not entirely convinced they want this literary experience now, someexcerpts have been reprinted inThe Paris Review."

We know the story of Ulysses; we have read a few episodes and seen a film but read the whole work, with these long chapters, the Homeric epithets, and the lengthy descriptions of the marine world with its monsters and demons. One has the impression of attending a closed session on the sea. Yet, Ulysses only berths to better take to the sea as if the mainland was forbidden to him and harmful, as if his condemnation to wandering on the sea was more beneficial on the water than on land. And then there are the episodes worthy of an adventure novel, the Sirens, symbols of literary song, the author's voice who takes us where we want and can destroy us (hey, Bovary), and monsters like Charybdis and Sylla.Finally, this is surprising; we talk more about the others, Telemachus, her son looking for him, and Penelope waiting for her than about him, who wants to return. The novel has almost everything: the search for the other, the quest, the song of words, and the pleasure of returning home. It is as enjoyable to study and understand, so full of symbols, as reading."

        "user_review": "It's impossible not to smile when you start reading such a classic and, after only the first few pages, you realize and completely understand why it's regarded as one of the most important works in literature. I'm always a little anxious when I tackle such important and renowned books for being afraid of not comprehending or loving them -War and PeaceandDon Quixote, for example - as they seem to deserve. Not that I'm obligated to like them, but I always feel such buzz comes for a reason and I try to at least find out why. WithThe Odyssey, once again, I find that the ones who have read it before me were right: it's amazing.I didn't have plans to readThe Odysseyany time soon - I've never devoted much time to epic poems and this one has more than 12,000 verses -, but because I've been eyingUlysseson my shelves for quite some time, I decided to prepare myself for it and read about Odysseus with a great group here on Goodreads. To call Homer's book simply \"a preparation\" for Joyce's work is now not only unfair, but also absurd to me. However, I'm glad that I finally read it, whatever the reason behind it was.The Odysseytells the story of Odysseus's (Ulysses) journey back to his home Ithaca to return to his wife Penelope and son Telemachus after twenty years of absence. Our hero left his home to fight in the Trojan War - that alone lasted ten years - and encountered too many obstacles that kept him away for another ten years. Back in Ithaca, people had already lost hope that he could still be alive and his wife was being courted by suitors who wanted to marry her.Alongside the emotional and heartfelt story, what grabbed my attention here was the poem's style and structure. For a work that's believed to have been written in the 8th century BC, its quality and refinement certainly amazed me. Some of the story is told through flashbacks, some of it is told through different narrators and its narratives are non-linear, so I was positively surprised.I could try to write an analysis about the recurring themes on the book - vengeance, spiritual growth, hospitality - or try to decipher its symbolism - much has been written about Odysseus's bow, Laertes's shroud, the sea -, but I feel I would fail and wouldn't be able to do it in a deep level, especially after having read the great introduction and notes written by Bernard Knox.What kept me away from Homer's work was the fear that it would be too dense and heavy on mythology - it is mythological, of course -, making it hard for me to understand it. Although labored, the narrative is quite simple and easy to follow. Knox's notes were a great companion to fill in the details I needed to comprehend the book in a deeper level.Rating: it's my belief that a great book not only satisfy your expectations, but also inspire you to delve further into its writer's other works, similar subjects or even other books from the same time period.The Odysseyraised my interest about Greek mythology andThe Iliad, so I guess it served its purpose with high colors. Because of that, 5 glowing and beautiful stars."

        "user_review": "I don't think the world (or the Goodreads user base) will gain much by my \"reviewing\"The Odyssey. Everything that needs to be said about this wonderful epic has been said throughout the ages—and that again and again—by people who were and are much more capable than me.All there's left for me to say is that I LOVED it, and I didn't expect to.The Odysseywas a much quicker, more thrilling and fun read than I could've ever imagined. With his translation, Fagles ignited my love for Ancient texts, and also removed all the fears I had surrounding these types of lectures. They aren't as scary or hard to understand as I thought. They're actually quite fun... and bloody, and prepostorous, and heart-warming, and and and ...So instead of rambling about the love I have for Penelope, or my bewildered admiration for Helen, my love-hate relationship to Odysseus and his son Telemachus, and the wrath I feel for the Gods, I will share with you10 tips on how to tackle this tome:#1 Read the Verse version, not the Prose onesThe Odysseyhas been written and conceived in verse. However, through the ages, and for better accessibility for a possible readership, some translator have translated this epic into prose. Personally, I haven't heard many great things about the Prose translation and since I read a Verse translation myself (and loved it), I would always advise to go with a Verse version ofThe Odyssey.It flows much more nicely and makes more sense, as verse is more capable and fitting to convey how the characters speak and interact with each other. The importance of the orality of this text is also made apparent in various different moments in the text, it begins with the evocation of the Muse who is told to sing about the \"Man of twists and turns\", and ends with Odysseus telling his story to the Phaeacians, possibly becoming an unreliable narrator of his own adventures and achievements himself. This text istoldwithin multiple layers, the person who speaks/narrates is essential to the message that is conveyed within the text, and the verse versions are able to capture these layers brilliantly.#2 Find the right translatorThe Odysseyis literally a tale as old as time (or as old as the Western canon goes back to) and so there are dozens of translations to choose from. Since I've only read the Fagles translation from the mid-90s, I can only judge that one, but Fagles is definitely a translation I'd recommend. It's straight to the point, quite modern in tone (and therefore easily to understand) and not at all flowery or \"lyrical\". Other renown translators are Lattimore, Pope (even though that's an OOOOLD one), Graves and Fitzgerald. Emily Wilson is the first woman to translate the epic into English and her new translation (it's from 2018, I think?) has a feminist twist, so that might be up your alley.#3 Manage your expectationsI don't know about you but I had many misconceptions about this tale. I really thought Odysseus was at sea for 20 years, unable to find his way home. I thoughtThe Odysseywould narrate all his adventures at sea, like battling the cyclops, stealing the cattle of the Sun or landing on Circe's island. I couldn't have been more wrong. What I just described are only four out of twenty-four books of this epic. Odysseus' adventures at sea only take up a sixth of the story. We only meet the man by Book 5, before the first four books (also known as the Telemachia) focus solely on his son and his trial of setting out to visit Nestor and Menelaus to get to know the whereabouts of his father. And then when we finally meet Odysseus, he is actually back in Ithaca by the halfway point of this book. So Book 13-24 are actually setinIthaca, and it's not about sea adventures at all, it's about bloody revenge, my dudes.Since Penelope (and Telemachus) have been harassed ever since Odysseus failed to return from the Trojan War, Odysseus now takes it upon himself, upon his return, to slaughter all the suitors (all 100+ of them) who harassed his wife, ate his food, slaughtered his animals and wracked havoc on his kingdom. And baby, that revenge is drawn out and sweet. Book 22 (the slaughter of the suitors) is as bloody as it is brilliant, definitely my favorite of the 24 books!#4 Read it quicklyThe Odysseyis a big book but I would recommend reading as much as you can, but a minimum of one book a day. The pacing of this epic is amazing and very intricate, and when readingThe Odysseycontinuously, it will hit you right in the feels. You will want Penelope and Odysseus to reunite ALREADY but Homer will keep you waiting book for book, and delay their reunion to no end until it ends in a big crescendo and huge offense, and you will be clutching your pearls.#5 Do your researchThe Odysseyis easy to understand (at least for how old and huge in scope it is), however, I'd still recommend doing secondary research. Either get a book with a good introduction, notes and chronology (like the Penguin Deluxe Classics version I own) or try to find other sources online.#6 Listen to podcastsWhat helped me the most was listening to the Close Reads podcast. They did many different episodes discussing 2-4 books per episode, diving deep into analysis and questions. Many other readers also enjoyed the Literature and History podcast. These are 3 episodes, each focusing on 8 books, which function more like a summary and overview of key events and questions.#7 Watch YouTube videosOn YouTube, I'd recommend watching the Ted-Ed or CrashCourse videos for a nice appetizer, and then also Moan Inc.'s 24-video series, where she dives deep into this epic, summarizes and analyses! It's a fantastic resource!#8 Focus on what's most interesting to youOn your first read, you won't be able to get it all. And that's okay. Try to find out what's most appealing and interesting to you. Is it how Homer developed his characters and how they interact with each other? Is it the Greek mythology? Or is it Homer himself? The man, the mystery? Was he one person, was he blind, was he actually able to write? There are many different questions surrounding this epic. Find and focus on what's most important to you.#9 Find modern influencesThe Odysseyhas influenced many artists throughout the centuries. When reading pay attention to which associations you make, which references suddenly make sense, where have you seen a similar writing style, set-up etc. in modern texts? When I readThe OdysseyI couldn't shake the feeling that Patrick Rothfuss was deeply influenced by Odysseus as a characterandunreliable narrator in his development of Kvothe, the hero of Rothfuss'The Kingkiller Chronicles. Just like Odysseus, Kvothe tells his own story to people who are eagerly listening. What lies is he making up to make himself look better? How is he distorting reality?The slaughter of the suitors in Book 22, reminded me of Shakespeare'sTitus Andronicuswhich is equally bloody and George R.R. Martin's Red Wedding... the list goes on and on.#10 Don't let a modern judgment cloud your visionThere are many things inThe Odysseythat happen which from a modern viewpoint are absolutely despicable. There's slavery, rape, murder etc. Women usually get the short end of the stick, and Odysseus is hailed for everything he does, even if it is ordering the hanging of the maids who were raped by the suitors because they are no longer \"pure\". As a modern reader, some of the prescribed events can be hard to stomach. However, I fared best with meeting the book where it's at – which means that I can still have my own reservations and judge some of the characters (especially Odysseus) rather harshly, but also keep Homer's values and the values of his time in mind. So therefore I don't have to see Odysseus as a \"hero\", but I will also not be pissed or confused why Homer portrayed it him as one. It makes perfect sense keeping the context in which the poem was written in in mind."

Sentir, que es un soplo la vida, que veinte años no es nada, que febril la mirada, errante en las sombras, te busca y te nombra. Vivir, con el alma aferrada, a un dulce recuerdo que lloro otra vez.\"Concuerdo totalmente con el periodista y traductor Joan Casas, cuando en el prólogo de esta edición nos dice que si se hubieran reunido temas y canciones para una banda de sonido de este libro, hubiera sido su tema principal \"Volver\", ese inmortal tango de Gardel y Le Pera, que es el más odiseico de todos los tiempos, puesto que esas sentidas estrofas concuerdan con la historia de este héroe, Laertíada, raza de Zeus, agudisimo Ulises, aunque para mí con una salvedad: jamás Ulises vuelve con la frente marchita sino con ésta bien alta, más allá de los padeceres, deshonras y pérdidas que sufre en su periplo de retorno durante diez años, luego de otros diez luchando en Troya cuando finalmente pisa su amadísima Ítaca.Siempre consideré que para leer la Odisea me era indispensable primero terminar la Ilíada aunque en realidad lo correcto sería primero leer la Teogonía de Hesíodo, en donde el aedo cuenta el origen del mundo hasta la aparición de todos los dioses del Olimpo que luego Homero y el resto de los poetas griegos más importantes tomarán como parte de sus relatos épicos y tragedias.Luego viene la batalla de Troya tal como nos lo es contada en la Ilíada, y posteriormente, los libros que narran los retornos por un lado, de Ulises en la Odisea, el de Eneas en la Eneída luego de la destrucción de Troya (esto narrado por el poeta latino Virgilio pero que tiene directa conexión con los otros poemas épicos), junto con el regreso de Agamenón a su casa, narrado por Esquilo, con un resultado completamente opuesto al de Ulises, puesto que a diferencia de Penélope, es asesinado por su esposa Clitmnenestra y Egisto, su amante y posteriormente la Orestíada, también de Esquilo, que cuenta la venganza de Orestes, hijo de Agamenón, matando al asesino de su padre.Lamentablemente yo no mantuve ese orden de lectura. Leí primero la Eneida, luego la Ilíada y Odisea y ahora comencé con la Teogonía.Pero volvamos a esta maravilla de libro. Realmente he disfrutado de la misma manera que en la Ilíada lo que Homero nos cuenta en la Odisea con la diferencia que en este libro me ha sido aún más placentera su lectura, dado que noto una prosa más clara y más amena que en la Ilíada, más allá de estar escrita en hexámetros. Tal vez sea cierto lo que dicen los historiadores acerca de Homero y es que puede que separen a la Ilíada de la Odisea muchísimos años.Es como que la primera fue relatada por un jovencísimo Homero, tal vez de 25 años, digamos, mientras que la segunda tienen otro tenor en sus hexámetros, como si las hubiera relatado un Homero de sesenta años.Yendo a la historia propiamente, en la Odisea nos encontramos nuevamente con la intervención divina, con la diferencia de que en este libro no son tantos los dioses que aparecen. Díria que son cuatro: Poseidón, Zeus, Palas Atenea y Hermes.La historia comienza cuando Homero narra la desgracia de Ulises mientras es retenido en una cueva por la ninfa Calipso quien a cambio le ofrece la inmortalidad. Palas Atenea oye los ruegos que le hace Ulises y lo libera, más le advierte que sufrirá muchos males y la muerte merodeará siempre a su alrededor.Por el otro lado se viven las angustiosas horas de su esposa, la discreta Penélope y su único hijo Telémaco con el agravante de que creyendo la supuesta muerte del héroe es, su palacio visitado por muchos pretendientes, quienes comienzan a devastar todos las riquezas que Ulises dejó asi como cortejar también a Penélope para desposarla. Esto lleva a Telémaco a emprender un viaje en busca de su padre primero a Pilos y luego a Esparta en donde se encuentra con viejos héroes de guerra como el anciano Néstor y el átrida Menelao, hermano de Agamenón.Ulises, en su travesía llega a Feacia en donde es recibido con amabilidad y honores. Allí encontrará a Demódoco, un aedo ciego, lo que nos hace pensar que Homero se homenajea a sí mismo para formar parte de las leyendas que este libro narra.Pronto se tornará tortuosa su travesía y comienzan sus males cuando desata la furia del dios Poseidón por asesinar a su hijo (son tres los dioses más importantes en la mitología griega: Zeus, rey del Olimpo, portador de la égida y dueño del rayo y el trueno, Poseídon, quien sacude la tierra y controla los mares y Hades quien gobierna el Tártaro y el mundo de los muertos), el cíclope Polifemo que mantiene cautivo a Ulises y sus hombres en una caverna.También tiene especial climax su encuentro con Circe, la perversa diosa que convierte a los dioses en animales que pone a Ulises y todos hombres a prueba y más tarde las cosas se ponen realmente negras durante su llegada a la isla donde pastan las Vacas del Sol, ya que serán castigados duramente y funesto será el desenlace que vivencien.Más allá de tantas desgracias, siempre, en toda la historia, es Palas Atenea la diosa de proteger tanto a Ulises como a Penélope y Telémaco durante sus reiterados infortunios y cuenta además con la ayuda fundamental de otro dios: Hermes (o Mercurio en la mitología romana) cuando con \"palabras aladas\" deben hecerse llegar a uno u otros los mensajes más importantes.Pero durará poco la paz para Ulises cuando ya lejos de Feacia tendrá que afrontar lo que Poseidón le tiene conjurado en su destino: sortear el acecho de las Sirenas que para muchos es la forma más fácil de identificar al libro, aunque a este encuentro Homero le dedica sólo una pequeña porción de hexámetros.Para mí, el escollo más difícil, y mortal que debe sortear Ulises es en el estrecho entre dos los peñascos en los que se encuentran las infernales criaturas marinas que son Escila y Caribdes y es creo el peor momento que vive en toda su travesía. La muerte hace estragos en este pasaje.Otro capitulo que me apasionó es su viaje hasta el Hades porque me hizo recordar al inovidable Canto VI de la Eneida cuando Eneas desciende a los infiernos para rescatar a su padre Anquises y por supuesto, al Infierno de Dante junto a Virgilio, quien casualmente creador de la Eneida.Todo esto forma parte de la \"ilación universal\", como dice un querido amigo mío.En el Hades, pasados los campos de Asfódelo, Ulises se reencontrará con las sombras de sus amigos muertos en la batallas en Troya. Desfilarán ante él Agamenón, asi también como la sombra su amada madre, muerta de pena, a Tiresias, el adivino ciego tebano (sí, el mismo que aparece en la tragedia Edipo Rey de Sófocles), a su admiradísimo e ilustre Pélida, Aquiles, a la sombra del bravo Ayax Telamonio ofendido y también un desfile innumerable de seres mitológicos como los titanes Tántalo, Sísifo y Hércules, hijo de Zeus. Le es encomendado enfrentarse con la gorgona Perséfone, pero no se arriesga y sigue su camino.Y así, un día llega finalmente a su amada Ítaca, pero no será fácil tener a su esposa e hijos en sus brazos. Disfrazado por Palas Atenea como un mendigo deberá vivir un sinfín de deshonras y desgracias más aún ante una caterva de desagradables pretendientes que esquilman y saquean los bienes de su morada. Tanta insolencia los hará pagar caro, puesto que Ulises divino junto con su hijo telémaco, Eumeo y Filetio convertirá los pisos del palacio en un auténtico río de sangre, necesario para finalmente abrazar a su amada esposa y a su anciano padre Laertes.Finalmente reinará la paz porque Zeus, ante los ruegos de Palas Atenea así lo dispuso.Veinte años no es nada, agudísimo Ulises.Puedes descansar tranquilo, ya que el fin justificó los medios."

        "user_review": "Trojan War is ended and the Greeks are returning home with victory and their loot. But the homecoming is not so easy, for they have to struggle with their fate and the wrath of the Olympian gods they incurred. This is greater so for Odysseus, the greek warrior from Ithaca who played a key role in the Trojan War. His fate assures his return but his sudden incurring the wrath of Poseidon (the sea god) makes that returning almost perilous. Odysseus faces many adventures on his journey home which tests his strength and courage, and on his return, finds his household in greater calamity. It is this tale of Odysseus that Homer recounts inThe Odyssey.The many adventures Odysseus faces on his return journey were quite daunting and perilous. They try his strength of mind. But Odysseus is resourceful and cunning, and although he despairs at times, his steadfast courage sees him through the journey back home and restores his position as the king of Ithaca. Odysseus is a story of faith, courage, endurance, and strength of mind to fight all obstacles and attain your desired end. One can say to that extent, Homer's story is quite inspirational.But the beauty of this epic poem is its quality as a work of art. It is both picturesque and dramatic with a touch of fantasy. Homer takes us to a fantastic world through Odysseus's voyage home, and we meet so many mythological characters - gods, men, and other creatures included. Odysseus's adventures are interesting to read. I enjoyed the journey Homer took me through this tale very much.The prosaic translation I read contributed much to my enjoyment of this epic poem. It was an easy read and not too modern in the language which suited the antiquity of this Homeric tale. This reading taught me the importance of using the correct translation to match one's temperament. I enjoyed this work of Homer very much, something I couldn't say ofThe Iliad. And now I know where to lay the blame. :)"

I found the language a bit hard at first, but once I got used to it (which didn't take all too long), I was able to fully enjoy the story.

P. Cavafy Translated by Edmund KeeleyΚι αν πτωχική την βρεις, η Ιθάκη δεν σε γέλασε. Έτσι σοφός που έγινες, με τόση πείρα, ήδη θα το κατάλαβες η Ιθάκες τι σημαίνουν.Η ψυχή μου το ξέρει, πόσο μεγάλη ανάγκη το είχα να το κάνω ξανά αυτό το μεγάλο ταξίδι μαζί με τον πολύπαθο Οδυσσέα. Και διάλεξα τη μετάφραση εκείνη, την πρώτη, απο τα σχολικά μου χρόνια, του Ζήσιμου Σίδερη, αλλά είχα από δίπλα και το αρχαίο κείμενο για να παίρνω διπλή χαρά, από τη γλώσσα μου αυτήν την πανάρχαια, τις λέξεις που ακόμα μιλούμε και που με αυτές ακόμα και σήμερα, εκφράζουμε τις χαρές, τους πόνους, τις αγωνίες και τις ελπίδες μας.Και η αγαπημένη μου η Αθηνά... Κάθε μέρα, καθώς το λεωφορείο παίρνει τη στροφή στη διασταύρωση της Βασιλίσσης Σοφίας, στην Πλατεία Συντάγματος, στρέφω το βλέμμα για μια στιγμή, να δω μέσα από τα τσιμέντα και το καυσαέριο, πάνω απ' τους βιαστικούς διαβάτες, τον Ιερό της Βράχο, κάτω από τον ίδιο ουρανό, που είτε γκρίζος είτε καταγάλανος και ηλιόλουστος, είναι ο ίδιος ουρανός κάτω από τον οποίο αιώνες τώρα στέκει ο τόπος μου και μιλιέται η γλώσσα μου. Κι όταν μου σώνεται καμιά φορά ο αέρας, από τις δυσκολίες της ζωής, έχω ανάγκη σε αυτόν το βράχο να καταφεύγω, ικέτιδα, για να ανασάνω. Και παίρνω δύναμη από τις παλιές πανανθρώπινες ιστορίες κι έτσι κατηφορίζω πάλι ξανά μέσα στην γκρίζα πόλη, γιατρεμένη.Η Αθηνά με την μορφή του Μέντη του αρχηγού των Ταφιωτών πάει στην Ιθάκη στο παλάτι του Οδυσσέα, βρίσκει τον νεαρό του γιο, τον Τηλέμαχο και τον συμβουλεύει να μην κάθεται άλλο ανάμεσα στους μνηστήρες, αλλά να πάρει ένα καράβι και να επισκεφτεί το Νέστορα στην Πύλο και τον Μενέλαο στην Σπάρτη, για να μάθει νέα για τον χαμένο του πατέρα, που είκοσι χρόνια τώρα λείπει από την Ιθάκη, και δεν ξέρει κανένας αν ζει ή αν πέθανε. Ο νέος φεύγει κρυφά, κι όταν το πληροφορούνται οι μνηστήρες σχεδιάζουν στην επιστροφή να τον σκοτώσουν, αλλά το θράσος τους δεν θα τους βγει σε καλό καθώς άλλες είναι οι βουλές των θεών.Ξανά με παρακίνηση της Αθηνάς, φτάνει ο Ερμής στη νησί της Ωγυγίας, εκεί που η Καλυψώ κρατάει, από έρωτα, αιχμάλωτο τον Οδυσσέα και της δίνει εντολή να τον αφήσει να φύγει, για το νησί των Φαιάκων. Εκεί παρουσιάζεται μια από τις ωραίες περιγραφές που δεν χόρταινα να διαβάζω παλιά, όταν ήμουν ακόμη μαθήτρια στο Γυμνάσιο:\"όσο που βρήκε μια σπηλιά μεγάλη, όπου η νεράιδακαθόντανε η λαμπρόμαλλη και μέσα εκεί την ήβρε.Φωτιά μεγάλη είχε στη στια και μια ευωδιά απ' αλάργαμοσκοβολούσε στο νησί, κέδρου κι αφράτης θούγιαςπου καίγουνταν. Κι η Καλυψώ, μ' ολόχρυση σαΐταστον αργαλειό της ύφαινε και γλυκοτραγουδούσε.Φούντωνε γύρω στη σπηλιά δροσολουσμένο δάσοςμε κυπαρίσσια ευωδιαστά, με πεύκες και με σκλήθρα,όπου πλατύφτερα πουλιά φωλιάζανε εκεί πάντα,γεράκια κι ανοιχτόφωνες κουρούνες, βαρδολούπεςθαλασσοπούλια που αγαπούν τα πέλαγα να σκίζουν.Κι ολόγυρα στην κουφωτή σπηλιά ήταν απλωμένη,κληματαριά πολύβλαστη σταφύλια φορτωμένη.Τέσσερεις βρύσες στη στεριά γλυκό νερό αναβρύζαν,κοντά-κοντά, κι άλλη απ' αλλού κυλούσε τα νερά της.Κι ανθούσαν γύρω στη σειρά λιβάδια με γιοφύλιακαι σέλινα, που αν τα 'βλεπε κι αθάνατος ακόμα,θα σάστιζε και μέσα του θα ξάνοιγε η καρδιά του\".Έτσι φεύγει, γεμάτος χαρά ο Οδυσσέας, μέσα σε μια σχεδία, αλλά έμελλε να φτάσει στο νησί των Φαιάκων ναυαγός, καθώς ο Ποσει��ώνας σήκωσε θαλασσοταραχή για να τον πνίξει, αλλά η Ινώ του έδωσε το αθάνατο μαντήλι της και τον έσωσε. Κι όταν η κόρη του βασιλιά Αλκίνοου και της σεβάσμια Αρήτης, η Ναυσικά, τον βρίσκει ναυαγό, δεν αργεί ο ήρωας να φτάσει στο παλάτι και να βρει βοήθεια. Εκεί διηγείται όλες τις περασμένες του περιπέτειες (η αφηγηματική τεχνική του in medias res).Και αν πέρασε περιπέτειες ο θαλασσοδαρμένος ήρωας... Από τους Κίκονες και τους Λωτοφάγους, στη χώρα των Κυκλώπων όπου με τέχνασμα (Ούτις εμοί γ' όνομα) ο ήρωας και οι σύντροφοί του σώζονται από τον ανθρωποφάγο γίγαντα, αφού πρώτα τον μεθύσουν και τον τυφλώσουν:«Τι σου 'τυχε, Πολύφημε, και μεγαλοφωνάζειςμες στην αθάνατη νυχτιά και μας χαλάς τον ύπνο;Μην άθελά σου σ' άρπαξε κανένας το κοπάδι;Μήνα σου παίρνει τη ζωή μ' απάτη και μ' αντρεία;».Κι ο φοβερός Πολύφημος απ' τη σπηλιά απαντούσε·«Αδέρφια, μ' έφαγε ο Κανείς μ' απάτη, όχι μ' αντρεία».Κι εκείνοι τ' απαντούσανε με πεταχτά ��ους λόγια«Αφού κανείς δε σ' έβλαψε και μέσα είσαι μονάχος,απ' την αρρώστια ποιος μπορεί του Δία να σε σώσει;Δεήσου στον πατέρα σου το σείστη Ποσειδώνα».Κι από εκεί στην Αιολία, όπου ο Αίολος έκλεισε σε έναν ασκό όλους τους ανέμους κι άφησε μόνο την πνοή του Ζέφυρου να τους γυρίσει στην πατρίδα, και πράγματι μετά από δέκα μέρες θαλασσινής πορείας έφτασαν τα καράβια να βλέπουν από μακριά τη στεριά της Ιθάκης. Αλλά οι ανόητοι σύντροφοι του Οδυσσέα άνοιξαν τον ασκό και επέστρεψαν στο νησί του Αιόλου. Κι από εκεί αποδιωγμένοι έφτασαν στην Τηλέπυλο, τη γη των Λαιστρυγόνων, από όπου μόνο το καράβι του Οδυσσέα γλίτωσε. Κι από εκεί στο νησί της Αίας όπου η Κίρκη μεταμόρφωσε τους συντρόφους του σε γουρούνια.Κι από εκεί διασχίζοντας τον Ωκεανό, φτάνει ο ήρωας να κάνει ζωντανός (δίταφος - δισθανής) ο ίδιος, κατάβαση στους νεκρούς του Άδη, για να πάρει χρησμό από τον Τειρεσία για το πώς θα επιστρέψει στην πατρίδα. Και τον συμβούλεψε ο σοφός μαντης να μη φάνε τα βόδια του Ήλιου σαν βρεθούν στο νησί της Θρινακίας. Κι έπειτα πέρασε από τις Σειρήνες, τη Σκύλλα και τη Χάρυβδη κι έφτασε στο νησί του Ήλιου, όπου οι σύντροφοί του σπρωγμένοι από την πείνα παραβίασαν τον χρησμό και έτσι όλοι χάθηκαν εκτός από τον ίδιο τον Οδυσσέα που κατέληξε ναυαγός και αιχμάλωτος, εραστής της Καλυψώς που ήθελε να τον κάνει αθάνατο.Κι από εκεί στο νησί των Φαιάκων επιστρέφει ο ήρωας στην Ιθάκη γεμάτος δώρα, αλλά οι περιπέτειές του δεν τελειώνουν εδώ. Αρχικά δεν αναγνωρίζει τον ίδιο του τον τόπο καθώς έχουν περάσει τόσα χρόνια. Με την παρέμβαση της Αθηνάς που τον μεταμορφώνει σε γέρος επαίτη, φτάνει, αγνώριστος στην καλύβα του Εύμαιου του χοιροβοσκού.Ο Εύμαιος, ο πιστός, ο αφοσιωμένος, ο σοφός και φιλόξενος, δεν είναι ένας απλός δούλος του Οδυσσέα. Σαν ήταν μικρό παιδάκι, γιος βασιλιά, τον απήγαγαν κι έτσι βρέθηκε να υπηρετεί την οικογένεια του Λαέρτη στην Ιθάκη. Γι' αυτόν ο Όμηρος επιφυλάσσει μια ιδιαίτερη τιμή, κάθε φορά που μιλάει στο έργο, ο ποιητής απευθύνεται σε αυτόν στο β ενικό (τον δ' απαμειβόμενος προσέφης, Εύμαιε συβώτα):Τότε, Εύμαιε χοιροβοσκέ, τ' απάντησες κι έτσι είπες·Δεν το 'χω, γέρο, σε καλό τον ξένο ν' αψηφήσω,χειρότερός σου κι αν ερθεί. Γιατί σταλτοί απ' το Δίαείναι όλοι οι ξένοι και οι φτωχοί. Το δόσιμό μας λίγομα πρόσχαρο.Έτσι μεταμορφωμένος, καθώς επιστρέφει και ο Τηλέμαχος από το ταξίδι του, φτάνει στο παλάτι του, ζητιάνος, υπόκειται σε ταπεινώσεις και εξευτελισμούς από τους μνηστήρες, ώσπου, ξανά με την ενθάρρυνση της Αθηνάς, πετάει τα κουρέλια του και αρχίζει μια μάχη που θα ήταν άνιση χωρίς την παρέμβαση της θεάς, καθώς πολεμάνε τέσσερις από τη μια (Οδυσσέας, Τηλέμαχος, Εύμαιος και ο βοσκός Φιλοίτιος) και πάνω από εκατό από την άλλη πλευρά:Δεν είναι μια, δεν είναι δυο δεκάδες οι Μνηστήρεςμόν' είναι ακόμα πιο πολλοί, κι άκου να τους μετρήσω.Απ' το Δουλίχι διαλεχτοί πενήντα δυο λεβέντες,μ' έξι μαζί τους παραγιούς. Κι όσοι ήρθαν απ' τη Σάμη,είναι όλοι είκοσι τέσσερεις. Κι είκοσι βάλε ακόμα,όσοι ήρθαν απ' τη Ζάκυνθο, και δώδεκα απ' το Θιάκι,ατρόμητοι όλοι στην καρδιά. Κι ο Μέδοντας ο κράχτης,κι ο θεϊκός τραγουδιστής, πόχουν κι αυτοί μαζί τους,δυο παραγιούς, στο μοίρασμα των φαγητών τεχνίτες.Μετά τη δολοφονία των μνηστήρων, κι αφού τακτοποιήσει τα του οίκου του ο Οδυσσέας ξανασμίγει με την Πηνελόπη (το θηλυκό πολυμήχανο έτερον ήμισυ ��ου ήρωα, μια γενναία, πανέξυπνη, ευγενική και πιστή σύζυγος και μητέρα) και την επομένη πηγαίνει να συναντήσει τον γέρο πατέρα του, τον Λαέρτη. Και αφού, ξανά με την παρέμβαση της Αθηνάς, αποτρέπεται, την τελευταία στιγμή, η εμφύλια σύγκρουση ανάμεσα στους συγγενείς των μνηστήρων με τον οίκο του Οδυσσέα, η ιστορία τελειώνει, όχι όμως το ταξίδι. Και η ζωή συνεχίζεται...Τα ηρωικά τραγούδια της μυκηναϊκής εποχής, που διηγούνταν τις περιπέτειες των Αχαιών, ανάμεσα σε αυτά κι η διήγηση της πολιορκίας της Τροίας, και η περιπλάνηση του Οδυσσέα, διαμορφώθηκαν μέσα από επαγγελματίες τραγουδιστές με τη συνοδεία ενός έγχορδου οργάνου (αοιδοί) και τους κατοπινότερους ραψωδούς (που έκαναν απαγγελία των ποιημάτων κρατώντας στο δεξί τους χέρι ένα ραβδί) και κάπως έτσι γίνεται το πέρασμα από την αρχαιότερη προφορική παράδοση στα καταγεγραμμένα έπη (ακολουθώντας τον ρυθμό του δακτυλικού εξαμέτρου), όπως αυτά σώζονται ως σήμερα. Στην Οδύσσεια παρουσιάζονται δύο αοιδοί ο Δημόδοκος στους Φαίακες και ο Φήμιος στους Ίθακες.Από εδώ κατέβασα την μετάφραση του Σίδερη, από το σχολικό βιβλίο όπως την διδάχτηκα για πρώτη φορά, στο σχολείο ολάκερη:http://e-library.iep.edu.gr/iep/colle...Από εδώ διάβασα διάφορες σχετικές με τα έπη μελέτες τις οποίες βρήκα ιδιαίτερα χρήσιμες:http://www.greek-language.gr/digitalR..."

        "user_review": "To this day, the most interesting research project that I've ever done was the very first. It was on the Homeric Question.I was a sophomore in college—a student with (unfortunate) literary ambitions who had just decided to major in anthropology. By this point, I had at least tacitly decided that I wanted to be a professor. In my future lay the vast and unexplored ocean of academia. What was the safest vessel to travel into that forbidden wine-dark sea? Research.I signed up for a reading project with an anthropology professor. Although I was too naïve to sense it at the time, he was a man thoroughly sick of his job. Lucky for him, he was on the cusp of retirement. So his world-weariness manifested itself as a total, guilt-free indifference to his teaching duties. Maybe that's why I liked him so much. I envied a man that could apparently care so little about professional advancement. That's what I wanted.In any case, now I had to come up with a research topic. I had just switched into the major, and so had little idea what typical anthropology research projects were like. And because my advisor was so indifferent, I received no guidance from him. The onus lay entirely on me. One night, as I groped half-heartedly through Wikipedia pages, I stumbled on something fascinating, something that I hadn't even considered before.Who is Homer? Nobody knew. Nobody could know. The man—if man he was—was lost to the abyss of time. No trace of him existed. We can't even pin down what century he lived. And yet, we have these glorious poems—poems at the center of our history, the roots of the Western literary canon. Stories of the Greek Gods had fascinated me since my childhood; Zues and Athena were as familiar as Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. That the person (or persons) responsible could be so totally lost to history baffled me—intrigued me.But I was not majoring in literature or the humanities. I was in anthropology, and so had to do a proper anthropological project. At the very least, I needed an angle.Milman Parry and Albert Lord duly provided this angle. The two men were classicists—scholars of ancient Greece. But instead of staying in their musty offices reading dusty manuscripts, they did something no classicist had done before: they attempted to answer the Homeric question withfield work.At the time (and perhaps now?) a vibrant oral tradition existed in Serbo-Croatia. Oral poets (guslars, they're called there) would tell massive stories at public gatherings, some stories even approaching the length of the Homeric poems. But what was most fascinating was that these stories were apparently improvised.In our decadent culture, we have a warped idea of improvisation. Many of us believe improvisation to be the spontaneous outflowing of creative energies, manifesting themselves in something totally new. Like God shaping the Earth out of the infinite void, these imaginary improvisers shape their art from nothing whatsoever. Unfortunately, this never happens.Whether you're a jazz saxophonist playing on a Coltrane tune, a salesperson dealing with a new client, or an oral bard telling a tale, improvisation is done via a playful recombining of preexisting, formulaic elements. This was Milman and Parry's great discovery. By carefully transcribing hundreds of these Serbo-Croation poems, they discovered that—although a single poem may vary from person to person, place to place, or performance to performance—the variation took place within predictable boundaries.The poet's brains were full of stock-phrases (\"when dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more\"), common epithets (\"much-enduring Odysseus\"), and otherwise formulaic verses that allowed them to quickly put together their poems. Individual scenes, in turn, also followed stereotypical outlines—feasts, banquets, catalogues of forces, battles, athletic contests, etc. Of course, this is not to say that the poet was not original. Rather, it is to say that they are just as original as John Coltrane or Charlie Parker—individuals working within a tradition. These formulas and stereotypical scenes were the raw material with which the poet worked. They allowed him to compose material quickly enough to keep up the performance, and not break his rhythm.But could poems as long asThe OdysseyandThe Iliadcome wholly from an oral tradition? It seems improbable: it would take multiple days to recite, and the bard would have to pick up where he left off. But Milman and Parry, during their fieldwork, managed to put our fears at rest. They found a singer that could (and did) compose poems equal in length to Homer's. (I actually read one. It's calledThe Wedding of Smailagic Meho, and was recited by a poet named Avdo. It's noOdyssey, but still entertaining.)All this is impressive, but one question remained: how could the oral poems get on paper? Did an oral poet—Homer, presumably—learn to write, and copy it down? Not possible, says Alfred Lord, in his bookThe Singer of Tales. According to him, once a person becomes literate, the frame of mind required to learn the art of oral poetry cannot be achieved. A literate person thinks of language in an entirely different way as a non-literate one, and so the poems couldn't have been written by a literate poet who had learned from his oral predecessors.According to Lord, this left only one option: Homer must have been a master oral poet, and his poems must have been transcribed by someone else. (This is how the aforementioned poem by Avdo was taken down by the researchers.) At the time, this struck me as perfectly likely—indeed, almost certain. But the more I think about it, the less I can imagine an oral poet submitting himself to sit with a scribe, writing in the cumbersome Linear B script, for the dozens and dozens of hours it would have taken to transcribe these poems. It's possible, but seems unlikely.But according to Ruth Finnegan, Alfred Lord's insistence that literacy destroys the capacity to improvise poems is mistaken. An anthropologist, Finnegan found many cases in Africa of semi-literate or fully literate people who remained capable of improvising poetry. So it's at least equally possible that Homer was an oral poet who learned to read, and then decided to commit the poems to paper (or whatever they were writing on back then).I submit this longwinded overview of the Homeric Question because, despite my usual arrogance, I cannot even imagine writing a 'review' for this poem. I feel like that would be equivalent to 'reviewing' one's own father and mother. For me, and everyone alive in the Western world today,The Odysseyis flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood. Marvelously sophisticated, fantastically exciting, it is the alpha and omega of our tradition. From Homer we sprang, and unto Homer shall we return.[Note:I'd also like to add that this time, my third or forth time through the poem, I decided to go through it via audiobook. Lucky for me, the Fagles translation (a nice one if you're looking for readability) is available as an audiobook, narrated by the great Sir Ian McKellen. It was a wonderful experience, not only because Sir Ian has such a beautiful voice (he's Gandalf, after all), but because hearing itreadrather than reading it recreated, however dimly, the original experience of the poem: as a performance. I highly recommend it.]"

        "user_review": "La Odisea me ha gustado muchísimo más que la Ilíada, ya que no se me hizo tan pesada. Sin embargo, considero que es necesario leer esta última primero para tener más contexto en este libro, ya que aparecen personajes del pasado y se deja en claro cuál fue el desenlace mismo de ellos. Es lo más recomendable.La historia empiezain media res,cuando muchos de los eventos ya han sucedido y algunos ya están evolucionando (luego del desenlace de la Guerra de Troya, los problemas que se le han presentado a Ulises en su regreso a casa, Penélope y sus pretendientes, Telémaco en busca de su padre, etc). Trama y subtramas por varios lados; historias entre historias.La Odisea utiliza tantos tópicos literarios que a mí me fascinan. Comenzando por la seducción, la tentación, la fidelidad/infidelidad, la soledad, la muerte, el anhelo, la astucia y sagacidad del protagonista para salir con vida de variadas situaciones, conspiraciones, venganza, el viaje del héroe con retorno a casa: y a su misma vez la importancia de la familia y el hogar. Pruebas, presagios y la lealtad puesta sobre la mesa.Toda una aventura para Ulises; quien es un líder con defectos y virtudes, que luego de meter la pata es capaz de crear planes ingeniosos para salirse con la suya. Es quizás por eso que me fascinó el libro, ya que Ulises muy por el contrario a Aquiles utiliza la inteligencia. Es un héroe que aprende de sus errores anteriores, por lo que no los vuelve a cometer y ejecuta sus propósitos con mayor cuidado y paciencia; ya no tan a la ligera, por lo que no se deja llevar por impulsos emocionales que de nada le sirven.Pasamos de isla en isla, recorremos tempestuosos mares y conocemos a la ninfa Calipso y Circe la hechicera. Con seres mitológicos como las criaturas marinas escila y caribdis, los gigantes, cícloples, sirenas y los tan temidos y omnipotentes dioses del Olimpo, aunque aquí solo tenemos como presencia absoluta a Atenea y en parte toman importancia Poseidón y Zeus.Ha sido un largo viaje para Ulises ir a la batalla y regresar a su patria; en el que diez años le costó la guerra de Troya lejos de su familia y diez años más regresar con ellos por la ira de Poseidón. Veinte años y toda una verdadera odisea para el pobre."

        "user_review": "It's funny how many people feel intimidated by this book. Sure, it's thousands of years old, and certainly Greek culture has some peculiarities, but the book is remarkably, sometimes surprisingly modern, and most translations show the straightforward simplicity of the story.Perhaps like The Seventh Seal, The Odyssey has gotten a reputation for being difficult because it has been embraced by intellectuals and worse, wanna-be intellectuals. But like Bergman's classic film, The Odyssey is focused on action, low humor, and vivid characters, not complex symbolism and pretension.It shouldn't really surprise us how modern the story seems, from it's fast-paced action to its non-linear story: authors have taken cues from it for thousands of years, and continue to take inspiration from it today. Any story of small people, everyday heroes, and domestic life we read today is only a few steps removed from Odysseus' tale.Unlike the Iliad, this book is not focused on grand ideas or a grand stage. The characters do not base their actions on heroic ideals but on their emotions, their pains and joys, their grumbling bellies. It is less concerned with the fate of nations than the state of the family and friendship.Since the story turns on whims instead of heroic ideals, it is much less focused than the Iliad, meandering from here to there in a series of unconnected vignettes drawn from the mythic tradition. Like The Bible, it is a combination of stories, but without a philosophical focus.There are numerous recurring themes that while not concluded, are certainly explored. The most obvious of these may be the tradition of keeping guests in Greece. The most honorable provide their guests with feasts, festivals, and gifts. This seems mostly the effect of a noblesse oblige among the ruling class.Like the codes of war or the class system, it is a social structure which benefits their rulership. Like the palace of Versailles of Louis XIV, keeping someone as a guest was a way to keep an eye on them and to provide camaraderie and mutual reliance amongst the fractitious ruling class.The second theme is that of 'metis', represented by Odysseus himself. Metis is the Greek term for cunning. It is a quick-witted cleverness that is sometimes considered charming and other times deceitful. Achilles tells Odysseys in the Iliad that he resents the clever man's entreaties, and those of any man who says one thing but thinks another.Odysseus later mimics this sentiment as part of an elaborate lie to gain the trust of another man. Such are the winding ways of our hero. He misleads his son, his wife, his servants, and his despondent father after his return, careful not to overplay his hand in a dangerous situation, arriving as a stranger.Each of these prevarications can be seen sometimes as cruel, but each deception has a reasoning behind it. He uses his stories to carefully prepare his listeners for his return, instead of springing it upon them unwarned. He ensures that he will be received upon the most profitable terms, though he also enjoys the game of it all.These acts of sudden, cruel cleverness are not uncommon in epics and adventure tales. One tale of Viking raiders tells of how, after sailing into the Mediterranean, their ship reached one of the cities of the Roman Empire. Though just a small outpost, the Viking chief thought it was Rome itself, since its stone buildings towered over the farms of his homeland.He hid in a coffin with a wealth of swords and had his soldiers bear him into the town, telling the inhabitants they wished to make burial rights for their dead king. When they were let in, the coffin was opened, the swords passed around, and the city sacked. What is curious is that while warriors like the Greeks or Vikings maintained a strict sense of honor and honesty, this kind of trick was not only common in their stories, but admired.The honor of the battlefield does not extend to the Trojan Horse (Odysseus' idea) or to the tale of Sinon in the Aeneid. The rule seems to be that if the tricks played are grand and clever enough, they are allowed, while small, mean pranks and betrayals are not. Not all the soldiers agree what is outsmarting and what is dishonorable (Achilles puts Odysseus in the latter camp), but there is a give and take there.What is most remarkable about Odysseus is not merely that he comes up with these tricks, but that he passes them off on proud, honorable men without incurring their wrath. Moreover, he does all this while having a famous reputation for being tricky. You'd think he'd get an intentional walk now and then.Odysseus was not as strong a character as Achilles or Hector were in the Iliad, though this may be because he was a complex character who did not rely on the cliche characterizations of 'the noble warrior'. He is not a man with a bad temper, nor a good one. He is a competent and powerful warrior and leader, but those are not his defining characteristics, either.Odysseus represents the Greek ideal of 'arete' as well as metis. Arete is the idea that a man who is truly great should excel in all things, not merely concentrate on one area of life. Even raging Achilles showed the depth of his arete in the Iliad when he served as host and master of the games. He was capable of nobility, sound judgment, and generosity, even if he didn't always put his best foot forward.Odysseus is likewise skilled in both war and domesticity, in the sword and politics, and he's clever and wily to boot. In the end, there isn't much room left over for negative character traits, which is what makes him feel a bit flat. What makes people interesting as individuals is not their best traits, but their worst.For Odysseus, this is his pride. After spending twenty years of his life away at war, leaving his wife and infant son behind, it's not surprising that he wants to return home with wealth and with his name on the lips of poets and minstrels.Between his pride, his easy smile, and his quick wit, he is the model for the modern action hero. He is not merely some chivalric picture of goodness, nor simply mighty and overwhelming, but a conflicted man with a wry sense of humor and above all, a will to survive.Don't read this book simply because it is old, influential, and considered great. Read it because it is exciting and approachable and thoughtful. Even without all the reputation, it can stand on its own.I read the Fagles translation, which was enjoyable and often lovely, though some modern idioms did slip in here and there. The Knox intro rehashes a lot of the introduction to The Iliad, but it's still very useful."

        "user_review": "I started this as Iwas toldit is essential reading if I ever want to give a shot at readingUlysses. I was a bit apprehensive and spent a long time deciding on which translation to choose. Finally it wasStephen's reviewthat convinced me to go for theRobert Fagles' version. I have no way of judging how good a decision that was.This translation, by Robert Fagles, is of the Greek text edited by David Monro and Thomas Allen, first published in 1908 by the Oxford University Press. This two-​volume edition is printed in a Greek type, complete with lower- and uppercase letters, breathings and accents, that is based on the elegant handwriting of Richard Porson, an early-​nineteenth-​century scholar of great brilliance, who was also an incurable alcoholic as well as a caustic wit. This was of course not the first font of Greek type; in fact, the first printed edition of Homer, issued in Florence in 1488, was composed in type that imitated contemporary Greek handwriting, with all its complicated ligatures and abbreviations. Early printers tried to make their books look like handwritten manuscripts because in scholarly circles printed books were regarded as vulgar and inferior products — cheap paperbacks, so to speak.First up, I enjoyed the book, even the droll parts. It was fun to repeatedly read Odysseus's laments and Telemachus' airy threats about the marauding suitors.But now that I have finished it, how do I attempt a review? What can I possibly say about an epic like this that has not been said before? To conclude by saying that it was wonderful would be a disservice. To analyse it would be too self-important and to summarize it would be laughable.Nevertheless, I thought of giving a sort of moral summary of the story and then abandoned that. I then considered writing about the many comparisons it evoked it my mind about the Indian epics that I have grown up with, but I felt out of my depth since I have not even read the Iliad yet.With all those attempts having failed, I am left with just repeating again that it was much more enjoyable than I expected. That is not to say that it was an epic adventure with no dull moments. No. The characters repeat themselves in dialogue and in attitude, all major dramatic points are revealed in advance as prophesy and every important story event is told again at various points by various characters.Even though I avoided it as much as I can, I could not at times avoid contrasting my reading experience with that of the epics I have grown up with and I remember thinking to myself that in comparison this reads like a short story or a novella. Maybe this impression is because I am largely yet unaware of the large mythical structure on which the story is built. I intend to allay that deficiency soon.The characters are unforgettable, the situations are legendary and I am truly happy that I finally got around to a full reading of this magnificent epic. It has opened up a new world."

Alas, I'm better now and am pleased to finally get a chance to \"review\" this beauty! In keeping with my self-enforced regulation on bringing an unparalleled level of sophistication and succinctness to my analyses of these illustrious cornerstones of Western Mythology, I'll be covering the themes that stood out most prominently to me and strictly in the most intellectual and earnest fashion.\"Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest!\"TheGuest-Host Code of Conductis a constant throughout Homer's poem and, when compared to the state of modern hospitality, it becomes clear that we've lost our way; By the river Styx, woe be us, we have lost our way! Not once do I recall a host ever offering to have me bathed, rubbed down with oil and dressed in a fine robe when I've deigned to visit their abode. What has come of us?! Has Zeus, being the God this most concerns, lost his zeal for the divine enforcement of the etiquette of hospitality? For the love of the Gods, lather me! And forgetnotto bestow upon me a parting gift!In general, a host is most likely to be at fault in the interaction between guest and host if they don't properly cater to any wayward soul that stumbles upon their palace but the opposite can also be seen in the 108 suitors who, in attempting to court the absent Odysseus' wife, Penelope, in a brutish, non-ritualistic manner, take advantage of their host's hospitality, consuming their reserves of food and wine and ravishing their female servants.If the domestic settings of Homer's epics are at all reflective of Ancient Greek society in the time they were written, there is an interesting parallel regarding ritual propriety and even, to a lesser degree, filial piety with Chinese culture in the time of Confucius, several hundred years later.\"The fame of her great virtue will never die.The immortal gods will lift a song for all mankind,A glorious song in praise of self-possessed Penelope\"- AgamemnonLoyaltyand faithfulness, in all their forms are a big one and nobody embodies these more than Odysseus' wife, Penelope, the soul of loyalty! (Besides maybe Argos, the loyal dog) Despite Odysseus advising her to wed the man she likes as soon as she sees hair on, their son, Telemachus' face, she holds out for 20 years despite 108 oily degenerates attempting to court her when it is presumed Odysseus dies at Troy. What a woman! Gents, find yourself a Penelope! Ladies, if the men in this book are anything to go by, I'm afraid you'll probably have to settle for a Pepé Le Pew.It's probably worth noting that Hesiod, Homer's contemporary, states, in his Theogony of the Gods, that Odysseus sired 4 children on his 10-year journey home; 2 with Calypso and 2 with Circe. So, while Penelope was faithfully waiting for him at home, he was gettin' down with 2 Nymph Goddesses (that we know of)! Ok, I'm being a little flippant here; at least one of these was totally against his will*wink, wink, nudge, nudge*. One notices a distinct lack of detail when Odysseus recounts his adventures to his wife.\"When a man cries, it's the last thing he wants to do… He will do anything but cry. He will stop himself crying no matter how tragic it is. And he would do everything, and only when he's completely defeated emotionally will he start to cry properly.\"- Michael CaineMichael Caine obviously never read 'The Odyssey' 'cos whileresilience/perseveranceare another major theme of 'The Odyssey', there is also A LOT of grown ass men crying! There's nothing wrong with that and, in context, I should mention that Caine made that comment in an acting masterclass BUT these are battle-hardened soldiers who are returning home from a 10-year war and have absolutely no qualms raping and pillaging as they go. I hardly think they are the super-sentimental types. I'm not talking a tear trickling down the cheek either; we're talking platoons of soldiers in a communal sob session, wailing, shrieking, going full Timberlake-cry-me-a-river at the slightest provocation! However, once the tears have abated, our characters always push on, particularly Odysseus and \"what good can come of grief?\" appears a recurring rhetorical query and the message appears to be, dust yourself off and carry on!Odysseus is not a great guy really, but his determination and ability to will himself on in the face of great odds is endearing, regardless of his shortcomings. He is the hero of the story and held in high esteem for possessing many of the typical Homeric heroes attributes: Strength, bravery, godly physique, and also diplomacy, tactfulness,cunning and deceitfulness(also seen as a positive attribute). I couldn't help having a bit of a chuckle when Odysseus and a small number of his crew are stuck in, the Cyclops, Polyphemus' cave and trying to deduce a means of escape. Homer is really trying to drive home Odysseus' cunning—\"My wits kept weaving, weaving cunning schemes… till this plan struck my mind as best\"and then:\"Hey, hey, guys, GUYS! Hide yourselves beneath the sheep! Two sheep to a man; except me, I'll take this large one. He'll never see us! Oh, Gods be praised, I'm so cunning; a real clever sausage!\"Odysseus at his finest! A man endowed with the God's own wisdom; foxy, ingenious!.... Anyone who thinks Homer didn't have a sense of humour is kidding themselves.Following a positive experience withRobert Fagles' translationof 'The Iliad', I opted for the deluxe edition of his Odyssey translation for the 'Penguin Classics' line and, once again, I thought it was very readable. It's a non-rhyming verse translation with varying line length. I think it succeeds in sounding traditional while also being absolutely accessible to the modern reader. Fagles mentions something along the lines of Homer's works being quite fast paced and energetic and, without any knowledge of the original, it seems to me that he's succeeded in maintaining this high level of rapidity and excitement. There was only one example of, what I thought was, a poor translation when, at one point, Fagles uses the phrase\"cramping my style\". I'm being knit-picky but it doesn't fit with the overall tone of the rest of the text and feels too modern. Bernard Knox's introduction and notes are also, once again, fascinating and illuminating regarding the origins and the nature of the poem, particularly a discussion on the more prominent (read:existent) role of women in the Odyssey when compared with the sausage-fest that is the Iliad.More than anything, for me, 'The Odyssey' is just a rollicking good adventure! If you're perhaps someone who tried the Iliad and didn't enjoy it (what is wrong with you?!) but really love Mythology retellings, you may very well still love this one which has an entirely different thematic focus and overall tone; less relentless war, more of combination of treachorous journey and domestic affair! I really can't recommend it highly enough.It's asglorious as the young dawn with her rose-red fingers!"

        "user_review": "Book Review4 out of 5 stars toThe Odyssey, published around 800 BC and written byHomer. I was tasked with reading this epic work as part of an Advanced Placement English course in between my junior and senior years of high school. I loved literature back then as much as I do now, and my reading habits probably grew from everything my teachers encouraged us to read during the summer hiatus and mid-year breaks. We sampled literature from all over the world, and this Greek tome was one of the many we read. We only read certain sections, as it's over 500 pages long, but I finished it on my own over winter break that year. It often depends on the translation version you read, as it might make it better or worse for you. I don't recall which one the teacher selected, but it must have been good as I did my quarterly papers on both this book and Homer's other work,The Iliad. The Odyssey was an amazing tale of a journey through the famed Trojan Wars in ancient Greece. Meeting all the gods and goddesses, understanding the genealogy and family structure, the plots between all their shenanigans and games... for someone with my hobbies and interests, this was perfect. The only part I found a bit dull was when it truly went into war-time battle descriptions, as reading details about fighting is not typically something I enjoy. But the soap opera-like quality of these characters cum deity realities was just absorbing fun. The lyrics and the words fly off the pages. The images and the metaphors are pretty. And if you know enough about Greek history, you almost feel as if you're in the story.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

Each night after dinner, we listened to a half an hour lecture or read from a classic text. It's become a habit or rather a household ritual in which even our dog partakes. (She has a chair she sits in while we listen.) We studied history, philosophy, mythology, and when omicron threatened, we decided to re-read Homer. It has been magical, therapeutic even. On Saturday, we finished the Odyssey.Living in such trying times makes me long for something of lasting quality. Emily Wilson's exquisite translation of Odysseus's tumultuous ten-year journey home from Troy helped me grapple with the precariousness of the human condition and our own mortality. We listened to Claire Danes read and simultaneously read along. Homer is meant to be heard, and Danes gives an outstanding performance. Our understanding of the text was enhanced by interspersing Elizabeth Vandiver's excellent lectures throughout our reading. Our journey with Odysseus, Penelope, and Telemachus provided a needed uplift for us as it has for others over the past 2,500 years. Highly recommend.Thanks to Bruce Katz for recommending Emily Wilson's translation."

        "user_review": "I'm not a scholar, so I can only offer my personal experience.First, I want to say that I thought this would be a daunting task - an epic poem!? From Ancient Greece!? But, it was such an enjoyable and accessible read, I'm grateful to my goodreads friend who encouraged me to move forward.Second, I highly recommend this version, published by Penguin, written in prose, and covered in a pretty design, by Coralie Bickford-Smith. Not only is it gorgeous on your shelf, it's physically comfortable to read, with its perfect size and soothing ivory pages.As for the story, it's full of action and imagination, fun characters and fantastical creatures. I especially enjoyed Odysseus' fanciful encounters and challenges with these creatures, with the underworld, and with the goddesses. I was disappointed by how little effort was put into his time with Calypso, and adored his time with Circe. (If you haven't read Madeline Miller's \"Circe,\" and you enjoy mythology, please do).The story slowed for me when he returned home. Odysseus is portrayed as a character of wit, clever manipulation and disguise. Much of his return is dedicated to this display, and I found myself wondering why I had to read full, false accounts of his adventures as he told them while in disguise. According to some quick internet research, the purpose of these passages was to show his intelligence by how he wove truth into fiction, and so was able to inhabit a new identity. But, I found these - after experiencing his dramatic adventures, pointless, and so motivated to research their point.Don't worry. It gets better again, in my opinion. The ending is plenty dramatic, and completely satisfying.Reading this made me want to reread Circe. I also picked up Atwood's The Penelopiad. Following this thread has been very enjoyable."

        "user_review": "My parents split when I was very young. The arrangement they made between them was that my brother and I would spend the weekends with our father, but would live, during the week, with my mother. One winter, when I was ten years old, it started to snow heavily and gave no indication of stopping any time soon. It was a Sunday morning and my brother and I were due to leave dad's and return to what, for us, was home. The snow, however, had other ideas.To go home we had to catch two buses. The first was running late, but, otherwise, the ride, although slow, was pretty uneventful. We arrived in the centre of Sheffield sometime around one o'clock. It was then that things started to go awry. At the stop where we would usually catch the next bus, which was to take us into Rotherham, there was one already waiting. It did not, however, give the appearance of preparing to go anywhere; the engine was off and the driver was stood outside, smoking a cigarette. Being ten years old I did not want to ask the driver what was happening but I heard another potential passenger enquire as to when we would be allowed to board. 'You won't' said the driver. 'All buses have been cancelled due to the snow. I'm returning to the depot.'At this a strange kind of panic overcame me. My brother and I were halfway between my mother's and my dad's, with no phone and our fare the only money in our pockets. Typically, my brother wanted to wait it out. The buses would start running again soon, he said. But I knew that wasn't the case. The snow had settled, and heavy spidery flakes were still bombing the city. Waiting would only make it harder to walk; and walking, I knew, was inevitable.To return to dad's was, relatively speaking, easier; it was closer and the route was straightforward; but, as when after the split, when we were asked which parent we wanted to live with, we instinctively felt drawn to our mother, despite the inevitable hardships. And so, our decision made, we set off through the snow in the direction of home, following the route the bus would have taken. Yet time and distance, we found, are deceptive. What had taken 25 minutes on a bus, would, we thought, only take us an hour. But the bus wasn't a young child; it wasn't cold and tired and scared. On the bus, home had always seemed close, just around the next corner; but as we mashed through the snow it seemed impossible, unreachable; it seemed, after a couple of hours, as though it no longer existed; nothing existed, except the snow, which is all we could see.Two or three times my brother fell down, and I, almost without stopping, dragged him to his feet, shouting encouragement into the snow. At some point night fell too; and still the heavy spidery flakes came down, punctuating the darkness. By this stage I could not have said why I was doing what I was doing; instinct had kicked in; one foot followed the other, regardless. I remember coming to a distinctive spot, a part of the journey that, by bus, always felt significant, because it meant only another five or ten minutes until we reached home. But on foot, mashing through thick boot-clinging snow, that last leg, which was up hill, seemed monstrous.Eventually we made it, of course. As we descended the hill on the other side we were met by my mother and her then boyfriend, who, we were told, could not bear to wait any longer and had started to walk to meet us on the way. And there it was: home; which is, I found, not a physical building, but the look in my mother's eyes as she ran to greet us.[Odysseus in the Cave of Polyphemus by Jacob Jordaens]The point of this story is to illustrate how universal great literature is, for whenever I think back to that day, which is something that I do quite often, I am immediately reminded of The Odyssey, Homer's immortal poem. My brother and I did not encounter any Sirens, or Lotus Eaters or Cyclops, but our walk through the snow was, in principle, a fight to get home, to overcome adversity and return to the familiar and comfortable. And, on the most basic level, this is just what The Odyssey is about. Following the war at Troy, as he sought to return to Ithica, to his wife and son, Odysseus had stumbled from one disastrous situation to the next, until the great warrior found himself entrapped on an island for seven years by Calypso, a Goddess. Eventually, with the help of Pallas Athena, he is allowed to leave; and so continues his famous, epic quest.\"Men are so quick to blame the gods: they saythat we devise their misery. But theythemselves- in their depravity- designgrief greater than the griefs that fate assigns.\"It may seem like an unusual thing to say about epic poetry, but there is a tremendous amount of dumb fun to be had when reading The Odyssey. The tricking of Polyphemus – who Odysseus gets drunk and subsequently blinds – is probably the most famous episode, but I also particularly enjoyed the beautiful witch Circe, who turns a number of the ship's crew into pigs. To the modern reader, The Odyssey is a fantasy, having much in common with something like The Tempest or A Midsummer's Night Dream or even fairytales; indeed, to highlight a more recent example, one can draw a number of parallels between Homer's work and the Lord of the Rings saga. In this way, I would say that it has a broader appeal, is easier to digest, and certainly contains greater variety, than the brutal, relentless Iliad.Despite the weird creatures, the faraway lands, the quest, and the prominence of a great hero, the heart of The Odyssey is conventional and domestic, in that it is concerned with values such as love and friendship and the importance of family. Again, this is in contrast to The Iliad, where honour and death and war are the focus. When Telemachus, Odysseus' son, goes in search of news of his father he is given hospitality from a number of Odysseus' friends, and their sons and daughters and wives, who are willing to do all they can to help him. Penelope, meanwhile, is, even after a number of years, and not knowing whether her husband is alive or dead, still resisting the suitors who have almost taken over her house. In fact, she even plays a trick on them, promising to take a new husband only after she has finished weaving a shroud, while unpicking it each night to make sure that she never does.\"Now from his breast into the eyes the acheof longing mounted, and he wept at last,his dear wife, clear and faithful, in his arms,longed for as the sunwarmed earth is longed for by a swimmerspent in rough water where his ship went downunder Poseidon's blows, gale winds and tons of sea.Few men can keep alive through a big serfto crawl, clotted with brine, on kindly beachesin joy, in joy, knowing the abyss behind:and so she too rejoiced, her gaze upon her husband,her white arms round him pressed as though forever.\"One thing I find refreshing about Greek myths, and by extension Homer's work, is that women play such a strong role. It's funny how hundreds of years later women would be seen as delicate, incapable creatures who need protecting by being locked up at home, and yet here their position, and personalities, are not dissimilar to the men's. For example, Goddesses are worshipped and invoked just as much as God's, and it is not the case that these Goddesses are concerned with flower arranging and children, they get their hands dirty, intervening and interacting with what is happening on earth, be that war or whatever. In fact, although The Odyssey is certainly Odysseus' story [the clue is in the title], the second most important character is the grey-eyed Pallas Athena. Moreover, as noted earlier, Penelope, although upset that her husband is lost or dead, is no sap, while, conversely, the mighty Odysseus frequently bursts into tears.If you have read any of my reviews you will likely know that, when approaching translated literature, choosing the best translation is, for me, of paramount importance; so much so that there are books that I haven't enjoyed in one translation, and later really liked in another. The question of which translation one should read becomes particularly critical when one is concerned with poetry. Part of me, I must admit, is resistant to the idea of translated poetry altogether, because I just cannot see how it can possibly bear any great or significant resemblance to the original. Yet I think this is less of a danger with epic, narrative poetry; with something like The Odyssey, the translator has a story to tell, and as long as he or she tells it faithfully they have done at least half the job right.For The Iliad I chose Robert Fagles' critically acclaimed version. The reason for this is that I felt that his robust [you might uncharitably call it inelegant] style suited the material. I did, however, cringe frequently at some of his phrasing and word choices, which were far too modern for my taste. Therefore, for The Odyssey I went with Robert Fitzgerald, who, I believe, had a stronger ear for poetry and a more subtle touch. Yet, having said that, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Fitzgerald's rendering to the first time reader of Homer's work. I think the popularity of Fagles' translations has much to do with how accessible they are; the truth is that most people don't care about the use of modern language in an ancient Greek text; in fact, the average reader would likely prefer language that is recognisable to them.In comparison, Firtzgerald's rendering is more of a challenge. Don't get me wrong, his work is still readable and is, for the most part, easy enough to get a handle on, but some of his choices are potentially alienating or disorientating. For example, character and place names are spelt in a way that most of us will not recognise [Calypso is Kalypso, Circe is Kirke, Ithica is Ithika etc]. In most cases, deciphering these is, as you call tell by my examples, not especially difficult, but occasionally the spellings are outright baffling. The worst I can recall is Sirens, which in Fitzgerald's version is Seirenes. When one encounters something like this, one is, unfortunately, taken out of the text as you try and work out what or whom exactly we are dealing with.However, as previously hinted, the strength of his version is that it stands up as poetry. I can't, of course, say that it is the best or most successful version, not having read them all, but it is consistently smooth, beautiful and stirring. There's one line in it, which is repeated throughout the text, about the dawn's 'finger tips of rose,' that I was particularly taken with, and which, moreover, I have seen elsewhere translated in such disappointing and clunky ways.[Odysseus and the Sirens by Herbert James Draper]Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the poem is the sophisticated structure. I expected that it would be episodic, and it is, but I did not anticipate a non-linear narrative. The Odyssey begins in media res, with a significant proportion of the action already in the past. As we enter the story, Odysseus has been missing for many years, the suitors are surrounding his house in an effort to take his wife, and his son is about to begin his own journey for news of his father. Therefore, for quite some time the main character is off-stage, so to speak. When he does appear, he spends much of his time recounting the details of his life following the war in Troy. So, we only have access to the most exciting, and the most famous, episodes as flashbacks.What this highlights is the important role that oral story-telling plays in the text. Throughout, Odysseus and many other characters tell tales, be they fictional or true, as a way or bonding or sharing information or entertaining each other, in the same way that we do now. I have always found this interesting, this seemingly universal, immortal desire to give voice to, and share, stories with other people. It is something, as the rambling introductions to my reviews attest, that I feel compelled to do myself. At one stage, Athena turns Odysseus into a beggar, and the hero creates for him an entire history, fleshing out and breathing life into the character he is playing. So there you have it: a book that shouts loudly about home and family and so on, but which, in a more subtle fashion, is equally concerned with, as well as being itself an example of, the joy and importance of communication and human interaction."

        "user_review": "I immensely enjoyed reading The Iliad, and since everyone said that The Odyssey is even better, I was expecting to love it. That didn't happen. I liked The Odyssey, but I found it to be a lot less compelling than The Iliad, both narratively and thematically. This is strange, I usually prefer adventure tales to war stories, but The Odyssey didn't have the grandeur, the atmosphere of despair, the philosophical undertones, or even the literary beauty of The Iliad.The Odyssey reads almost like a long folk tale, not anepic. Every translation of the Odyssey that I consulted was considerably simpler and less eloquent than the same translator's edition of The Iliad. I had highlighted many similes and beautiful lines in The Iliad, but my highlights in the Odyssey weren't that many at all.Of course, I enjoyed parts of it. The adventures are fun to read and they reverberate interesting details about ancient myths of the Bronze Age Greek-speaking world and its surrounding lands. The parts about Odysseus' adventures (which are, sadly, only a very short section of the poem from books IX to XII, told in a flashback by Odysseus himself) are full of wonder, whimsy, and excitement. I would've enjoyed The Odyssey a lot more if those parts weren't washed over and occupied a larger portion. Everyone praises the mythical creatures and whimsy and wonder in the book but they forget to mention that those interesting creatures are present only in a very short section of the book. The second half only focuses on how Odysseus plans to kill all 118 of his wife's suitors and regain his \"masculine prowess\".Misogyny, Slavery, and the Necessity of Taking Context into Account:This brings me back to my usual problem with ancient texts: I have to shut my whole system of moral judgment (with modern standards) to engage with these stories. This was much easier to do in the Iliad because the setting was a battlefield, and war is never \"nice and moral\", but Odyssey's most violent parts happen in Odysseus' own home, in times of peace, and at least partly out of sheer lust for vengeance (in contrast with the sense of duty in warriors). In this regard, the Odyssey was harder to put up with for me. Every problem I had with the Iliad is present here too, just harder to look past.There's a scene where Telemachushangstwelve slave women (who'd slept with the suitors, thus \"dishonoring\" Odysseus and his family). He says he doesn't want to grant them an easy death by stabbing them, but make them suffer to death. To me, this abhorrent devilry sounds excessive even within the context. Misogyny in the Odyssey is expressed in different ways than the Iliad, but it's still very much present, and it's even more unsettling. Slavery is also a lot more visible and taken for granted in the Odyssey. Even so, I won't make a hassle out of it because of the obvious reason of context. The Odyssey begs to be read, enjoyed, and understood within its ancient, alien context, and I acknowledge that.Intricate DetailsNow, that doesn't mean that I won't give the book the credit it deserves. Many parts of it are interesting, i.e. the delicate attention to detail: Fingers of women weaving carpets are described as \"quick rustling poplar leaves\". The scene where Odysseus suddenly aims his bow at Antinous describes the latter as \"mindlessly twirling the wine in his goblet\", ignorant of what's about to happen. There are many examples of meticulous attention to detail that make the book astonishing.The Gods Are MissingThe less serious downside of the Odyssey is that the gods, comic, irreverent, and hilarious as they are, don't get the well-deserved spotlight they had in The Iliad. Athena is present throughout and we see glimpses of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hermes, but there are none of the stupid bickerings on top of Olympus that gave the Iliad a comical edge. The absence of the dear oldox-eyed Lady Heraand her hilarious scheming is quite unfortunate.The Unreliable NarratorInterestingly, Odysseus is an unreliable narrator. Contrary to what is assumed about ancient heroes, he's not black or white, but a complicated man, \"a man of many ways\" that is capable of bravery, resilience, and love as well as deceit, vengeance and pure evil. His quick wits allow him to lie to everyone and conjure up interesting stories (which are totally false). It looks like most people take it for granted that he's truthful when recounting his adventures, They may as well be fabrications like the rest of his lies. The 'narrator' never testifies for his stories. Hesayshe encountered the Sirens and sea monsters Charybdis and Scylla, but when have we ever seen Odysseus tell the truth?I think this bit about the unreliability of Odysseus makes the whole story a lot more intriguing. The whole story is open to interpretation, you take from it what you will.🔺🔻🔺Notes on TranslationsThere are lots of other interesting themes and details in the Odyssey, but I want to focus on my persistent preoccupation: Translations. I have an obsessive dedication to comparing translations. I enjoyed reading everyone's introduction, translator's notes, and commentaries far more than I enjoyed the actual story.Like what I did with the Iliad, I read the Odyssey from 5 different English translations: two from cover to cover (Fitzgerald & Emily Wilson), most of Lattimore, and consulted the other two only occasionally (Rieu and Fagles). I read everyone's Introductions in full.Disclaimer:I am neither a translator nor a classicist; I don't know Greek, and I am by no means an expert here. I am well aware that \"translation is the art of failure\" and the only way to fully understand a work of literature is to read it in its original. However, I really like comparing translations, because each of them has its merits and shortcomings; I can get a better understanding of the whole book by reading the interpretations and insights of different translators.First, I will quote the same lines from each of these translations so you can get a sense of what they're like. (IV. 561-67)Emily Wilson:\"Gods will carry youoff to the world's end, to Elysium.Those fields are ruled by tawny Rhadamanthusand life is there the easiest for humans.There is no snow, no heavy storms or rain,but Ocean always sends up gentle breezesof Zephyr to refresh the people there.\"Fitzgerald:\"The gods intend you for Elysionwith golden Rhadamanthos at the world's end,where all existence is a dream of ease.Snowfall is never known there, neither longfrost of winter, nor torrential rain,but only mild and lulling airs from Oceanbearing refreshment for the souls of men—the West Wind always blowing.\"Lattimore:\"The immortals will convoy you to the Elysian Field, and the limits of the earth, where fair-haired Rhadamanthysis, and where there is made the easiest life for mortals,for there is no snow, nor much winter there, nor is there everrain, but always the stream of the Ocean sends up breezesof the West Wind blowing briskly for the refreshment of mortals.\"Fagles:\"The deathless ones will sweep you off to the world's end,the Elysian Fields, where gold-haired Rhadamanthys waits,where life glides on in immortal ease for mortal man;no snow, no winter onslaught, never a downpour therebut night and day the Ocean River sends up breezes,singing winds of the West refreshing all mankind.\"Rieu:\"The immortals will send you to the Elysian Fields at the world's end, to join auburn-haired Rhadamanthus in the land where living is made easy for mankind, where no snow falls, no strong winds blow and there is never any rain, but day after day the West Wind's tuneful breeze comes in from the Ocean to refresh its people.\"The Emily Wilson TranslationI will write more about this one because it's the most interesting. Wilson's new (2017) translation (first ever by a woman!) has a magnificent 90-page introduction in which she goes into detail about the history and context of the epic, the origin and making of it, the Homeric question (whether a single person called Homer ever existed or not), the qualities of Homeric verse and epics, its deep roots in traditions of oral performance, the influence of myths and beliefs from inside and outside Greece on these poems, the debates and studies that scholars have focused on, each major character in the story, themes, and the topic of translation itself. Her introduction is so informative and insightful that it deserves five stars on its own.Her comments on translations of Homer throughout the centuries are very interesting. She says that each translation is closely connected with the translator's individual interpretation of the poem, and with the norms of the society in which it was produced. For example, Chapman (1615) presents Odysseus \"as a true soldier and gentleman, a proto-Christian, and proto-Stoic whose greatest virtue is his ability to endure suffering and control his impulses.\" Alexander Pope's 18th-century translation \"makes the Odyssey into a text about those essentially 18th-century preoccupations: proper manners and good government\".Wilson argues that each translation is as much a product of its own time as it is an ancient text. She continues that \"elevated, grandiloquent\" language used is many translations is not accurate: all translations are \"modern\" next to Homer. 18th century English is no closer to Homer than 21st century English is. Therefore, her translation is written in a modern language, which makes it a fast-paced and easy read but also (in my opinion) it takes away some of the charm from it. It reads almost like a 'simplified' synopsis.She also says she's avoided importing contemporary types of sexism into the text. Other translators have used derogatory language (such as calling the slave women \"sluts\") and that this labeling isn't present in the original Greek. Since I can't check the original, I'll take her word for it.She claims to look at the Odyssey through a female lens and she tries hard to make a case for the female characters (specially Penelope). While I appreciate her effort, I still fail to think of the Odyssey as anything but misogynistic. Penelope does not have the agency and assertiveness that Wilson and many others would like to think she has. Trying to force assertiveness on female characters that really are just victimized in a patriarchal context is a bit counterproductive. I'd rather just accept that fact and move on.Overall, I highly recommend this wonderful edition (with emphasis on the amazing intro). Her translation is readable and simple but I would suggest you also take a quick look at one of those more \"elevated\" translations if you enjoy some lyricism and eloquent phrases.The Lattimore TranslationIs the most literary eloquent by far (wich Wilson considers a negative) but I enjoyed reading it a lot because his writing is simply beautiful. It also relatively stays clear of unnecessary sexist or charged language.- It has an introduction in which Lattimore explores main themes, the narrative, and characters, and also compares the Odyssey with the Iliad.- It provides line numbers (from the original) and doesn't miss any details.- It uses the Greek form of the names (i.e. Kirke not Circe).I loved this translation and I definitely recommend it.The Fitzgerald TranslationThis is the one I enjoyed reading the most. Its language is not as elevated as Lattimore; it's still very eloquent and poetic, but in a very readable and fluid way. It doesn't make the poem too difficult or incomprehensive, but I still like the beauty and lyricism that it provides. Its rhythm is more noticeable than Wilson's attempted iambic pentameter, and on a few occasions (whenever Hermes is speaking and the song of the Sirens), it actually rhymes. This one is my preferred edition for reading the actual poem.- It has an afterword in which poetic qualities of the original poem are explored and he tries his best to show how he's tried to stay true to the meaning while also paying a lot of attention to rhythm and lyricism. He provides many lines in Greek (which I couldn't read) and elaborates on his examples.- It uses Greek versions of the names.- Provides a list of further reading and critical texts about Homer, and has a glossary.- The only problem with it is that it doesn't provide line numbers. (not a problem for a casual read, but if you're trying to compare translation, the lack of line numbers gets frustrating.)Still, I definitely recommend it.The Fagles TranslationThis one is easy to read, it's pretty straightforward, but it uses some modern slangs and language that feel a bit out of place. I didn't connect with it that much and it didn't stand out, so I only consulted it on certain interesting phrases.- It has an introduction by Bernard Knox which is almost a repetition of his introduction to the Iliad but it's still interesting.- It uses the more familiar Romanized names (i.e. Telemachus and not Telemakhos)On the plus side:- It provides line numbers, offers maps, genealogy charts, suggestions on further reading, and a pronunciation glossary which are great.The Rieu TranslationThe only prose version that I consulted. It's fine if you like prose. It's easy to understand and straightforward (but I only consulted it occasionally). It uses what Wilson called unnecessary sexist language.- It has a nice and long 40-page introduction in which he explores the history of Homeric poems, reading Homer, problems with the Odyssey, themes and individual characters, and also problems and limitations of translation itself. It has a note on its previous 1964 edition, too.- It uses Romanized names.- Provides original line numbers within the prose (sometimes mid-sentence).- Has maps, many endnotes, and a list of suggestions for further reading (similar to Fagles' suggestions).Final RatingFive stars for everyone's introductions (especially Wilson's), three stars for the story (compared to Iliad whose rating I upgraded to 5), and 3.5 stars as my final rating. I might come back and round it down in the future.In the end, I feel like I enjoyed the introductions and commentary more than the story itself. Even though I still like the Iliad more, I certainly loved immersing myself in the world of the Odyssey and learning a lot from it."

Check out my latestBooktTube Video- all about five fabulous books on female friendship!The Written Review\"Don't try to make me grow up before my time…\"The March sisters may be radically different but they all have one thing in common - love.Their love for their mother and father, their love for adventure and for each other unites themin this troubled time.The Civil War is afoot and all the sisters can do is think about their father away and in battle. Their mother tries to distract them but often she can barely distract herself.Jo,a radical tomboy and aspiring author- rallies her family with her amusing plays and scribbles.I like good strong words that mean something…Meg, the beautiful sister,often puts her family first and holds them together when her mother cannot.You don't need scores of suitors. You need only one… if he's the right one.Amy, the youngest, was spoiled as a child and oh my, it shows. But even she can rally when life looks darkest.I'd rather take coffee than compliments just now.Beth, sweet and good-natured, valiantly cheers on her sisters but her frail health often keeps her at the sidelines.There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping...Thesisters must face hardshipstheir New England home.They must face things that they never would have thought possible.But, even in the darkest of times,they will have each other.And that is most important of all.Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault.This is probablymy fifth or sixth timethrough and yes, I am totally going to read it again.There's just something about this book that'sabsolutelygorgeousandtimeless.I love the sisters and their relationships with each other - I see so much of myself and my cousins with their day-to-day interactions.Jo, the darling, is the perfect mix ofstrength and fear.Watching her grow from a brash girl to confident young woman just makes my heart happy.You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.And the message of the book!Ahh. My heart. So full.It often feels like the messages from books in the mid 1800s aresaccharine sweet or so heavy-handedwith their themes that they're ridiculous. (Just look at the later Anne of Green Gables if you'd like an example!)But this one hadjust the right mixtureof loving family + religion + life lessons. It was beautifully balanced.Be worthy love, and love will come.That being said, I do absolutely hate thatBeth has to die.I swear, every time I reread this series, I practically rediscover that fact (my brain is incredibly good at selective memory-ing those sorts of things)...which makes it awful all the more.Oh, and am I the only one who's still bitter over who Jo ends up with? This book may have been published in 1868but this is my hill and I WILL DIE ON IT!But don't let that spoil your interpretation - this book is truly wonderful. I love it.Audiobook CommentsRead by Kate Reading - can I just take a moment for us all to appreciate the the narrator is Kate Reading?

        "user_review": "Someone I know claimed this no longer has value, that she would never recommend it because it's saccharine, has a religious agenda, and sends a bad message to girls that they should all be little domestic homebodies. I say she's wrong on all counts. This is high on my reread list along with Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, and a Tree Grows in Brooklyn--you could say that I'm pretty familiar with it.Let's see--there's a heroine who not only writes, but is proud of the fact and makes a profit from it in a time that this was somewhat out-of-the-ordinary. Reading this, and especially knowing later that the main character is (for all practical purposes) Alcott herself, inspired me to write myself, and I haven't forgotten the writing lessons even today: don't let money cloud your vision, write for yourself first, take criticism, write what you know. Still wise even today. Also in this book, we see the perspective of a family coping with the financial and emotional strain of having a loved one away at war, something that is unfortunately all too relatable today. There's also (extraordinary in those times, common in ours)a platonic, though not uncomplicated, friendship between a man and a woman that is sort of a different kind of love story in a way and a powerful one at that. We see people getting married, but marriage is never portrayed as The Answer to Everything--many of the matches involve sacrifice and struggling. The girls, though good at heart, aren't a picture-perfect family of saints. They're flawed and human. The paragon Beth would seem the exception, but the message with her is more about how even the quietest among us can make an impact on the world--not parading her isolated life as an example, only her kindness.I won't lie. Someone dies, there's a war and a father's away--so yes, God is mentioned: I think there's a few Pilgrim's Progress references in passing and there's some talk of faith at moments when the characters most need it. To contemporary readers, this may seem like a lot, but heavy-handed it is not. It was probably somewhat unusual for its time. The thought that everyone's relationship and perception of God could greatly vary, and that to be true to your religion was entirely non judgmental and meant being kind to other people and trying to make yourself better, not other people? The thought that each person must be allowed to deal with these feelings in their own time in their own way? Wacky stuff.I admit it seems like a tough sell to today's kids, packaged in somewhat formal sounding-language, and bearing every indication of being literary broccoli, but this book is a classic for a reason. It might be a tough sell, but I don't think we should give up on trying to think of ways to do it anyway. What's inside still counts. Don't write it off.*note* for those of you who liked this review, check out my review of the newThe Little Women Cookbookby Jenne Bergstrom and Miko Osada."

There is nothing more boring to a kid than an antique store. It smelled like dust and old people, and everything looked the same (dark wood), and if we were in a particularly bauble-heavy shop I had to clasp my hands behind my back like a Von Trapp child in order to avoid invoking the you-break-it-you-buy-it policy on a $42 crystal ashtray.On one such excursion, when I was like eight, I found a vintage-ish copy of Little Women. Because it was a book, and because it had some kind of illustration of pretty girls in pretty dresses, it was far and away the most interesting thing in there. So I indulged in what was then and what remains one of my favorite pastimes: asking my mother to buy me something. She said no, both because it was confusingly expensive and because she doubted eight-year-old me's lasting interest in reading a 750-page book from 1868.Ever since, Little Women has tantalized me.I am very pleased to say it lived up to every expectation.This book is so cozy and delightful and happy. A lot of the time, when series start out in the childhood of characters and then follow their growing up, the book gets worse. But I always liked reading about this ragtag group of gals!!Warning, spoiler ahead, and if you complain about me spoiling a book that was published seven of my lifetime ago I will absolutely freak out so don't say I didn't give you a heads up:Obviously Jo and Laurie were meant for each other, and his marrying Amy and Jo's marrying some random old dude was the biggest flaw of this book. But even with that, this book ended happy, and I enjoyed almost every second of it.(Okay, I'm sorry, but Amy is the clear weak link and didn't deserve Laurie!! I will not rejoice for them!!) (Did I have to take off a half star for that alone? Yes. Because it upset me immensely. And I won't apologize. If anyone should be apologized to, it's ME. And also JO. And also LAURIE!)But absolutely every other second was a pleasure.Bottom line: This book feels like Christmas.---------pre-reviewcozy: ✓comforted: ✓joy: ✓review to come!!!---------currently-reading updatesI am ready to feel COZY. I am ready to feel COMFORTED. I am ready to feel JOY."

I AM a grown-ass man reading this, but I'm not even remotely ashamed.What I tried to do here was dispel the extra melodrama & embrace the cut-outs (fat trimmed out) of the Winona Ryder film. I was on the hunt for all the \"new\" (ha!) stuff that the regular person, well informed of the plot involving four young girls growing up (or in the case of Beth, not) never even knew existed. But it seems that the film did a great job not adding many more scenes than direly needed (like the Byrne-Ryder night at the opera scene-- it explains why she doesn't choose Laurie after all) nor taking indispensable scenes from the century-&-a-half old novel to the cutting room floor. Alas, there's a good reason why Entertainment Weekly once decreed that the film was a great comfort to all post-911 victims--a holistic healing to the nation as a whole. The story has no great battles to speak of... no violence, no terrible disasters. The minutiae is symbolic of fragile domestic existences... important & very fun to read about--this coming from a Bridget and Carrie Bradshaw fan of course. \"Little Women\" is at its core all about Old School American values, such as temperance, forgiveness, hard work. It has astute lessons aplenty--to rival even old Aesopus himself. Laurie and Amy have the best lines, & there are plenty of groans amidst cute vignettes and harsh but necessary life lessons--for Americans and non alike. This is relevant today, more so than \"On the Road\" or other so called \"quintessential American classics\"--& that's a genuine plus.This one stands as outstanding soap opera theatrics woven intelligently with American history herself. Good stuff, like a wise mentor of American Lit would say. Also, mega appropriate for the season!(2014)"

        "user_review": "I hated this book.I can't even begin to go into all the reasons I dislike this novel. It's dull and preachy through out most of it--aside from Jo who is a truly inspired character. But everyone else seems one note, most of the chapters come off as morality plays than solid scenes or plots. And just when Miss Alcott has something seemingly interesting she breaks it for no other reason than to do something.Whether its the pairing of Amy and Laurie (huh?), the point made CONSTANTLY that Beth's life isn't useless because she is an angel and showed them that angels do exist and is a total Mary Sue(Really? Cause I'm glad she died before I died of boredom), the forced pairing of Jo and the Professor (Why? I mean--really... Just keep her single) there is also the message that pursing art is selfish. (Jo giving up her writing, Laurie gives up his music, Amy gives up her sketching...)It's not a message I expected--this book is always lauded as one that has inspired countless girls... To do what? Because outside of Jo's sipirt I dont really see much to aspire to in this tsory? The overall message seems to be that as a good Christian one should sacrifice being an artist, being in love with who you want and any hope of independence...It's not because I'm from the modern era that I dislike this book. (Or that I'm an adult reading it.) If you look at other works being done in the same time period you will see that there were stories with less moralizing being done--including by Miss Alcott herself. I was just really disappointed"

        "user_review": "The two books that I have read the most in my life: Little Women and Walden.Louisa May Alcott wrote Little Women in 1868. It centers on the 4 young March sisters: Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. Each of the sisters has a distinct personality. Meg is the oldest, Jo is the writer and tomboy, Amy is the vain one, and Beth is a saint. The sisters are guided by their mother, Marmee, and they strike up a friendship with the next-door-neighbor boy, Laurie.Little Women follows the March sisters as they grow up. Each chapter is relatively short and usually features a moral lesson without being preachy (much like parables in the Bible).TranscendentalismNow, I mentioned Walden. What in the world does that have to do with Little Women? Why I am so glad you asked (or if you didn't I will tell you anyways).Walden is authored by a man named Henry David Thoreau. He also lived in Concord, Massachusetts, the same as Louisa May Alcott. Additionally, Thoreau and Louisa May Alcott were friends. They were both transcendentalists. Transcendentalism is centered around the philosophy of simple, plain living with high thinking.When was the last time you received an advertisement that said, \"Buy less!\" or \"Stop buying things. You are enough!\"? If you are like me, that has never happened. Yet every day, we are inundated to buy more concealer, a new pair of skinny jeans, a lavish vacation, or a gigantic mansion that will surely make us happy. Transcendentalism is anti-consumerism. It is a reminder that there is another way to live.Little Women is the more digestible version of Walden, but if you loved Little Women and enjoyed the morals therein, I highly, highly, highly suggest Walden (alright I suggest Walden to practically anybody).Jane AustenThe last time I read Little Women was before the internet existed. When I picked this book up again for this reread, I am a completely different reader, and I have even more respect for Louisa May Alcott than before. One of the things that I simply hate about Jane Austen is that her characters just seem to sit around and do nothing but complain about men and their highest desire is to be married (the female characters also do a bunch of silly things).Louisa May Alcott is the opposite of Jane Austen, and I like her more for it. Her female characters are strong. At the beginning of the novel, both Meg and Jo are working jobs to support their family. Jo dreams more of being a writer than getting married. Marmee is more focused on raising wonderful people versus marrying off her daughters.One of the characters in Little Women refuses a marriage proposal. When she says no, she says that she really means no. In Jane Austen's novels, her heroine receives multiple marriage proposals, and she says no and then yes. This is very confusing to young readers. Are you supposed to say no when you really mean yes? I think Louisa May Alcott has the better idea of just saying no when you mean no. As an introvert if I get even an inkling that the other person isn't interested, I will never try again so if you mean yes, you should probably say yes and leave mind games to Jane Austen novels.Overall, Little Women is a timeless classic, one that should be read over and over again.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones's DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

        "user_review": "Some books read like a lifelong friendship, each page a warm or comforting embrace as you laugh and weep along with the characters.Little Womenby L.M. Alcott is an enduring and endearing classic that will nestle its way so deep into your heart that you'll wonder if the sound of turning pages has become your new heartbeat in your chest. To read the novel is a magical experience, and we are all like Laurie peering in through the March's window and relishing in the warmth within. I have long loved the film adaptations and make it a holiday tradition to ensure I at least watch it every December (it has Christmas in it, it counts), so it was fascinating to finally read the actual novel and return to character I feel I've always known yet still find it fresh and even more lovely than ever before. Semi-autobiographical, Alcott traces the lives of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and their struggles to make their own way in a society that offers little use for women beyond the household. An emotional epic and moving family saga full of strong characters, sharp criticisms on society and gender roles, and a beautiful plea to dispense with the worship of wealth and find true purpose and value in simplicity, nature and generosity.'I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen.'Little Womenwill leave your heart full and your pen dry from underlining the seemingly endless lovely passages. I'd like to thankAdira and her wonderful reviewfor convincing me to finally actually read this and not just watch the movie again (I did last night though, because who doesn't want to relive the joy of yelling \"Bob Odenkirk?!\" in a theater and later sobbing) because, just when I thought I couldn't love this story more, now I'm fully engulfed by it. Surely enough has been written about this book already, but i like to ramble about things I love so here's a more I guess (I'll try to keep it shorter than usual [having finished writing it now, I failed]). But how can you not be with such incredible characters? Jo is of course the favorite, but I think part of loving this book is wanting to be Jo and realizing you are Amy, but each character touches your heart in their own way. Mr. Laurence and Beth's connection with the piano and lost daughters makes me teary just writing this. Alcott based the story onher real familyand one can read a genuine love for the characters pouring from every page.'Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the world.'Alcott was atranscendentalistand many of her beliefs shine through in the novel. Much of this came from her father and one will be pleased to learn that the real Mr. March—Amos Bronson Alcott—was as radical in his time as his fictional counterpart. An abolitionist who also advocated for women's rights, Amos became a major transcendentalist figure along with his friend,Ralph Waldo Emerson. Alcott's mother was equally radical for her time too, and many of their teachings arrive here through Mrs. March to her children. There is, of course, the belief in nature as the ideal, such as when the March girls, having little jewelry, adorn themselves in flowers instead. Even Laurie states 'I don't like fuss and feathers,' another instance of a return to simplicity over flashy status symbols. There is also the belief in generosity, which is seen throughout with the March family always involved in helping others, and the belief that hard work is important, but not for profit reasons but because it leads to spiritual and emotional happiness and freedom.'Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again; for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for every one; it keeps us from ennui and mischief; is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion.'Towards the start of the novel, the mother advises the children to be like Christian fromJohn Bunyan's allegorical novelThe Pilgrim's Progressand we can see howLittle Womenfollows a similar fashion ofPilgrim'sbeing knowledge gained through the travel of a life lived, and each daughter is shown to face certain trials and must learn to bear their burdens, like Jo's anger, Amy's desire to be liked, Meg's desire for vanity, Beth's passivity. But the largest burdens here are those of love and labor.'Women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they've got ambition, and they've got talent, as well as just beauty. I'm so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for.'The relationship to work is threaded through the entire novel. We have Jo and Amy who wish to be great and break from the traditional mold for women in society. Jo wants to be a writer, though she only publishes scandalous stories under a false name, and Amy desires to be a painter. And neither will settle for anything less than greatness 'because talent isn't genius,Amy states, 'and no amount of energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing.' Meg and Beth, on the other hand, show different routes a woman can take. The novel questions if women can find happiness outside marriage and caring for a household, and these struggles bash against social expectations along the way.'I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be rough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else.''I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy,' Jo quips, and a major part ofLittle Womenis a critique of gender roles and how they stifle people in society. Laurie is an excellent foil to Jo, in many ways, but is also a way that Alcott addresses and subverts gender expectations. Jo and Laurie both use shortened versions of their name that seem to cross gender expectations (even though Laurie didn't like being called Dora) and in many ways Jo tends to represent more masculine behavior while Laurie often a more feminine role. While Meg dresses in finery and tries to fill the traditional role of a woman, Jo prefers to romp in nature in simple or dirty garments and behave, by her own admission, like a boy.Recently there has been a lot of discussion on the author's gender and sexuality, with even the New York Times writingan opinion piecewondering if Alcott or Jo was a trans man. I know that frustrates some people but personally I find it interesting to think about, even if a bit anachronistic, but it seems to be a genuine question people investigate about authors who subvert gender expectations (think how often it was avoided to discussVirginia Woolf's sexuality in the past and now we have letters and look at scenes in Mrs Dalloway and think \"oh yea, that makes total sense\"). Honestly, I say Jo is whatever you want Jo to be. Trans, lesbian, ace, or just a girl pushing back on gender norms. I think the key detail is that Jo was breaking out of the mold, so let that empower you as you best see fit. Personally I thought the marriage to Friedrich felt tacked on anyways (I enjoy the way the Gerwig adaptation addresses this) but, side note, I do see how Alcott weaves in the transcendentalist notion of the \"universal family\" and belief in learning about and supporting other cultures here. Friedrich is German, Meg marries the English John, and Laurie is said to be half-Italian, which all comes as a rebuttal to the anti-immigration sentiments of the times.'I like good strong words that mean something,' Jo says and that appeals to my love of language as well. This book deals with love in many ways, but feels like a romance between book and reader as you enjoy every page.Little Womenwas ahead of its time and still stands proudly today as an endearing work that dares challenge social convention. But most importantly, it feels like a friend. Finishing is hard as now I'll miss the days with the March sisters, and I find books that take you from childhood to adulthood often hit the hardest because you feel as if you've grown up together. An emotional read, also a genius one,Little Womenis a favorite now forever.5/5'Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault.'"

        "user_review": "The book begins:\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents, grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.It's so dreadful to be poor! sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all, added little Amy, with an injured sniff.We've got Father and Mother, and each other, said Beth contentedly from her corner.\"There's an undercurrent of anger in this book and I think Louisa May Alcott would have gone much further with it if her publisher had allowed it and if it weren't a children's book.Louisa herself was fiercely independent and didn't marry. Of course, Jo, her doppelganger and the heroine of the book, did marry. I think the struggle for girls and women to be themselves while following convention is an experience that resonates today. I also think that, ironically, when people today want to return to the simple life, they all forget that there was no simple life. Although youngest sister Amy carries her books to school, writes with an inkwell and fights over pickled limes, her father is fighting a real war fought for ideology and national unity. Martha Stewart has us searching for the \"good things\" and harkening back to garden bounties but nineteenth century girls and women were nearly bound to the home.Young boys and girls might find the domesticity in the book offputting but it was necessary for people to have domestic skills or they could not survive. The working poor in the 1860s, like the working poor today, could not afford maids. Louisa May Alcott's family occasionally made money from making and mending clothing just to get by. I think there was just as much screaming as crying going on in the Alcott household, but Louisa tones things down for the March family.The March family and the sisters made me yearn for my own sisters which never materialized. I also realized that wanting to draw, paint, play music, perform plays and write were interests that I shared with people of another time period. The book itself was written after the Civil War and has a purposeful nostalgic tone.Jo scribbles in the attic and relishes the time she has to write but she is expected to work as a caretaker for her elderly aunt. None of these girls are independently wealthy and the poverty that Alcott writes about in the book mirrors the poverty of her own life but she softens the reality for her fiction. Alcott's father Amos Bronson Alcott was not a soldier, yet he was often away from home. He was a dynamic lecturer and a revolutionary educator who was disillusioned by public reaction to some of his innovations and was often jobless.While a good portion of white northerners were against slavery and wanted more rights for black Americans, they did not go as far as the Alcotts did in their support. I wish that she had written more about their anti-slavery positions.It's also not widely known that Bronson Alcott was shunned for educating black students.Reading Little Women in fourth grade caused me to work as a historical interpreter at the Orchard House for six years many years later. I visited Fruitlands, the Old Manse, the Wayside and the House of the Seven Gables. I studied transcendentalism and learned about the contributions of Elizabeth Peabody and other great female intellectuals of the nineteenth century. I was forever changed after reading the book and I've reread it too many times to count.Louisa was a master marketer akin to J.K. Rowling. She also had a strong survival instinct like Rowling. She desperately needed to make money and writing was her one marketable skill. Notably, she was able to write the book under her own name and not use a gender neutral pseudonym.The book is written for a younger audience and older readers reading it for the first time might not feel a connection with the book because all Victorian children's books were infused with a heavy dose of morality. Girls especially have always been told to endure hardships while remaining happy. My grandmother Ethel, who grew up in the 1930s, told me her mother said to her: \"It's easy to be happy when life rolls along like a song. But it's the girl who's worthwhile who will smile when everything goes wrong.\""

It's a lovely story, and I wonder how I would have felt about it, had I read it when I was younger. Like so many readers, Jo, the lover of books, the writer, is my favorite, a woman before her time, exhibiting independence and a desire for more in her life. It's a coming of age story in so many ways as we see Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy develop over the years, each realizing their flaws and wanting to be better as they become women. They are guided by their mother, Marmee, who raises them alone for a a while during hard times while her husband is off doing his part in the Civil War. Had I read this years ago, I'm not sure I would have been as perceptive to the other things this story depicts - the societal norms of the time and the time itself, during and after the Civil War. Overall, even though it felt a bit old fashioned given when it was written and the time frame it covers, there are universal and timeless messages about the bonds of family, morality and love. It was an uplifting story that I'm glad I finally got to. I'm looking forward to the upcoming movie. I just couldn't see it without having read the book."

OH MY GOD, THIS WAS THE MOST SACCHARINE SWEET, INTOLERABLE TWADDLE I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF READING.All four of the girls are so ridiculously perfect that even when they make the tiny little mistakes that are painted as monumental fuck ups in the book, they're instantly fixed with a sweet smile or a sermon from their mother about women needing to control their anger, or remembering how NICE it is to be poor.As the girls get older, they become slightly less insufferable but I gave zero fucks about any of their romantic relationships and I just wantedBeth to hurry up and die because she was so perfect and so insufferable and I kind of wanted to punch her in the face.So. This is really a one star book that gets an extra star because Jo was actually a half way decent character most of the time and up until a certain point in the story, I had a very nice asexual Jo March headcanon going on."

        "user_review": "To me this book is just a big neon highlighted literary exclamation mark defining how incredibly different I am from my mother. She loves this book. Really, really loves it....a lot. She always used to tell me how great she thought it was although, as a kid I somehow avoided reading it; mainly because at this point I was too busy dangling from a climbing frame by my ankles or stealing scrap wood from building sites in order to make dens and tree houses.As it is prominently placed on the 1001 books list I thought, \"What the hell I'll give it a go\". Man oh man what an epic snooze fest. Less than twenty pages in I could feel my mind slowly shutting down. Was it through boredom? Or was I entering a diabetic coma because of the saccharine overload created by the sickly sweet world of Margaret, Jo, Beth and Amy? Anyway to avoid succumbing to said coma I threw the book as far away from me as I could and then chucked a blanket over it to ensure that I wouldn't be effected by the mind numbing dullness being exuded from between the covers.I know that I risk howls of outrage at this lambasting of a much loved classic but this ticked no boxes for me. I am clearly dead inside."

        "user_review": "\"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burnt hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight slippers, that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.\"– Jo MarchWhether you like this book or not, I doubt there are many that would deny that Jo March is the star of this mid-nineteenth century novel about the March family. In many ways, because of this remarkably self-assured heroine,Little Womenseemed to me much ahead of its time. Sisters Meg, Beth and Amy all have their moments to shine; while Mr. and Mrs. March are more broad-minded than what I imagine their contemporaries to have been. Had I been required to plant myself down in the midst of an American family during that era, I would have been satisfied to settle in with the Marches.Meg yearns for the fine things she once had before poverty knocked the Marches down a few notches; yet she retains a mother-like quality that warmed me to her. Beth is quiet, good-natured and pious; all her sisters look to her as the epitome of virtue. The artistic little Amy is spoiled and vain and dreams of someday becoming a moneyed gentlewoman. I admit to feeling a bit sorry for her and by book's end I became a fan. People do grow up after all, don't they?!And then there is Jo who adores books and dreams of someday becoming a writer. Described as a bit of a \"tomboy\", which I suppose a girl with her pluck would have been commonly labeled back in the day, Jo is at the center of the novel. Given thatLittle Womenis somewhat autobiographical in nature, it is fascinating to read of this spirited young woman. I can just imagine how she felt – stifled by society's norms and expectations of a Victorian 'lady'. She wanted the freedom to express herself; she would often have difficulty suppressing the pent-up rage that she felt deep inside; and she wanted to do what made her happiest.\"An old maid – that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps…\"She shared her hopes with Laurie, the boy next door and her greatest pal besides her dear sisters. They shared a love of literature and the outdoors and confided in one another their greatest dreams.\"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could live in them?\"I read this story as a young teen and didn't recall much of the plot. I have always carried a strong, positive image of Jo in my head during the intervening years; and I'm very glad I decided to reacquaint myself with her and the entire March family. I'm happy to say the image held up. With the exception of ever-sweet Beth, I would say that all of the girls exhibited growth throughout the book, and it was fun to spend some time with them. At times the story felt a bit over-sentimental, but I believe it was aimed at young women and given the date of publication, I decided to forgive it for this small 'crime.' I'm all for a sweet from time to time, as long as it's balanced out with something nutritious, and I believe I got both here. I am super-excited to see the upcoming screen version of this to be released on Christmas Day!\"Now and then, in this work-a-day world, things do happen in the delightful story-book fashion, and what a comfort that is.\""

        "user_review": "Relentlessly captivating story of sisters doing it for themselves. Alcott is a master of character, pacing, and creating page-turning suspense within a context of moderately low stakes. I admire everything about her, from her writing talent to her personal life as an abolitionist and feminist. Much of her personal advocacy makes it into the pages of Little Women. Sometimes in subtle ways, and sometimes not. I'm glad to see that the new movie appears to spotlight the feminist undertones because its groundbreaking depth is easily hidden behind a wall of nonstop entertainment.A true landmark of American literature, everyone should have this on their list of must-read classics. And for audiobook fans, Barbara Caruso's unabridged performance is one of the best of all time.PS: Don't stop here! Alcott's bibliography is full of expertly-written tales. Including some horror and supernatural. I'm a huge fan of her 1866 Gothic novel A Long Fatal Love Chase, which launches into action with the heroine willing to sell her soul to Satan \"for a year of freedom.\""

        "user_review": "I wanted to reread this story since another movie has been recently released based on this book, and also because I forgot what it was about since I read it in 1972. I began rereading my old copy that I bought when I was in Grade 4, and after comparing it with the ebook version my daughter was reading, I realized that my modern abridged edition, published in 1955, was pretty much cut in half, with only 283 pages. Several phrases, sentences, paragraphs and even whole chapters were omitted! Therefore, I purchased the latest edition (published 2019 with a cover depicting the actresses from the latest movie). Needless to say, a lot of questions were now answered!Overall, one has to be mindful that this story was first published in 1868 (over 150 years ago), so language, thoughts, mores and behaviors were quite different then than they are today. I suppose readers back then would have found this book to be quite forward-thinking. As for myself, I found this book to be, in a word, charming. Even the \"sex scene\" between Meg and John was alluded to with such delicacy that you could miss it if you weren't paying close attention. And even though I remembered that Beth dies, I still had tears in my eyes while reading the touching prose describing her death.If you are interested in reading classic literature, put this book on your \"To Read\" list!"

        "user_review": "This is a classic that has never appealed from the title, cover and few reviews I have read of it over the years. A story a year in the lives of the four March sisters, the oldest being 16 and the youngest being 12 told in a style. A bildungsroman loosely based on the lives of the writer and her three sisters with numerous nods to and references to John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The work is seen as more or less the seminal Young Adult book as being pretty much the first to merge sentimental and romantic themes into a work for children. It was a roaring commercial and critical success from the off!On completing this book I read a number of online reviews and was not surprised to find out that it is generally accepted that this depicts an idealised version of Alcott's youth and is actually seen as one of the core roots of the idea of an 'all-American girl'. The book does have an almost fairy tale like feel, but the writer still manages to build some impressive characterisations as well as lots of pulling of heartstrings. In the context of when it was written, it's overall pleasing message which although likening domesticity and the search for true love as core goals for young women , also has surprisingly strong pro-woman themes set around the strength of the mother and sense of the power and importance of female/sister kinship it's well worth the 7 out of 12, Three Stars I give it :)2022 read"

But all the wrong sights, not the sights you want to see.\"So this was my first time reading\"The Outsiders\"and I really don't get why our teachers never forced us to readTHISbook at school! I'm convinced my teenage me wouldn't only have approved but also would have enjoyed it immensely and I'm kinda sad I had to discover this book so late. Well, my school system obviously failed but that definitely didn't stop me from reading\"The Outsiders\"and I'm very glad about it.Soda threw one arm across my neck. He mumbled something drowsily. \"Listen, kiddo, when Darry hollers at you … he doesn't mean nothin'. He's just got more worries than somebody his age ought to.\"I swear the moment I read about the interactions and relationships between those boys I was already hooked! It felt like reading \"The Raven Boys\" all over again; just a couple of years earlier, with other troubles and with a smaller book size. XD I mean alone the fact that Ponyboy and Soda were sleeping together in a bed! Their brotherly relationship was so nice to read! Those brothers cared about each other and their friends and they would have done almost everything in order to help them! <3He was stroking my hair and I could hear the sobs racking him as he fought to keep back the tears. \"Oh, Pony, I thought we'd lost you … like we did Mom and Dad …\" That was his silent fear then – of losing another person he loved.Darry, the oldest of those three brothers, broke my heart as well. I mean their parents were dead and he had to look after his two younger brothers. I can't even imagine how much strength it takes to take care of your brothers at such a young age, but he still did it and was even successful. He got a job and looked after them and this alone makes him a hero in my eyes. Who knows; if Johnny and Dallas would have had such family ties they probably would have never even ended up where they did in the end. >_< Johnny… that poor little boy! He didn't deserve what happened to him and it's no wonder he was so jumpy after the\"Socs\"almost beat him to death. I'm right there with Ponyboy when he says that it's not fair that they were jumped for being\"Greasers\".It wasn't fair for the Socs to have everything. We were as good as they were; it wasn't our fault we were greasers. I couldn't just take it or leave it, like Two-Bit, or ignore it and love life anyway, like Sodapop, or harden myself beyond caring, like Dally, or actually enjoy it, like Tim Shepard. I felt the tension growing inside of me and I knew something had to happen or I would explode. \"The interesting thing about this book is that it acknowledges the fact that the \"Socs\" fight the \"Greasers\" because they think they are lowlives, but that none of those two parties actually wants to do anything against it. They accept this injustice, it's just a part of their life and they all act like they are supposed to fight because it's only natural. The only three people who truly question their situation are Pony, Johnny and Randy. In one way or the other they are all tired of fighting and try their best to get out of that vicious cycle – some more effective than others. >_<\"Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold …\"Oh my, that line killed me big time! T_T I had a lot of mixed feelings about that ending and I could relate to Ponyboy so much. He was confused, he knew what they had been doing wasn't right, that the fighting didn't get them anywhere; that his friend was in trouble because he had done something right and something awfully wrong and that sooner or later he would have to pay for it. I think this book is such a damn good example for humanity. It points out that good people are able to do horrible things and that seemingly bad people aren't always as bad as they seem to appear. They have their problems and troubles too and there is always a reason why they leash out at others, why they act in a certain way.\"We're all we've got left. We ought to be able to stick together against everything. If we don't have each other we don't have anything. If you don't have anything, you end up like Dallas …\"They are all human, whether it are \"Socs\" or \"Greasers\", they all just want to live their lives, they want to be happy and accepted for who they are and in the end they actually aren't as different as they seem to be. It's an epiphany us readers experience while we read this book, but it's a lesson not all of the characters learn. >_<To say it with Martin Luther King Jr. words:\"Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness.\"And I think this quote describes the book more than just well. The ending made me sad, because there's only one way this could have ended and it was exactly the way I expected it to be. Not all of it, but most of it anyway.Conclusion:If you haven't read\"The Outsiders\"yet, you definitely should give it a try! It's a great book which teaches an important lesson and I can recommend it to everyone. This book will make you think and feel and it will continue to do so even after you finished reading the last page. ;-)"

(and i knowcatcherwasn't specifically produced for a teen audience, but it is on the damn syllabus and if it makes you happier, i will call this \"the teen in literature\" instead)in the fifties and sixties, there was seemingly more free-floating apprehension and fear: the a-bomb, the draft, various factors contributed to this fear of an imminent death beyond anyone's control. all this anxiety and fear of the establishment created a more pronounced sense of \"us\" and \"them\" that i think i blabbed on a little in the pigman review, but children were just treated like smaller adults, really. and the literature reflects this. all of these books seem to emphasize a value placed on the preservation of childhood innocence - staying gold, protecting a younger sister from the taint of phoniness, encouraging kids to act like kids and roller skate through the house and disregard the parental restrictions in this one safe place...now, the boundaries are blurrier - girls are getting their periods at 8, and grown men in suits are playing video games on the subway. the distinctions are less clear. and a lot of teen fiction today is more escapist in nature, less didactic. teens don't need to be told to value their childhood anymore because, don't worry, it will never end.peter pan FTW!!this all means nothing, except it is something i noticed. sorry for blabbing on...come to my blog!"

        "user_review": "I have watched this movie over and over when I was younger and I still have it today and love it just as much. I will admit I was in love with Dallas and had a crush on Sodapop but Dallas was my man =)I just can't believe it took me this many years to read the book! And the book was so close to the movie it is almost unreal. Maybe it was due to the fact that S.E. Hinton was on set helping with the movie, I really don't know. I just love that I can read a book and watch a movie and there not be that many things different.Ok, there will be . . . .This is a remarkable story of people from different sides of the tracks. The greasers (the poor boys and some girls) and the socs (the rich kids)This story is told from the greasers side which is awesome because I really don't care about the socs!These boys all looked out for each other in the best ways they could. Even if they were dirt poor, they did what they could for each other.They had fun times getting in rumbles with the socs, most all of them loved to fight. It was like getting set loose in a candy store.Most of the beginning of the story revolves around Ponyboy and Johnny. They are the best of friends and poor Johnny seems to have it bad no matter which way he turns. His parents treat him bad, he sleeps outside most of the time and he got a very bad beating from the socs. That's what they do, cruise around and find a greaser or two alone and gang up on them. They damn near beat Johnny to death and all of the other friends always rally around him and try to protect him from things.Until one tragic night Ponyboy and Johnny get attacked by a group of socs AGAIN, but this time Johnny stabs and kills the jerk that beat him so bad before. They were trying to drown Ponyboy. They have to run to Dallas to help get them out of town. Because that's what friends do, they hang out and help each other if they are in trouble.Dallas tells Ponyboy and Johnny to hop on this train and go to a town and stay in an abandoned church until things die down and he would come up there. He gives them money and a gun. Johnny buys them food and hair dye for Ponyboy (which he hates) and he also gets \"Gone With The Wind\" for Ponyboy because he has always wanted to read it. I thought that was so nice of him and he picked a really great book. Ponyboy spent time reading the book to his friend when they weren't playing cards to pass the time.At one point Dallas shows up and tells them some things and takes them out to eat. The boys decide they are going to turn themselves in but when they get back to the church, it's on fire and there are a couple of people and a bunch of children huddled around it. When the boys get there they find out some of the kids are inside and Ponyboy and Johnny (being the good guys that they are) go in after them. Of course Dallas is yelling for them to get back out!Needless to say they get the kids to safety but Dallas and Ponyboy get a little hurt in the process. Johnny gets messed up bad. It's always Johnny! He always just wanted to be normal for shite's sake! The people thought they were heroes which is truly what they were.\"We think the towheaded kid is going to be all right. He burned one arm pretty badly, though, trying to drag the other kid out the window. Johnny, well I don't know about him. A piece of timber caught him across the back--he might have a broken back, and he was burned pretty severely. He passed out before he got out the window. They're giving him plasma now.\" He must have seen the look on my face because he hurriedly changed the subject. \"I swear, you three are the bravest kids I've seen in a long time. First you and the black-haired kid climbing in that window, and then the tough-looking kid going back to save him. Mrs. O'Briant and I think you were sent straight from heaven. Or are you just professional heroes or something?\"Sent from heaven? Had he gotten a good look at Dallas? \"No, we're greasers,\" I said. I was too worried and scared to appreciate the fact that he was trying to be funny.Johnny isn't doing so well in the hospital and Dallas and Ponyboy are really afraid for him.Dallas breaks out of the hospital on the night of the rumble to fight for Johnny. He was so happy after the fight that he grabbed Ponyboy and rushed back to the hospital to tell Johnny they had won. Even though, they didn't know it at the time, they got to spend the last few minutes with Johnny before he died. It was so sad, I cried a river. I knew what was going to happen but it doesn't matter, I cried the river.Dallas goes nuts of course and runs off. Ponyboy is in a daze when he gets home and tells everyone that Johnny is dead and that Dallas ran off. They are all sad of course and worried what Dallas is going to do. And then they get the call that Dallas robbed a store and the police are after him so they go to meet up with him. But when they get to him the stupid cops killed him. And I think he wanted that really because he pulled an unloaded gun on them. Maybe it's just my thoughts but I feel like he called the guys because he did want to live in a way but he was so messed up with Johnny dying after all that poor kid had been through, that he wanted to die himself. Of course I cried and cried at that as well.So, Ponyboy is trying to cope with two of his friends dying in one night. He doesn't do very well and is sick for quite some time.This book really made me have some feels. Like I said before I have watched the movie a million times but as an adult, reading the book put more things into perspective. This is the second book that I have read lately that has made me want to change some things in my life. At least some of the things that I can and that is one of the many things I love about reading. ♥MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading ListRead 2016 * 2018"

        "user_review": "Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold.***********The Outsiders is a book about sensitive teenage boys who alternately get into gang fights, hug one another, and burst into tears. They also spend more time than you might expect ruminating on how the tightness of a t-shirt might enhance the rippling musculature of a steely-eyed fellow gang member (this is where Stephanie Meyer got the idea for how to characterize Edward). Even though they're always complimenting each other's hair and doing gymnastics, it's not gay at all because it takes place in 1965, shortly after James Dean had made crying and homoerotic tension cool.This is the kind of book that teachers like to assign to 7th graders (or dumb high schoolers) because it offers up a lot of THEMES about how EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT BUT STILL THE SAME, and teachers feel pretty safe giving a quiz on that because even the stupidest kid can figure it out, as every few paragraphs the narrator will just go ahead and state it outright, like this: \"Even though we're Greasers and they're Socs, I guess in the end, we all look at the same sunset.\" (Sample essay question: What did Ponyboy mean when he said that everyone looked at the same sunset? And all you have to do to get it right is repeat the first half of the sentence.)As a narrator, Ponyboy kept reminding me of Holden Caulfied, if Holden was poor and actually managed to do anything interesting with his evenings. But maybe that just has to do with the time period and the fact that they both say stuff like \"I was just about bawling my eyes out, to tell you the truth\" every few pages, except Ponyboy is doing it because his best friend knifed someone and then died of a broken back and being on fire, and Holden is just sad because his roommate smells bad (oh and I guess his brother got cancer and died pffffft). I do think they would get along if they ever met, and maybe make out a little bit.I love the last few sentences of every chapter, where SE Hinton trots out her corniest stuff. Chapter 7: \"Socs were just guys after all. Things were rough all over, but it was better that way. That way you could tell the other guy was human too.\" Chapter 8: \"'Thanks, Ponyboy.' She smiled through her tears. 'You dig okay.' She had green eyes. I went on, walking home slowly.\" Oh and it doesn't come at the end of a chapter but: \"Not even the rattling of the train could keep me awake, and I went to sleep in a hoodlum's jacket, with a gun lying next to my hand.\" There's also the best deathbed speech in all of teen literature (probably), which goes like this: \"INTERPRETS THEMATICALLY RELEVANT POEM\" (DIES).So somehow I never read this in middle school, and when I read it now, I just end up giggling at half of the overwrought emotion (which happened with Catcher in the Rye too, but there I'm going to assume Salinger was writing on multiple levels, because he was a competent adult, whereas The Outsiders was written by someone Holden's age). But it's still a pretty awesome book.EDITED to add that this Penguin edition makes the book seem really classy, which is nice, but Jodi Picoult's introduction is kind of a joke. She basically asked her 14-year-old son to write a book report and quoted excerpts.Facebook 30 Day Book Challenge Day 6: Favorite young adult book."

        "user_review": "What book did you just not \"get\"?When I was in tenth grade, I read The Outsiders for the first time. The story was boring, and I didn't connect with the characters.Then, we had the class discussion. Apparently, there was some \"obvious\" symbolism that I had missed. At the time, I thought that this book was like The Da Vinci Code, a mystery where I had missed a key clue. How brilliant this author must be! My regard for this book became almost reverential.Fast forward some years until Lisa becomes \"Lisa of Troy.\" The Outsiders appears on thelist of GoodReads books with 1 million or more ratings. Of course, I am going to read it again!What did I think of it this time? It is still boring, and I didn't connect with any of the characters.The Outsiders has a few key events, and the book should have been shorter. The repetition was ad nauseam. There were many versions of, \"Golly…gee! I act like a thug but I'm just a cuddly teddy bear inside. I wouldn't hurt nobody!\"\"Golly\" is mentioned eight times in The Outsiders, and it isn't even that long of a book.There are also too many different characters. Why would the author name two characters Dally and Darry?

Who?One thing that you can believe is, when your elders say that you don't stay the same, they are correct.They mean that you change the way you think, the way you do things, the way that you look upon the world. I've heard this said so many times that I can dream about it.In other words, I used to adore this book. And I thought Ponyboy was adorable. Of course, I was twelve-years old and had different standards for adoration (maybe).I have to confess, though, I wasn't confused like him. I thought that he should snitch.Still, I give this book four stars. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

It seems like any person, young or old, rich or poor, popular or outcast could empathize or sympathize the themes. Finally, the key climax points are done very well and hit you right in the feels!Another thought I had while reading is this is another one of the young adult fore fathers. We now take for granted that every week there will be 10 new YA titles to pique our interest. Back when this came out, the YA gems were few and far between. Reading this should be a right of passage for YA fans everywhere."

Hinton, first published in 1967 by Viking Press.Ponyboy Curtis, a teenager member of a loose gang of \"greasers\", is leaving a movie theater when he is jumped by \"Socs\", the greasers' rival gang.Several greasers, including Ponyboy's two older brothers—the paternal Darry and the popular Sodapop—come to his rescue.The next night, Ponyboy and two greaser friends, the hardened Dally and the quiet Johnny, meet Cherry and Marcia, a pair of Soc girls, at a drive-in movie theater.Cherry spurns Dally's rude advances, but Ponyboy ends up speaking civilly with Cherry, emotionally connecting with a Soc for the first time in his life. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «حاشیه نشینان»؛ «غیر خودیها»؛ نویسنده اس.ای هینتون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز بیست و پنجم ماه آگوست سال2002میلادیعنوان: حاشیه نشینان؛ نویسنده: اس.ای. هینتون؛ مترجم نجمه فخرایی؛ ت‍ه‍ران‌: ه‍وای‌ ت‍ازه‌، 1380؛ در 175ص؛ شابک 9647222289؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: غیر خودیها؛ نویسنده: اس.ای هینتون؛ مترجم میترا دانشور؛ تهران، انتشارات میلکان، در 184ص؛ شابک 9786008812012؛حاشیه‌ نشینان، در مورد مشکلات زندگی، سه برادر، به نامهای: «دری»، «سودا» و «پونی‌بوی کورتیس»، در برخورد با تضادهای طبقاتی، بین خرپول‌ها، و روغنی‌هاست؛ به باور «پونی‌بوی»، دو جور آدم، در این دنیا وجود دارند: «روغنی‌ها»، و «خرپول‌ها»؛ «خرپول‌ها» پول و پله دارند، هرچه بخواهند بدست می‌آورند، و تکبرشان سر به آسمان می‌ساید؛ از آنسوی دیگر، «روغنی‌ها»، همیشه در حاشیه‌ هستند، و باید هوای پشت‌ سرشان خویش را، داشته باشند؛ «پونی‌بوی» از روغنی‌هاست، و همیشه هم، به این قضیه میبالیده، حتی به خاطر رفقای روغنی‌ خویش، علیه دار و دسته‌ ی خرپول‌ها، شاخ‌ و شانه می‌کشیده ...؛ تا اینکه در شبی وحشتناک، دوستش «جانی»، خرپولی را می‌کشد؛ این آدمکشی، بدجوری حال «پونی‌بوی» را، بد می‌کند، و دنیای دودسته‌ ای ایشان را، زیر و رو می‌نماید، و به او می‌آموزد، چه خرپول باشی، و چه روغنی، رنج، دردی مشترکی است؛ «اس.ای هینتن» این داستان را، در دهه‌ ی شصت سده بیستم میلادی، و در سن پانزده‌ سالگی خویش بنوشته است؛نقل از یادداشت مترجم سرکار خانم «نجمه فخرایی»: (حاشيه‌ نشينان كتاب منتخب معلم انگليسی كلاس هفتم مدرسه‌ ی ما در «تورنتو» بود، اين كتاب پيشنهاد معلمی بود كه من هيچ‌وقت با او كلاسی نداشتم ....)؛ پایان نقل؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 12/12/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 13/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "I'm a little horrified at myself for not having this book up before now. We had a discussion about it in class today, and I had to write this as soon it was over. I wish there were more stars to give The Outsiders, but five will have to do. I love this book, and have loved it faithfully since I read it in sixth grade - I must have read it a dozen times, and possibly more. I can quote long sections of the book. I was obsessed, and to some degree still am.It's not a good book by any literary standard, really. Hinton uses one of those usually awful formulaic introductions that devotes a paragraph to each main character, explicitly describing their characteristics, history, and appearance. When I think of it objectively, it's almost as bad as that awful, awful introductory second chapter of the Babysitters Club books that repeats in every installment.I think the point is, though, that I just don't care. In fact, I adore the writing even though it is obvious. Maybe because I first read it when I was eleven and that sort of writing just seemed clear and to-the-point. At any rate, I don't think it suffers too badly from the style, and if anything it benefits from the authenticity of a teenage author.I can't even begin to say what it was about this book that caught my interest and imagination so completely. I liked the otherness of it - I had never experienced anything like these boys dealt with. Not the pervasive fear and violence, not the absentee, non-existent, or abusive parents, and definitely not the fascinating siege-mentality camaraderie that existed in their group.The best part of the book, without any doubt, is the characters she has created. I love them all, with the exception of Steve. They are wonderful and so sympathetic, with their odd names and ill-fated lives. I hope for the ending to change every time I read it. Ponyboy's voice, which narrates the story, has a beautiful vulnerability and honesty that makes the story believable. He's often confused, hurt, scared, sorry, and just feels like things are wrong; but, he's also brave and kind and takes chances on people. I think that Hinton's allowing her main character to be a real person, who is more often than not unsure of everything he does, gives the book its credibility with teenagers.Fantastic, must-read, childhood-defining book. Reading Hinton's \"That Was Then, This is Now\" is worth it just for the few brief cameos a slightly older Ponyboy makes throughout the story."

        "user_review": "In my review of Rumble Fish I said that I had no intention of reading The Outsiders… and here we are not having had a full year pass and I've read The Outsiders. How did this happen? Well, for one thing I saw the film The Outsiders for the first time and was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. Second I stumbled upon this in a buy two get one free book deal and decided that for free I'd give it a shot.Fine then, I'll read it but I probably won't like it!...Okay, I liked it.Had I not known Rumble Fish was the later work, I would have assumed this was. It's a much more confident and skillfully crafted work. The other was more experimental at times (which I for one applaud) but it felt like occasionally the author didn't know where things were going to go. This is far from the case here. This one feels carefully put together, with a clear intention of start, finish and everything in between. There's a couple of really clever bits of foreshadowing in some of the early lines and a lot of beautifully described scenes. The voice here is confident and appealing.This is even more shocking to me because apparently Hinton started writing this book when she was only 15. The book was published when she was 18. While it is not the greatest written piece of literature in the world, I can imagine very few authors pulling off such a work at such a young age. Especially capturing this much depth in her characters.I won't say I have no intention of reading any more of Hinton's books in the future, at this point it would just be tempting fate to prove me wrong, but for now I am satisfied. 4/5 stars.\"Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold...\""

Said child was forlorn that he would be unable to complete the assignment as the editions of the book were for \"class use only\" and were not permitted to be taken home. \"Never you fear,\" I said to the young boy, \"for I have a LIBRARY CARD!!!!!!\" (while actually freaking out that I might have to: (i) change out of my \"comfy\" clothes, (ii) move my slothlike self off of the sofa after a hard day at work, or (iii) embarrass the child by refusing to change out of P.J. pants whilst chauffeuring him to pick up a hard copy of the book). I asked the small boy (with much trepidation) \"what book do you need?\" and he answered\"The Outsiders.\"I was filled with glee and assured my son I couldeasilyhelp him with any questions about that book as I read it a bunch of times myself 800 years ago when I was a young girl. The boy was dubious, so in order to ease his mind I searched the interwebs and was thrilled to find outThe Outsiderswas available in Kindle format from the library. Whilst waiting for the book to load on to the Kindle, I turned to my son and said the following words:\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight, from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home . . .\"Followed by:\"BLAM! TAKE THAT SUCKA! STILL WANT TO TANGLE WITH THE MEMORY OF THIS OLD LADY? YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO, NOW WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?\"The boy was able to pick my geriatric brain for assistance with his homework and it turned out the book wasn't really a requirement in order to get the assignment done in the first place. (Note to all of you youngsters who do not yet have children of you own – THEY ARE WILEY MOFOS AND EVEN THE MOST HONOR-ROLL-A-RIFIC KID WILL AT SOME POINT GO TO ANY AND ALL LENGTHS TO AVOID HOMEWORK.) Thus, I found myself left withThe Outsiderson the Kindle and it was seriouslybeggingme to put down the crappy book I was currently reading and take a trip down memory lane. So that's just what I did . . .It was just as good as I remembered it.The Outsidersis the quintessential teenage story about love and loss and family and right and wrong and good and bad. I read it in an evening, sitting outside during a sunset, as one should do if given the opportunity. It proved to be timeless, it still made me teary-eyed after all these years, and I still thought it had one of the best ensemble cast of characters ever put to paper.And then I remembered it was written by ateenager- one of those awful things that lives in my house and makes my hair turn gray. So let me wrap up this non-review kind of review with a personal note: To my son, I ask you to recognize everything I do for you is with love, just like Darry Curtis and Ponyboy, and I promise I will do everything in my power to make you \"stay gold\" as long as possible."

This will always be my favorite book and I am see myself reading this another 4 times during this year.I believe this is a book that all ages need to read, it's such a life changer and it shows you have rough people have it. Rich or poor everybody goes through some sort of hell. It teaches you to respect and appreciate where you are brought up and who you are brought up with. Always choose kindness.This book is some what violent, funny yet witty, sad but joyful and most of us important!ADDING TO THIS:i love it way more and Ponyboy speaks to me on a personal level.adding Jan 8th 2020This book is still powerful and I still love it, it's obsessive... the only difference is that I cried until I couldn't breathe. Johnny's letter, Johnny and Dally dying and the whole \"we're all we've got left\" it just made me think about being away from home and all I want to do is quit college, get a simply job and stay at home."

February 2023 is my \"Books For Young and Old Alike\" Month.Praise:The characterization is quite complex in this story. Even though the Greasers come from \"the wrong side of the tracks\", they each have their strengths and their weaknesses. Some question their choices in life. Even some of the rich \"Socs\" are shown in a humane light.Niggle:The plot really fell short for me. Events happened quickly and either ended too conveniently or too abruptly. Some scenarios were head-scratching unbelievable and, at times, emotionless.Overall Thoughts:I was pleasantly surprised to learn that authorS. E. Hintonwrote the majority of this story when she was only 16-years-old! She obviously followed the \"golden rule of writing\" -write what you know and care about.Research shows that children crave structure - they need the adults in their lives to \"parent\" them, not to be their buddies. So as a parent and a teacher myself, I loved the quote when Randy was talking to Ponyboy about his dead friend, Bob's, very lax upbringing:\"That is what he wanted. For somebody to tell him 'No'. To have somebody lay down the law, set the limits, give him something solid to stand on. That's what we all want, really.\"Recommendation?A quick, thoughtful read. Give it a try, if you haven't already."

However, the insurmountable praise forThe Outsidershas always been tough to evade. It's everywhere.I found that the quality of this book was perfectly evidenced by the fact that the immense expectation and build-up accumulated throughout the years were so well met by the actual classic worthiness of the story and the way it was told.Loved the simple, original narrative. Great, real, well-developed, relatable characters.This book is heartwarming and heartbreaking... so prepare your heart for the exercise."

In the end, she decided to write the kind of young adult novel she wanted to read: about real issues, written truthfully and with painful realism.This was a very controversial book in its day: I know my high school did not have it on the curriculum. What an excellent, inspiring novel. I remember how moved I had been when I read Catcher in the Rye (which, oddly enough, despite all the curse words and \"sexy\" situations, was permitted reading in my high school). The characters in The Outsiders seemed like real boys to me.My heart broke for the Curtis brothers, and especially for Darrie, who had to give up his college scholarship so he could keep his brothers together. What a tragic but equally uplifting story.And, by the way, here are the full names of the Curtis brothers: I found this on page 172 of the Penguin Platinum Edition:Darrel Shaynne Curtis, Jr.; Soda Patrick Curtis; Ponyboy Michael CurtisI highly, highly recommend this excellent book: it has everything you could want in a story: likeable characters, great action and rumble sequences, personal growth and realization and a decent realistic ending. It has also stood the test of time. Good job, S.E. Hinton!"

This book was read for school! So in school, we were given 5 books, and had to choose one book to read for a literature study.The choices were:The Hobbit, or There and Back AgainThe Boy in the Striped PajamasCopper SunThe OutsidersThe GiverNow, you might be asking why I chose this book, and that's because I found this book in my recommendations a while back! So, I would like to thankIzzyfor recommending this book to me, I really loved it! <3Now...onto the review:I really loved this book! I did not expect to like it, because, well my school usually doesn't pick good books for us to read. But, I did have higher hopes than usual since thiswasrecommended by Izzy. :) I was not disappointed!Let's start with theplot!PonyBoy, the main character, is a Greaser. They are more like outsiders of their town, having to watch their back against Socs. Socs, or Socials, are the people with the money, and the richer folk who can get away with anything. The Socs and Greasers are at constant battle, always fighting with each other.But, PonyBoy it proud to be a Greaser. Even though his life is rough, he has his family to keep him company. His family consists of his two brothers, Soda and Darry, and some friends considered family, like Steve, Two-Bit, Dally, and Johnny.So life is good, PonyBoy goes to school, and hangs out with the gang. However, everything changes when his friend Johnny, kills a Soc (not a spoiler, it's in the synopsis). Some Socs jump PonyBoy and Johnny, and one of them tries to drown PonyBoy. Johnny then has no choice but to kill him. He never intended to kill, but what's done is done.PonyBoy and Johnny then have to adjust to the criminal life. They run away to a different town, and hide. This is basically half the plot, but Hinton really makes the plot interesting!In the next half of the book, there is a fire in a building, and children are in the building. Johnny, PonyBoy, and Dally (who met them in the church later), go in to save the children. Then, they go from criminals to heroes. So this half of the book is very different, as they are adjusting to their new selves.But, there's a problem. Johnny and Dally? They got injured in the fire, and are now in the hospital. There's no guarantee whether they will survive or not.This worries the crap out of the gang. And many shocking events follow.The plot twists were quite interesting with this one! I was quite shocked whenRandy refused to fight the greasers.It also totally broke my heart whenJohnny died. You see the quote in my review? Those were Johnny's last words.I was literally in tears whenDally killed himself because of Johnny's death.The plot was really good, made me quite emotional. But what made me more emotional was the fact that I could connect to these characters.Let's move onto thecharacters:I really enjoyed the characters! I found that I could connect with some of them, and I love characters whom I can emotionally relate to.PonyBoy:Our main character! PonyBoy is the youngest of his 2 brothers, Soda and Darry. He is a kind guy, not your typical greaser. He enjoys reading and watching sunsets. So you can see why I could connect with him lol. But anyways, PonyBoy grows up with the gang, and is the youngest of the group. I honestly thought being in his head was quite interesting.He thought some pretty deep things. Throughout the book, he talked about books he read, and how they applied to real life. And the way he thought them, it wasn't like reading a textbook. It was actuallyinteresting.Who knew analyzing poetry could be interesting? XDI definitely saw a lot of growth in him throughout the book. In the beginning of the book, he was an uncertain boy who loved to read. Now, our PonyBoy has grown up so much! Look at him, giving wise saying and thinking smart things. He is so much more confident of himself and I'm proud of him!Soda:Soda holds a special place in my heart. He is the middle child of the three brothers. He quit school, because he claims he was too dumb, and works at a gas station.Soda is so supportive, it's very sweet. When PonyBoy was sent to the hospital, he was the first one there. When PonyBoy was in the dark, Soda turned on the light for him. He really helped PonyBoy in a way I found really sweet. This is the definition of the best sibling relationship.Soda definitely grew too! In my opinion he was perfect at the beginning, but at the end, he definitely became more mature and more responsible. Rooting for him!Darry:Darry was...interesting. I didn't like him at first to be honest. He was bossy, and seemed to have something against PonyBoy. Darry is the oldest of the brothers. He could have gone to college, but he left school to get money to support the gang.That sounds great, but he was so harsh to PonyBoy, and clearly favored Soda over him. But, as the story progressed on, he grew on me. I found out that he really did care for PonyBoy, he just did not know how to express it.When PonyBoy was in the hospital, after Soda, Darry was the second one to show up. It was such an emotion scene whenthe two brothers hugged.I could really sense that they finally understood each other.So did Darry grow? Heck yeah! He grew from an emotionless, tough rock to a caring big brother. He definitely changed a lot through the book, and I'm proud of his transformation!Dally:I hated Dally with pure hatred at first as well. He harassed girls, committed crimes, and had a crazy criminal record. He was tough, and nothing got to him. I saw him as kind of evil.But, only at the end, whenDally killed himself,I caught a glimpse of him. He wasn't unbreakable. He wasn't evil. This was just his way of life. The reason hekilled himselfwas because he was in grief.Johnny's deathfinally broke him and that's how he dealt with it.He is now one of my favorite characters, even though he broke my heart. :(Johnny:He also has a special place in my heart! Who am I kidding? All these characters are special! Johnny is considered the \"pet\" of the gang, second youngest to PonyBoy.He had very low self-esteem, because the Socs gave him a really bad beating one day. His parents didn't want him, so his gang was his family. I wouldn't say he was happy like PonyBoy, he really wanted his family to love him.When Johnny killed the Soc, he changed completely. He was scared ofhimself.But, when PonyBoy and Johnny run away together, he definitely grew.When he was caught in the fire and ended up in the hospital, he became more sure of himself, and learned to love himself. Unfortunately,he did not survive. I feel so sad he didn't get a happy ending. He totally deserved it. :(Overall, Johnny was an amazing character, whom I will never forget.To conclude, I really loved the characters! Too bad this isn't a sequel to this book, I would have loved to see more of them! <3Moving on to thewriting!The writing was quite simplistic, but it still holds a special place in my heart. There was a lot of slang, and I honestly appreciated it. A lot of authors make the characters talk so formally, it gets unrealistic. Hinton has the characters talk in a very casual tone, and it had its own charm.I have nothing more to say about the writing, but I really loved it!Overall, I really loved this book. It covered some very deep topics such as empathy, honor, identity, and divided communities. I honestly learned a lot from this book. Really? Who would have ever thought a fiction book couldteachyou something? Believe or not, it did.Thank you S.E. Hinton, this was a masterpiece.-------------------------------------------------------This was absolutely amazing and heart-breaking. Review to come."

        "user_review": "Occasionally a book is written at the perfect time, with the perfect story, with the perfect group of characters; and it is written with a passion and an insight that make it unique, that distinguishes it from any other book and any other story. And sometimes it defines a generation, or a culture or sub-culture of that generation. That, my friends, is what this book does. Is that what 15 year old Susan Eloise Hinton had in mind when she started to write this book? Probably not, but she was affected by what she saw in her 1965 Oklahoma high school; the presence of two rival gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. It inspired her to write a story, their story, and by doing so it resonated across a nation, across a generation, and it became what it is today, a symbol of that generation, and a classic in American literature."

I like how the story was written by a young author who really knew what she was writing about--she based it partly on the experiences of her friends. It's like people say--\"Write what you know.\" And S.E. Hinton did just that, and did an excellent job. The book does have some corny parts, and is one of very few books that actually made me cry. But it's really fantastic, and I think everyone in the whole world should read it! (But don't watch the movie. It's awful.)"

        "user_review": "\"Stay gold, Ponyboy. Stay gold . . .\"The Outsiders is a coming-of-age classic that explores the topics of loss, tragedy, social division, wealth inequality, injustice, and lack of opportunities. I was completely shocked to learn that the author was only 16 years old when the story was written. A story with such deep topics young people are usually oblivious to. Therefore, I highly recommend reading the author's note.I watched the 80s film adaptation of The Outsiders many years ago, and it has always been very memorable. It has an amazing cast! Sometimes it's nice to have seen the movie prior to reading the book because then you picture the actors as the characters as you read. Which is exactly what I experienced while reading!I actually never knew it was based on a book until I joined Goodreads a few years ago. I finally got around to reading it this year. It was a quick read, very hard to put down, and really squeezed some major emotions out of me. I think to truly be able to relate to and understand the depths of the inner pain this book depicts, you have to have been an outsider at one point or another in your lifetime. And I most definitely have been on many occasions.\"I stared at the ceiling. What would it be like, I wondered, staring at a different ceiling? What would it be like in a different bed, in a different room?\" ~ PonyboyThis quote really struck me….What would it really be like for everyone to have equal opportunities and lives that others take for granted? Such as a safe home? A loving family? Money? How would the world be different?So above all, this story is really a story about the injustices of inequality; the fate our society has created and continues to nurture every single day. But it's a phenomenal story and a phenomenal movie. Highly recommend it! But expect to really feel something when you read it.I'll always hold a special place in my heart for Ponyboy, Johnny, Sodapop, Darry, and Dallas….I also loved the book references to Gone With the Wind and Pip from Great Expectations!"

        "user_review": "This book has stood the test of time. The author has the ability to speak to everyone and anyone because of the emotional connectedness it exudes. The story is about youths, you could even say troubled youths. There is a coming-of-age presence in the book with all the characters, not just Ponyboy Curtis. There was a redeeming quality I found in the story because underlying we all have within ourselves something good. I also found that life is and can be difficult, but family can keep anyone grounded. I felt the author also hints at fate and one's perceptions of fate, such as Dally's and Johnny's sad background stories. You could say \"oh, they did it to themselves\" but there are outweighing external factors that left these two characters in pretty crappy situations.I found myself completely engaged during the church fire part and the consequent ambulance ride. The dialogue between Ponyboy and Mr. Jerry seemed so real and natural: \"Mrs. O'Briant and I think you were sent straight from heaven. Or are you just professional heroes or something?\", pg. 95I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. The story, the dialogue, and the emotions are very real.Stay Gold, everybody! Thanks!"

        "user_review": "YOU. ARE. THE. DEAD.Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak \"Double Plus Good.\"Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can't help it. My mind is completely fried.This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings, with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it's almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I'm almost glad I didn't. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it fully.From the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.For instance, he talks about howthe act of writing itself is a type of time travel. It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.The politics and psychology of this novel run deep. The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn't the name of the book. In the story, they don't actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They don't have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston's feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.I wasn't expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I wasn't sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it's at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.Inside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.A common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it wasn't necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, \"Of course, the many is more important than the one\", but when inside Winston's head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace.Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I can't answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world's, and maybe that's part of the problem but it's also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I'm naive for thinking that way, but so be it.I almost don't know what to think about this book. I'm not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It's the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.Everything about this book is captivating. It's groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.Basically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it's all worth it in the end. It's absolutely incredible and I loved it. I don't re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read."

        "user_review": "This book is far from perfect. Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin'sWe, and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face.But in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their \"alternative facts\" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth.If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever.Orwell's vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control.Here, in the USA, in 2017, our would-be totalitarians are a long way from stasis. Right now they're stirring up chaos and confusion, spreading lies and then denying they spread them, hoping to gaslight us into a muddle of helplessness and inactivity. They are trying to destroy a vigorous democracy, and they know it will take much chaos and confusion to bring that democracy down. They hate us most when we march together, when we occupy senate offices and jam the congressional switchboard, when we congregate in pubs and coffee houses and share our outrage and fear, for they know that freedom thrives on solidarity and resistance, and that solidarity and resistance engender love and hope. They much prefer it when we brood in solitude, despairing and alone.Which reminds me...one of the things we shouldneverdo is brood about the enemy's ideology (Is Steve Bannon a Fascist? A Nazi? A Stalinist?), for while we try to discern his \"ideological goals,\" the enemy is busy pulling on his boots, and his boots are made with hobnails, with heel irons, and equipped with toecaps of steel.Finally, it does not matter who heads up the authoritarian state: a bully boy like Mussolini, a strutting coprophiliac like Hitler, a Napoleonic pig like Stalin, or a brainless dancing bear like Trump. Whatever the current incarnation of \"Big Brother\" may be, the goal is always the same:A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face."

        "user_review": "WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I've ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More's version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke inV for Vendettalook like sissies.Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The \"truth\" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society's order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That's describes the first slogan.The second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you'll be indestructible and immortal.Ignorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they'll act \"on behalf of the low\" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.Blimey, Orwell's Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives \"depression\" a new meaning, at least for me."

        "user_review": "In George Orwell's 1984, Winston Smith is an open source developer who writes his code offline because his ISP has installed packet sniffers that are regulated by the government under the Patriot Act. It's really for his own protection, though. From, like, terrorists and DVD pirates and stuff. Like every good American, he drinks Coca-Cola and his processed food has desensitized his palate to all but four flavors: sweet, salty-so-that-you-will-drink-more-coca-cola, sweet, and Cooler Ranch!(tm). His benevolent overlords have provided him with some war happening somewhere for some reason so that he, and the rest of the population, can be sure that the government is really in his best interests. In fact, the news always has some story about Paris Hilton or yet another white girl who has been abducted by some evil bastard who is biologically wired by 200,000 years of human evolution to fuck 12-year-olds, but is socially conditioned to be obsessed with sex, yet also to feel guilty about it. This culminates into a distorted view of sexuality, and results in rape and murder, which both make for very good news topics. This, too, is in Winston's best interests because, while fear is healthy, thinking *too* much about his own mortality is strictly taboo, as it may lead to something dangerously insightful, and he might lose his taste for Coca Cola and breast implants. The television also plays on his fears of the unknown by exaggerating stereotypes of minorities and homosexuals, under the guise of celebrating \"diversity\", but even these images of being ghetto-fabulous and a lisping interior designer actually exist solely to promote racism and homophobia, which also prove to be efficient distractions.For some reason, Winston gets tired of eating recycled Pop Tarts and eating happy pills and pretending to be interested in sports and manufactured news items. But, in the end, they fix him and he's happy again. Or something."

        "user_review": "1984is not a particularly good novel, but it is a very good essay. On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother. These are the successes of1984's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. Like so many immortalized books with a social vision,1984's actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fear-mongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers. If you'd like a better sense of the real world and Orwell's intents, rather than third-hand interpretations of his fiction, then hisHomage to Cataloniais highly recommended."

I was only 12 years old when I first read it but I suddenly saw how politics could be taken and manipulated to tell one hell of a scary and convincing story. I'm a lot more well-read now but, back then, this was a game-changer. I started to think about things differently. I started to think about 2 + 2 = 5 and I wanted to read more books that explored the idea of control."

Ignorance is strength.\"In ravaged post-apocalyptic future, the world has divided itself into three totalitarian superpowers: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. The three superstates always in constant never ending war with each other, and relentlessly and mercilessly purging their own population to align them with their current goals. Winston works in the 'Ministry of Truth' every day revising, rewriting and burning history records to match the ever changing version of history dictated by their all-powerful leader, the Big Brother. Secretly though, deep in his heart Winston hates their cruel leadership, and wishes their defeat. A traitor in thought, his life would be forfeit if someone ever finds out, and there are spies everywhere…An unforgettable story about the inner strength and inherent weakness of the human spirit, struggling in the most oppressive of worlds. A book that teaches us to love and value freedom, and its costs; to cherish independent thought, and never letting go the fight. I LOVED the secret unfolding relationship with Julia, their quirkinessand even their doomed fate; and I can't express my heartbreak and sadness for the ultimate fate of the ever cheerful and loyal Tom Parsons. Gosh! This was a such a dark and grim story, but overall, enormously invaluable.A timeless masterpiece and one of the founding pillars of dystopian fiction. A must read in life, along withFahrenheit 451andBrave New World. The holy trinity of dystopia. Highly Recommendable!After a decade or so my memory is a bit hazy but I think I found the 'Goldstein book' part quite tedious; hence the four stars. Everything else was just perfect, darkly perfect. I remember enjoying this one immensely back in the day. 'Animal farm' as well, another absolute masterpiece. Boy I really need to read more Orwell one of these days!*** The movie Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) is a fantastic adaptation, greatly capturing much of the book's essence. Some liberties were taken of course, but overall pretty faithful to the original work. Coincidentally it was filmed in 1984! Can you believe it? Talk about brilliant perfect timing! John Hurt was spectacular, in one of his most iconic and remembered performances ever. May the good man rest in peace. Suzanna Hamilton was magnificent too; and Gregor Fisher as Parsons was totally on point., and boy did I hate O'Brien! Fortunately much of the book of Goldstein tediousness was omitted. Not a perfect film mind you, but a great adaptation. An absolute must watch, even if you didn't read the book.-----------------------------------------------PERSONAL NOTE:[1949] [339p] [Dystopia] [Highly Recommendable] [\"If they could make me stop loving you-that would be the real betrayal.\"] [\"If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.\"]-----------------------------------------------★★★★★Animal Farm★★★★☆1984-----------------------------------------------\"La guerra es la paz.

Un traidor en pensamiento, su vida estaría perdida si alguien llegara a enterarse, y hay espías por doquier…Una inolvidable historia sobre la fuerza interna e inherente debilidad del espíritu humano, luchando en el más opresivo de los mundos. Un libro que nos enseña a amar y valorar la libertad, y sus costos; apreciar el pensamiento independiente, y nunca abandonar la lucha. AME el secreto desarrollo de la relación con Julia, su excentricidade incluso su fatídico destino; y no puedo ni expresar mi desconsuelo y tristeza por el fin último del fiel y siempre positivo Tom Parsons. ¡Dios! Esta sí que fue una historia oscura y sombría, pero por sobre todo, enormemente invaluable.Una obra maestra de todos los tiempos y uno de los pilares fundacionales de la ficción distópica. Una lectura obligada de la vida, junto aFahrenheit 451yUn Mundo Feliz. La santa trinidad de la distopía. ¡Altamente Recomendable!Después de una década o más mi memoria es algo nubosa pero creo que la parte del 'Libro de Goldstein' fue bastante tediosa; por eso las cuatro estrellas. Todo lo demás fue simplemente perfecto, oscuramente perfecto. Recuerdo haber disfrutado inmensamente este libro en su día. 'Rebelión en la granja' también, otra gigante obra maestra. ¡Creo que necesito leer más de Orwell uno de estos días!*** La película (1984) es una fantástica adaptación, capturando enormemente mucha de la esencia del libro. Algunas libertades se tomaron por supuesto, pero dentro de todo bastante fiel a la obra original. ¡Coincidentemente fue filmada en 1984! ¿Increíble no? ¡Brillante y perfecta sincronización! John Hurt estuvo espectacular, en una de sus más icónicas y recordadas actuaciones jamás. Que el buen hombre descanse en paz. Suzanna Hamilton estuvo magnífica también; y Gregor Fisher como Parsons totalmente acorde, ¡y por Dios cómo odié a O'Brien! Afortunadamente mucho del tedioso libro de Goldstein fue omitido. No un filme perfecto debo aclarar, pero sí una genial adaptación. Un absoluto deber de ver en la vida, incluso si no leíste el libro.-----------------------------------------------NOTA PERSONAL:[1949] [339p] [Distopía] [Altamente Recomendable] [\"Si pueden obligarme a dejarte de amar... esa sería la verdadera traición.\"] [\"Si quieres guardar un secreto, también debes ocultártelo a ti mismo.\"]-----------------------------------------------"

        "user_review": "\"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\"This changed the way that I looked at ideologies and changed the way I looked at leadership. Cynical, scathing, and not without its flaws, this is still a stark, haunting glimpse at what could be.\"War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.\"Chilling.** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. The scene that I most often think is when Winston and Julia are captured.** 2019 reread - Lost in my memory was to what extent Orwell describes and explains his nightmare.Winston Smith cautiously and surreptitiously learns about the Brotherhood led by Goldstein and then learns all too well about doublethink.More than just a cautionary political tale, Orwell has described an ideological abyss into which we must not gaze; a glimpse at authoritarianism power plays to which the Nazis and Soviets never descended. While we can appreciate the reminder to avoid authoritarianism and his prophetic vision, the idea that truth can be arranged through media is perhaps the most relevant for us today.*** 2020 rereadThis time around I focused on the human side of this iconic novel – especially the relationship between Winston and Julia. In the past I have somewhat overlooked Julia as a character and thought that Orwell had neglected to form a strong female character, however I now think that she is every bit as strong as Winston and plays a central role in Orwell's message.Whereas Winston hates the party and wants to overturn it, Julia is much more practical and realistic in her rebellion. Winston thinks about the nature of the totalitarianism in abstract ways, Julia uses the terms of doublethink against the party and makes her frank sexuality a systematic rejection of party principle.While Orwell was forming a cautionary tale based upon his own experience in writing against authoritarian regimes like Stalin's, Hitler's (both actually named in the text) and by extension Moa, Mussolini and Franco, it occurs to me that the irony of Winston's dystopia is at least to some degree focused on the party members themselves. Winston embodies the use of media as propaganda and to disseminate inaccurate statements that prop up the party. In today's world we are already seeing this kind of abrogation of truth in favor of party purity.Every bit as timeless and relevant as it has ever been.*** 2023 reread -I think we all have had a situation similar to this: we search on the internet for something and then we start seeing advertisements related to our earlier search. That seems reasonable enough, understandable at least.What about this situation though: we have a VERBAL discussion with our spouse, alone in our kitchen, and then we start seeing advertisements about the subject of our speech.Wait a minute. OK, I've got an Amazon echo, they must have heard us talking.Wait a minute: heard us talking? In the \"privacy\" of our home? And who is they?The fear of surveillance has risen to an alarming level in the past few years and we can look back to 1948 and Orwell's tale as one source of this anxiety.I'm in my early 50s as I write this and my generation was raised to be somewhat suspect of governmental intrusions and overreach, taught to be vigilant against totalitarianism. We lived in the time of the Soviet Union and we were taught to be mindful of surveillance and propaganda.But what if the surveillance does not come from government?What if what we were taught was itself not wholly correct or accurate?A young person recently told me that they had read 1984 in high school in the past 3-4 years so this gave me some hope about the next generation.As a press officer in the military, I had a hand, as did Winston Smith, in shaping the news and thus history. If in my little corner of history, I cropped photos, erasing some people's involvement in an event, destroying the full accurate record of what happened, then extrapolate this ability at official omission and you can begin to see how easily can the truth be tweaked to match a desired narrative.This book is as provocative as ever, maybe more so in our strange political climate. More than anything else, this is a thought provoking novel, we are required to think critically about what Orwell states and he invites us, page after page, to think and rethink what we know and how we have been led to know it.If we \"know\" something is true, why do we know that? HOW do we know that truth? Like Faulkner's Absalom! Absalom! We are asked to consider our source and to be at least a little skeptical, of everything.In this reread, I also made notice of the casual violence that creeps up into Winston's thoughts. Was Orwell suggesting that the subrogation of Winston's natural feelings caused an aggressive response in him? Does injustice and tyranny lead to subconscious of animosity?Orwell describes how Proles represent 85% of Oceania, we see the propaganda and party policy from the perspective of the party, of a party member who actually initiates the remaking of news and thus history. The Party makes up 15% and the inner party is only about 2%. It occurred to me that I'm a Prole, most of us are on the outside looking in. Like George Carlin said, \"it's a club, and we're not in it.\" Did the Proles care anymore? Did they pay attention to the \"news\" or were they more like Julia, and only played the part for the surveillance state?I'm going to buy copies of this book for the young people in my life."

        "user_review": "I am a big fan of speculative fiction and in my literary travels I have encountered a myriad of dystopias, anti-utopias and places and societies that make one want to scream and........(with or without contemporaneous loss of bladder and other bodily functions)....Simply put, George Orwell's 1984 is unquestionably the most memorable andMOST DISTURBINGvision of a world gonemadutterly bat-shit psycho that I have ever experienced. Ever!!! Despite being published back in 1948, I have yet to find a more chilling, nightmarish locale than Orwell's iconic world ofBIG BROTHERandINGSOC. The very mention of either of those terms invokes images of Nazis and Soviet gulags in my mind. Yet Orwell's creation is in many ways even more insidious than these real-world bogeymen.I first read this book when I was 12 years old in 7th grade as a...get this...class reading assignment. Looking back on it, I have NO IDEA why on Earth we were reading this book at that age but I do recall we spent quite a bit of time discussing it. I wish I could recall the substance of those discussions because I can only imagine the kind of PIERCING INSIGHT that a group of hormonally challenged pre-teens thought up in regards to this book. Needless to say, I think that this is a book that is best appreciated AFTER your first pimple.Anyway, I decided to re-read this book recently as an adult in the hopes that I would be able to gain a great appreciation for this classic. Well, the book did more than that.IT ABSOLUTELY FLOORED ME. From the very first sentence,\"It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen\"to the unforgettable final sentence (which I will not give away here), this story sucked me in, beat the living shit out of me and through me out the other side a hollow, wasted wreck. I know, it doesn't sound very cheery, but it is a life-changing experience.I have always thought that one of the best and most important qualities of science fiction is that it frees the author to take the controversial, politically charged issues and trends of the day and create a possible future based on exaggerations of such trends and in so doing present a compelling and critical argument for change. Well NO ONE has ever done a better job than better Orwell in showing the possible nightmare (and thus potential danger) of a society without basic civil liberties and a government with complete and unchallenged control.This book is bleak, dreary, frightening, upsetting and absolutely BRILLIANT and one of my \"All Time Favorite\" novels. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! 6.0 stars............REMEMBER, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU............."

        "user_review": "\"The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.\"Just about everything Orwell says in1984is a maniacal truism. In some twisted form, everything reflects the truth of reality.Of course there are exaggerations, though nothing is far from plausibility. We are controlled by our governments, and often in ways we are not consciously aware of. Advertisements, marketing campaigns and political events are all designed for us to elicit a certain response and think in a desired way.1984takes this to the extreme. Cultural brainwashing becomes the chief goal. Assimilation into a passionless (and completely ignorant) mind-set becomes the most effective means of keeping the population down. If you can make a man forget (or deny) his past then he knows of no situation better than his current state: it's all he knows, so why would he act to change it? Subjugation becomes normality.\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.\"Big brother does this by harsh policing, excessive surveillance and language manipulation. The streets are claustrophobic and the people (the workers) can escape nothing. Every action, every word spoken, is recorded. The police are ready to grab anyone who steps remotely out of line. Controlling language is perhaps the most effective thought control method I've ever heard of. If language can be broken down into the absolute basics, the simplest and ordinary units, then people can only express themselves on a very minor level. They cannot think beyond their daily tasks because there are no words that connote dreams and fantasy.Step out of line and you are killed, though not before being dragged to room 101 for torture and even stronger methods of thought control. As such through the plot the book depicts a stark transformation, a transformation of man who was once willing to fight and to think but falls into one of the ingenious traps big brother sets for him to expose his criminality. Orwell's words are frightening because of their eerie parallels with reality. He shows us that we are not so far from big brother as we may think.\"We do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them.\"UnlikeAnimal Farmthis also leaves much to the imagination. It's a much more successful book and one that once it has been read, it certainly cannot be unread.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________"

This novel of anticipation, published in 1949, is striking! We follow the destinies of Winston and Julia in this universe, which is reminiscent of ours or what it could become. Of course, it is a fable, but the images strike and remain used for a long time. After reading this cult novel, we look at certain realities differently. It is a detour that is worth it, a must. Why did I wait so long to read it?"

Almost everyone of the commenters wrote how much they enjoyed this book and how it was one of their favorite books ever. While I am sure that maybe 1 of them was being truthful, I have to doubt atleast half of them..... Now I ask, Why do people lie about certain books? Do they think it makes them look smarter? Cooler? Well-rounded? I just don't get it, if you don't like something you don't like it. It's not neccessary to like it for classic book sake. This might not be making sense to some of you.... maybe you would have to know the people who were commenting, I don't know. But, I am sure all of you have been in a bookstore or talking with a co-worker, etc., and they spout out some well known \"hip\" book that they just 'adore'. You know this person and it's hard to see them reading period, much less what they are talking about.I guess my point is, don't be a fake book talker. Like it, Yay. Don't like it, Yay. I'm not going to think less of you for not liking something you \"SHOULD\" like by literary standards.Rant over."

Which pigeon hole? What label? What career?When a car driver loses control of the vehicle and strays from the path that was ahead, the car careers off the road. One might crash. One is no longer on the journey one originally set out on. One is lost. Off the beaten track.So, when one is a child and asked what career one wants, esoterically it means how can one be swayed or crashed and stopped from what one may want to be when one grows up. The only answer a child should give to their teacher (indoctrinater) is...HAPPY!👍🐯Who are these people?

Soon all money paid in wages or commerce will be digital and people will not survive in the New Virtual World unless one is chipped or connected to the 5G network. Understand that money is phony. It is paper or a figure on a PC screen. Soon to be a digital concept, like in the film In Time. Money used to be made of copper, silver and gold. This is when coins actually held value, worth it's weight in gold actually meant something. Then the Templars invented the Banking system, (now they are called Freemasons) a Fiat pyramid system that is illegal yet, no person seems to care. That is the way it is. Only because of ignorance. Acquiescence, Taxation is a fraud. It is theft. Time to wake up before it is too late.Club of Rome, Skull and Bones, Knights of the Realm, Knights of Malta, Rosicrucians, CFR, just a few of the Nefarious institutions. London School Of Economics and the Tavistock Institute. Oh! And the female freemasonic Eastern Star. Maybe I have said too much but, I don't care anymore.That is today's Rant.Everybody should read 1984 and also watch the film.Update:The Sex Pistols, a great British bandFully aware, of the hidden handThe entity, that controls, from most high, looking downElevated, Godlike, Alpha, The Crown💓👍🐯"

        "user_review": "1948: Europe was only starting to recover from the slaughter of World War II. Nazi Germany had been crushed by the Russian army in the East and by the Anglo-American forces in the West. The totalitarian regimes of Hitler, Mussolini and Imperial Japan were defeated. Stalin was going strong. Franco was undisturbed. However, the war was not quite over: the victors, Russia on one side, the USA on the other, were now superpowers staring stonily at each other, their hands loaded with a new and deadly arsenal.Orwell wrote1984, right afterAnimal Farm, in this ominous post/cold/perpetual-war context, and many aspects of it are steeped in the horrors of tyranny, dehumanisation and disaster. Winston Smith, the wretched protagonist, lives in an alternate history where everyone is under constant surveillance (via \"telescreens\" and widespread denunciation). A place where propaganda, misinformation, history re-writing, language and thought manipulation, \"reality control\" (2+2=5) are pervasive tools to make every individual conform with the \"Ingsoc\" Party's ideology. The result is a diehard totalitarian state, a perfect hell on earth, where individuality is \"vaporised\" at the whim of a spectral Big Brother and where even love is impossible.Worth highlighting in the novel: the long interlude about \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\" (II, 9) — inserted within a slightly incongruous romance episode — and the appendix on \"The Principles of Newspeak\" — written as if from an unknown point, far in the future, when the madness has eventually subsided. Both sections are stupefying. Yet, the last third of the book is probably one of the worst nightmares in literature: a prolonged torture and brainwashing session that plunges into utter insanity.Erich Fromm's afterword (included at the end of the Signet Classics paperback edition) rightly puts1984in perspective with its historical context and other works of speculative fiction, likeBrave New World. Still, while Huxley's satire is substantially ironic, almost jovial, the general tone in Orwell's book is dismal, revolting, at times practically unbearable. At any rate, this novel has become one of the canonical landmarks of politicaldystopia. Hannah Arendt possibly read1984when writingThe Origins of Totalitarianisma couple of years after Orwell's death. Its influence after that, on works likeThe Handmaid's Tale, is manifest as well.Michael Radford's heartrending film adaptation is very faithful to the novel. But my favourite film \"free-adaptation\" remainsBrazilby Terry Gilliam.Blade Runner, too, borrows much of its 2019 Los Angeles architecture from1984's Miniluv pyramidal building descriptions.The days of Hitler and Stalin are long gone now. Even so, almost a century later, in a time of political paralysis and corruption, where the most prominent \"doubleplusgood duckspeaker\" politicians of the world make ample use of a new form ofnewspeakanddoublethink; in a time of threatened privacy and increasing digital surveillance and mindfuck, Orwell's prophetic warning is as relevant as ever."

        "user_review": "I've put off writing a review for 1984 because it's simply too daunting to do so. I liked 1984 even better after a second reading (bumping it up from a 4 star to a 5 star) because I think that, given the complexity of the future created by Orwell, multiple readings may be needed to take it all in. I thought it was genius the first time and appreciated that genius even more the second time.Orwell had a daunting task: creating a future nearly half a century away from the time period in which he was writing. This future had to be its own complex, independent society, but it also had to be the natural end result of the totalitarianism Orwell witnessed in the communist and socialist regimes of World War II. That's part of the horror of 1984: this future is a recognizable one, even in the 21st century. It's easy to see how those in control can, through manipulation and propaganda, maintain that control simply for the sake of sating their own power hunger. It's easy to say \"no one could ever tell me what to think or what to do,\" but the Party's use of Big Brother, the Thought Police, the Two-Minute Hate, and Doublethink make it easy to see how a person's ability to think independently and discern fiction from reality can be eroded when there is no touchstone to fact. Revising and rewriting the past to make certain that Big Brother and the Party are always correct has effectively eliminated historical accuracy. How can one think and reason in a society where everything is a fabrication?Another facet of 1984 that I find fascinating is the relationship between Winston and Julia. Winston claims Julia is a \"rebel from the waist down,\" engaging in promiscuity and hedonistic indulgences forbidden by the Party. She doesn't care about social injustice or defining \"reality\"; she only longs for what will make her feel good in the moment and only rebels far enough to get what she wants. By comparison, Winston is an intellectual rebel, constantly worrying over the issues of truth and freedom and the real, unvarnished past, but limited in how far he's willing to push the boundaries (until he meets Julia). Together, they make a complete rebellion--physical and mental, but apart they find themselves impotent to stand up to the Party.A cautionary tale, social commentary, and exemplary example of dystopian fiction, 1984 is one of those perfect novels that not only entertains, but forces one to think about the danger associated with giving any one person or entity too much power or control over our lives--issues well worth consideration in post-9/11 America.Cross posted atThis Insignificant Cinder"

        "user_review": "Yes! This book! Amazing! Terrifying, brutal, intricate, prophetic - and, in one big word, GENIUS!This was a reread - the last time I read this was over 20 years ago and I wanted to see if the 5 star rating and its standing in one of my top 3 favorite books held up - and it most certainly does.If this book was written today in the midst of the slew of dystopian novels that come out, it may not have stood out. But, this book was way ahead of its time. Written in a post WWII era where the fears of dictatorships and brutal tyranny were fresh in the minds of the people, this book plays off that fear and adds a dark vision of a potential future.This is where the genius of Orwell comes in. The book is mainly the manifesto of the Party that the main character is seeking to rebell against. But, the ideology and descriptions of this dystopian world are not presented in a boring way - they are fascinating. The fact that Orwell created this world and laid out not only a terrifying political environment, but the rules for the new language they were creating, is beyond amazing.Finally, some of the things he describes sound all too possible in our current world. The controversial elections this week in the US only added to the intensity of this book.Read this! Especially if you are a fan of modern dystopia, you must read the fore fathers - 1984 and Brave New World.And, remember - Big Brother is watching!"

        "user_review": "'If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.''History stopped in 1936,' George Orwell oncesaid tofellow authorArthur Koestler. During his time in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell observed the pervasiveness of propaganda as a pillar upholding authoritarianism, from censored newspapers to lies perpetuated for political convenience and began to fear that 'the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.' This fear presented itself across the whole of his works during his short life, culminating in his famous1984where he warns 'who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.' Published in 1949 and written as Orwell wasdying from tuberculosis, he didn't live long to see how1984and his dire warnings against authoritarianism would have a lasting effect even to this day, often being used by all sides of the political spectrum as a cultural touchstone. And while this is mostly owing to the broad criticisms showing how any ideology can become oppressive when hungry for power, it also exemplifies his own dread that words will be twisted and quoted as cudgels to fit a desired purpose as truth is washed away. A harrowing story of dystopia, surveillance, manipulation and resistance being crushed underfoot,1984still chills today with its themes on collective vs individual identity under totalitarianism and controlling all aspects of reality to eliminate all those who step outside the boundaries of orthodoxy.'We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.'When we read sci-fi, words like \"prophetic\" and \"warning\" often get applied.1984continues to remain relevant due to its warnings against irresponsible use of rhetoric, which almost makes the references to it amusing or ironic. Such as theApple computer commercialin 1984 that uses the novel for the sake of marketing (and what is \"marketing\" but a euphemism for propaganda) a product that would lead to all sorts of concerns over government surveillance for which people would quote1984in addressing them. I think the term prophetic often frames a book in a way that causes us to consider how close it came true, which seems beside the point because when we look at the ways itdidn't, that often becomes an excuse for delegitimization or ignoring the warning.Born Eric Arthur Blair in Bengal in 1903 and passing in 1950, Orwell's short life left a lasting legacy from his works likeAnimal Farmbeing classroom staples in the US and terms like \"Orwellian\" being blithely applied to anything that brushes against government use of technology and surveillance. Hardly a political cycle goes by in the US without1984coming up. In the US alone in the past decade we saw it returning to the paperback bestseller list under the Trump administration when the term \"alternative facts\" was being tossed around, and a few years later it was being referenced by the GOP to claim the government was denying an election victory and inventing the January 6th terrorist attack to arrest people. Though with a president making statements like \"What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,\" naturally one is reminded of Orwell writing 'the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,' and we are reminded of the power of literature and how we often turn to great works for guidance during uncertain times, though often, as Orwell warned, using it as propaganda shorn of context. Orwell did live long enough to see the novel used improperly, having to put out a statement almost immediately for those who wished to use the novel as an example against the British Labor Party. 'My recent novel is NOT an on Socialism or on the British Labor Party (of which I am a supporter),' he wrote, and an introduction to the book states:'every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.'Which becomes a pretty important distinction, as Orwell believed in better form of governing yet also was suspicious of anyone who would seek out power in order to change it as he writes in the novel 'we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.' I feel1984is best read with an openness to nuance and in good faith, which is often glossed over for the sake of political identifying which is, ironically or not, the exact thing he was warning against. Which is to say, call out problems even if it's your own \"side\" and don't create further divide by abusing rhetoric for the sake of scoring quick political points.I think there is a tendency when trying to score quick political points that things need to have some sort of unassailable pure aim to them.1984is critical of any regime that seeks to keep power, but narrowing it to a pointed attack against an opponent without seeing how it might apply to your own political \"team\" (US politics is so much cheering for your \"home team\" than actually hashing out politics, especially lately, though I also find the whole \"both sides\" angle to often be used less for establishing nuance than trying to delegitamize any efforts for progress too, but hell who am I to say I'm just as bad as anyone) is more convenient. But even Orwell himself isn't a \"pure\" figure, having been aninformantfor the British government delivering a list of names of people suspected of communism (the list includesJohn Steinbeckand many have observed that there is a strong presence of gay people on the list which makes many of Orwell's rather homophobic comments seem all the more menacing). He also, asA. E. Dysonobserved in his book on Orwell, that he 'had a very English dislike of intellectuals, supposing that anyone willing to wear such a label would be diminished or depraved.' Which is all neither here nor there, but goes to show how one can create a narrative out of anything, and that is what1984taps into.So let's move on to the novel and head on down to Room 101. As I said earlier,1984can be read as a culmination of a lot of his themes and ideas across his short career. Warning of totalitarianism arrives everywhere with Orwell, such asBurmese Dayswhen he describes the town as 'a stifling, stultifying world…which every word and every thought is censored,' not unlike1984because 'free speech is unthinkable.' And one can read inKeep the Aspidistra Flying, with Comstock (a name derived from Common and Stock similarly to how the terms in 1984 are often truncated phrases) bemoaning 'I'm dead, You're dead. We're all dead people in a dead world,' as a precursor to the pivotal moment when Winston and Jane declare 'we're dead' right before being exposed as having been set up. For Orwell, speech and language is very key. Language itself is fallible and can be morphed to meet many purposes—it's the medium of poets for a reason—and in1984Orwell examines how this can be used to negate truth and establish entirely fictional histories that become generally accepted as a means to upholding power.'War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.'Winston's job is to rewrite history to fit the purpose of the party. Within his department we find all sorts of nefarious linguistic play designed to control the masses because it is thought that 'if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.' We can argue that we see this notion reflected in our modern day, where books exposing history that can be seen as a blemish on the US are banned or dismissed as unpatriotic or trying to rewrite history (the irony in the latter is thick) and many have spoken on the suppression of queer books as an effort to erase the language people need to assess their own identities. What Orwell is looking at is the way language and propaganda is used to control. I enjoy the way he makes creative use of language to compile entire terminologies used by Ingsoc (the party in control that is pretty blatantly a nod to Soviet Russia) to create a propagated history that fits whatever they need, even erasing the history of entire wars to portray other countries as allies and erase the recent memory of them as enemies.'Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.'To step outside the orthodoxy of the Party's version of history is to become an enemy of the Party and society and find yourself \"vaporized\" and erased from history. 'Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think,' Orwell writes, 'Orthodoxy is unconsciousness,' and when the truth we know conflicts with the truth of the Party, it must be edited. 'Lies,' writesRebecca Solnitin her bookOrwell's Roses, 'the assault on language -- were the necessary foundation for all the other assaults.' Afterall, 'the first victim of war is truth, goes the old saying, and a perpetual war against truth undergirds all authoritarianisms.' \"Doublespeak\" comes into play here, where one can hold conflicting opinions in their mind and just accept them, and the Party finds that fear is a great tool for ensuring willing erasure of truth. 'Truth is not a statistic,' Winston argues, claiming that just because the masses agree doesn't make it true, though over the novel we see how the power to rewrite \"truth\" can potentially eviscerate anyone who says otherwise until it becomes the only known \"truth.\" Returning toRebecca Solnit, she observes:'To be forced to live with the lies of the powerful is to be forced to live with your own lack of power over the narrative, which in the end can mean lack of power over anything at all. Authoritarians see truth and fact and history as a rival system they must defeat.'It is in this way the Party keeps people subservient. 'A hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance,' and Winston, upon reading Goldstein's book (the book serves as an insert into the narrative that provides a LOT of exposition about the world and its structures as well as being a sort of Marxist-esque handbook, though it only offers thehowthings came to be and never thewhy, much to Winston's interest), Winston realizes that the proles (the working class) are the possible solution. However he realized the proles can only revolt if they become conscious of their conditions and only can become conscious of their conditions if they revolt (not a far cry from Orwell's own statement 'we cannot win the war without introducing Socialism, nor establish Socialism without winning the war.'), and worries this may never happen. There is also the issue that a revolution will only put a new Party in power that will inevitably oppress again, just in different ways.'The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.'So without giving anything away because this book is full of surprises (though one may guess if they have readWebyYevgeny Zamyatin, which Orwell \"borrows\" heavily from—as does Huxley'sBrave New World—and still remains my favorite of the three), across this novel we see a spirit of resistance rise and the forces of power come to meet it with a heavy boot and the power of erasure. While much of the novel focuses on the individual versus the collective, the biggest act of betrayal comes at the end in choosing to protect oneself, the individual, and asking for the harm of others in order to enter the \"protection\" of the collective Party by erasing any part of oneself outside their orthodoxy.Where once was the belief 'to die hating them, that was freedom,' we see 'in the face of pain there are no heroes' and fear keeps people in line. Reminding the people of the frailty of being an individual drives them towards compliance. Yet, in another way, we see the collective existing because of the desire of individuals to protect themselves at the expense of everyone else: nobody will revolt out of fear for themselves and in doing so allows the oppression of all to continue. I think this is whatUrsula K. Le Guinis getting at when her books look at the need to integrate both the individual and collective by refusing easy binaries and hierarchies. She also, especially inThe Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopiaargues that history can never become stagnant and that, like Orwell argues, an revolution will try to uphold power and oppress leading to the necessity of another revolution. While Le Guin sees this as the natural course of history (the double meaning of revolution as a revolt and a constant turning cycling through) Orwell sees this as a constant erosion of truth due to the weaponization of language as propaganda that will inevitably erase reality in place of a false, collective reality where truth is sent to the grave.'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.'One might find1984to be a rather bleak book, but it is also intended as a warning. There are many minor warnings building up to the larger, main point—such as the paperweight symbolizing a past now inaccessible where art could be beautiful for the sake of beauty, as well as symbolizing the frailty of the individual—and that we must take care to use language responsibly lest we hold the door for open propaganda. We can even do this on an individual level, such as not perpetuating misinformation (funny political memes are easy to share but dilute the severity of problems when we poke fun at, say, the looks or mannerisms of a politician instead of focusing on their policies) and not giving in to easy attacks instead of respecting the nuances. And so that's my rough rant on1984, a book that lives on for both its relevance and its political convenience and maybe we should all remember that truth is more important than winning an argument or scoring political edgy points. I fail at it too, we all do, but Orwell reminds us to do better.⅘'A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face.'"

        "user_review": "First, understand that I am editing this review after several outraged responses. I knew that \"Wrinkle\" was considered to be a classic, but I was unaware that it was considered a Beloved Classic Beyond Criticism. I read this in grade school and just REread it aloud, to my daughter. I didn't have a clear memory of it, though I remember that I loved the way it started. Now I realize why I forgot so much of it. I STILL love the first 3 chapters, and dislike the rest. But since some of you found (and WILL find, I'm sure) my review to be judgmental, harsh and undiplomatic (a review IS a critique, right?) to the point of insulting, I thought I'd do a little research, look over the book again, think about it some more. So I've edited this review. But I find I just can't retract my statements. They are my opinion, that's all, and I haven't changed my mind. I can only try to be open minded, be honest, and try to explain my thoughts & feelings more clearly. Otherwise, I'd be a simpering fake.Like C.S. Lewis books (especially the last of his Chronicles of Narnia, The Last Battle), A Wrinkle In Time has strong, (heavy-handed, I think), overtones of Christian doctrine. I'm not anti-spiritual, but I have a personal discomfort with this kind of religious doctrine. (You many not, and that's fine.) But more than that issue, the book is an odd combination of intelligent hard science, interesting quantum science that is brushed over, and quotes from the bible. At least there are a few respectful mentions of other spiritual leaders from other cultures, and moral messages from classic literature and philosophers. I understand this combination garnered criticism from both religious fundamentalists as well as atheists and secular society. L'Engle has earned my respect for taking on the difficult and controversial marriage of science and religion. She has also earned my criticism for raising this issue and then failing to really grapple with it. It's treated lightly, as though it's a natural thing that should be easy to accept, in spite of the many holes and inconsistencies in her story. I wouldn't even mind, except that this book takes itself SO seriously! It's easy to imagine that a school teacher might use this book to demonstrate that Evolutionist Theory and Creationism can be combined, but I find science and religion to have a disjointed and uneasy coexistence in this book. One is always dropped abruptly for the other. Or at least, it seems so to me.Ok. Now that I have tackled that big one, let's move on. I found the characters rather flat, (the genius child, the misfit girl, the beautiful, genius, scientist mother who nonetheless stays home and cooks stew in bunsen burners while her husband has adventures). The story itself is made up of vague scenarios of conflict of the psyche and spirit, with the entire Universe at stake. L'Engle's metaphors are obvious and their manifestations flat. [SPOILER ALERT] There is a quest to fight a \"Darkness\" (oooh!) that wants to rid us all of individuality & free will. There are 3 beings who used to be stars before they died in the fight with the \"Darkness\" and became something beyond our comprehension. They can appear in any form to us, so that we have some way of processing their existence. They are, in fact, so beyond anything knowable that I can't feel much for them or say much about them, except that they make a convenient plot device for transporting the characters throughout the Universe and the story. Anyway, the \"Darkness\" takes over a planet which turns into a kind of sci-fi beehive, with brainwashed automatons. I found the planet to be delightfully creepy and would have liked to know more about it, (even if it seems suspiciously like a thinly veiled anti-communist warning message.) So guess what's doing the brainwashing? - a giant, evil, disembodied brain, called IT, who is personally responsible for spreading the Darkness across the Universe. Really? A brain? Doesn't anyone else find this simplistic and cliche? The main character defeats this brain by gushing love. I am quite sure that many, many readers were moved to tears by Meg's gushing, but I do not happen to be that kind of person. Before Meg realizes that she has the power to gush love, the crusaders tesser through time and space (no explanation of how the father can do this) to a fascinating planet with very interesting aliens who can't see, but have other senses. I'd have loved to know more about their society and these mysterious other senses, but again, these ideas aren't very developed.These are the things in this book, and in L'Engle's writing that I love: As I mentioned, I love her courage in at least attempting a controversial issue like mixing science and spirituality. I love that this book has the heart to recognize love as the greatest power, and that it has the wisdom to recognize fear as one of the biggest weapons. I love that individuality prevails, and the romantic in me approves of the loving, whole family. I love that she has enough respect for children that she included difficult vocabulary and a few difficult concepts. Many children are far more capable of handling complex ideas than we give them credit for, especially if we expose them to these things early on. I love that L'Engle doesn't underestimate them in this way, at least initially, on the surface. Since my biggest problems with this book all involve my finding it simplistic, naive, and certain parts of it cliche & obvious, I wonder if I need to remind myself that it's meant for children. Perhaps children should be idealistic, or even naive, in the way that this book is. But then I wonder if that is another way of underestimating them. ESPECIALLY since I felt exactly the same way when I read this book as a child!Wind In The Willows makes me feel closer to God, or a creative power (though there's some gushing in there too, at the end.) The Jungle Book explores social constructs and morals, more deeply and naturally, for me. A Sound Of Thunder blew my mind, in grade school, with its \"butterfly effect\" theory of the power and responsibility of each individual. All of these are childrens' books, though they span generations, and time and space, more gracefully than tessering did for me. I could name so many more.But, if A Wrinkle In Time opened your mind to new ideas, (instead of making you feel frustrated by light treatment of them), made you question some latent prejudice, (instead of feeling bored by obvious metaphors), lifted your spirits & made you cheer for bookish outcasts, (instead of feeling that no one is that one-dimensional) or cry for the love of a big sister & little brother, (instead of cringing when a version of \"I love you Charles Wallace\" appears 19 times in 2 pages), then it is a wonderful book. For you."

        "user_review": "So 41 of my goodreads friends have readA Wrinkle in Time, but I never picked up the book until these past few weeks. I'm not sure how this novel and I slipped past each other in my youth. I'm guessing that since the main character was a girl I wasn't that interested in middle school and when I grew older the science fiction elements didn't appear strong enough to snag my interest. Oh well. Last weekend I boughtA Wrinkle in Timeat a Borders near the Seattle airport. I wanted the novel to get me through the grueling twelve hour journey (whoo, flight delays and pre-dawn connecting flights!) home, and I thank Ms. L'Engle for the perfect story for early hour near-hallucinatory reading in the middle of the Minneapolis International promenade.What makes this book so good? First off,A Wrinkle in Timeworks under the assumption that kids are smart enough either to grasp the nuances of some fairly deep physics or, if they don't get every detail, they'll flow with the storyline anyway. One woman I know said, \"I didn't understand all the science when I was a kid but I still loved it.\" That makes sense to me. Hell, I didn't understand all the science now, and I'm (supposedly) a grown-up. L'Engle doesn't just say, \"And then they traveled time.\"She tries to explain how time travel might work.I wonder if so many kids, especially girls, liked this novel because they felt L'Englerespectedthem as intelligent readers.Second,A Wrinkle in Timeframes Meg's personality as multi-faceted and more complex than just about any I've encountered in YA literature. In fact, reading this novel I couldn't help but consider her a template on which some more modern coming-of-age characters (think Harry Potter) were modeled. She's brave but doubts her own strength in an tangible, authentic manner. And her relationship with Calvin is sweet without getting allHigh School Musical.Third, the evil in this novel is damn scary and the darkness pure and substantial. We're talking elemental, unadulterated evil that manifests itself in the fear and conformity of those who break down in its presence. And the characters' encounters with this evil feel real. The climatic scenes are perhaps slightly too swift but the nuances of the battle fit well with a remarkably philosophical (and Christian, but in a positive way) resolution of good and evil's conflict.If my friends' reviews are any indication a lot of smart girls who turned into strong, intelligent women grew up under the spell ofA Wrinkle in Time. I feel like I know them a little better after reading this novel, and I can see them all, around age ten, turning the book's pages in their rooms, feeling their own strength and potential. And that's damn cool, really, don't you think, a whole generation of girls readingA Wrinkle in Time? Maybe little girls across America are googling \"tesseract\" as we speak…"

        "user_review": "The story takes about 100 pages of tedious, banal dialogue, to get to the point where you are told that this is a battle against Evil, and all you need is love. But everything is so oversimplified, so sketchy--everything is reduced to big words, like IT, and evil. This IT, also called the Dark Thing, is striving to create a communist-type society where everyone conforms, down to the little children who bounce their balls in uniform rhythms and who live in cutter-box houses.I liked Meg in the beginning, she was a believable character, filled with her own problems, and I really wanted for things to work out for her. But when she went on her journey, and especially since she got to that dreadful communist planet, she got hysterical. She did not \"say\" anything for half of the book--she yelled, gasped, screamed, cried, etc. She got ticked off at everyone for everything.Then there might have been an indication that Charles Wallace was going to be a player, but he fizzled. There are constant references to him being special, but we never find out what was so special about him, besides putting a 30 year old into a 4 year old body and calling it \"genius\". There was all this build-up for the confrontation between him and IT, but nothing happened. He looked at the guy, let him in, and became filled with ideas from Lenin himself.Then there are worlds. These characters traveled to a planet that was described in three lines with beautiful flowers and a tall mountain. Then another planet is not described at all except to say that it was a winter wonderland type of a place. The residence of the Happy Medium was another planet where they were conveniently in a cave, and final stop was in a planet that was probably like Earth, except all we know about it is that it had rows of houses and tall buildings. There you have it--traveled all through the known Universe and have nothing to show for it. No imagination to describe and develop a world.Then there are bizarre references to god/s that come out of nowhere, or in the oddest places, and disappear into nowhere. Characters are underdeveloped; scenes are not finished; worlds are left to themselves; theme is the fear of religious right of the communist left.It's a caricature of evil, done perhaps in the belief that kids won't get it otherwise. There's not much in terms of a plot, the worlds described are paper-thin, and it shows no historical understanding, no outside knowledge.More of Purplycookie's Reviews @:http://www.goodreads.com/purplycookieBook Details:TitleA Wrinkle in Time (Time #1)AuthorMadeleine L'EngleReviewed ByPurplycookie"

Or at least, myreadingworld.Welcome to sci-fi, kid!I have no idea how many times I've read this story, but as a child, I read it so much that this awesome cover eventually fell off. Just so many great memories of these characters make it is easily my favorite childhood novel.After doing a re-read of it this year, I have to say it holds up pretty well for a book that was written in 1962. One of the things that help it age so decently is that L'Engle didn't have much in it thatcouldage it. No brand names, no popular trends, no references to any politics of the day. The only stuff that really let you know you were reading a book written in the '60s was Calvin saying things likeGolly!unironically or Charles Wallace being disrespectful by calling his fatherPops.It's a very simple story that I read in just under 2 hours, but I remember it being complexenoughwhen I was younger. I think it hits all the right points for a kid who feels out of place and weird, and didn't weallfeel out of place and weird at that age?Yes. Yes, we did.The only thing I was less excited about this time around were all the religious references, but the book is what it is, and you just kind of have to accept that God is a big theme in this and move on if you want to enjoy it. It's not too preachy, so there's that.Will kids today like it? I'm trying to get mine to read it now, so ask me again in 6 months.But I'd been putting off re-reading this thing for 20 plus years and was pleasantly surprised that it was still such a charming story.Highly Recommended...for nostalgia."

        "user_review": "Am I the first living 64 year old who had never read this book- until now - March, 2017.that is?Random Thoughts .........I was surprised to discover this story was about a little GIRL --not a WIZARD......I was more surprised that Meg, 13 years old, had three other siblings... two twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys, and a younger brother, Charles Wallace Murray, who is a child prodigy.....with parents who were scientist. THERE IS A REAL FAMILY -WITH REAL PEOPLE in this book! NOT SURE WHY THIS SURPRISED ME!.....I'm thinking \"HOT DAMN, I might like this story\".... and my daughters might have.... but as far as I know .... they missed reading this one too.Heck, the first page was 'great' - the first sentence was 'classic-great': \"It was a dark and stormy night\".What child doesn't perk up to hear a story with those first words?So....I continue reading 'remembering' that not long ago 'ELLIE' praised this book SO HIGHLY ....as her FAVORITE children's book ( she and I both have passion for the Velveteen Rabbit)....that I KNEW I HAD TO FINALLY READ IT. I bought a used copy at my recycle bookstore for a dollar. THANK YOU ELLIE!!!!! :) whew...I'm glad I didn't miss this gem!!! I loved the characteristics of the kids and adults....each unique in their own ways......What creative names for characters: Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Witch.... 'charming supernatural neighbors'. .....as well as the lovely Aunt Beast.The three *W* women escort Meg, Charles, and another boy, Calvin O'Keefe. from Meg's school --through the universe by means of SCI FI UNIVERSE TRANSPORTATION-- \"tesseract\" - A fifth dimensional phenomenon-- ET hasn't phoned home yet.....on a mission to rescue Meg and Charles father. Meg, and the Mrs. W's all agree that the mysterious disappearance of the father is very strange and has something to do with the term \"tesseract\". After all he is a scientist and was working on a project before his disappearance.The Trio W-women and children travel through the universe and visit different planets - a utopian world- with creatures disguised as humans. First they bump into evil... then they are taken to a woman to look through a crystal ball. The children are learning that there is both evil and good in the world. They see much darkness through that crystal ball down here on planet earth. They also see that artist's, and philosophers, and religious folks are fighting against the evil.AT THIS POINT IF I WERE A CHILD - I WOULD HAVE QUESTIONS --THE CHILD ME WOULD ASK: \"well, my daddy died--[I was 4]. I'd want to know if he left me because he got tired of all the fighting on earth--and since I've always wondered since the day he died -- not knowing what the hell that meant -- if he was coming back soon --- and could I go on the mission with Meg and bring my daddy back home too?\" This book might have scared me as a child -- I would have needed a tender adult reading it with me.ON WITH THIS STORY:They soon travel to a planet called Camazotz.... where they find Meg's father: trapped!The planet is being controlled by an evil brain and with powerful telepathic abilities- called \"IT\".This story begins to gets MORE SCARY..... I would have been on the edge of my seat. Note: I don't read much science fiction - but the children are threatened by the possibility of their minds being controlled through a telepathic takeover.Whew..... laughing ....I was exhausted by the end.....OF COURSE IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING....I HATE that felt like crying in this children's book! I hate all you people who told me it's a must read .....because for this girl it WAS!!!!!! I LOVED IT!!! - you mean people!!!I love believing there is GOOD in the world .. so why am I sad?A special appreciation to the Goodreads community-- I might never have read this book without all the the LOVE & EXPRESSION for this children's classic! Thank you!"

Starting with the first line: It was a dark and stormy night. Then, the mention of stew. One member of my family thinks that stew is ew, and \"stew\" was mentioned six times in this relatively short book. Finally, the mention of IT. Trust me. I hate going to IT.I was able to follow the plot—it seems relatively straightforward. However, the symbolism was lost on me (other than I know that there was some religious symbolism). A Wrinkle in Time makes me want to locate someone smarter than myself and ask them to explain it to me.At the beginning of A Wrinkle in Time, the author said that children get this book and adults do not. Maybe I am overthinking it?A Wrinkle in Time is a fast-paced fantasy novel. In my opinion, it was a little too fast-paced especially in the beginning where we are introduced to a deluge of characters. It was also a bit too focused on world building instead of on plot.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

It is the first book in L'Engle's Time Quintet series, which follows the Murry and O'Keefe families.The book spawned two film adaptations, both by Disney: a 2003 television film directed by John Kent Harrison, and a 2018 theatrical film directed by Ava DuVernay.One night, thirteen-year-old Meg Murry meets an eccentric new neighbor, Mrs. Whatsit, who refers to something called a tesseract.She later finds out it is a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance.The following day, Meg, her child genius brother Charles, and fellow schoolmate Calvin visit Mrs. Whatsit's home, where the equally strange Mrs. Who and the unseen voice of Mrs. Which promise to help Meg find and rescue her father..عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «چین دادن زمان»؛ «چینی بر زمان»؛ «سفر شگفت انگیز»؛ نویسنده: مادلین ال اینگل؛ تاریخ خوانش: روز بیست و یکم ماه سپتامبر سال 2009میلادیعنوان: چینی بر زمان؛ نویسنده: مادلین ال اینگل؛ مترجم: صدیقه ابراهیمی (فخار)؛ بی جا، مترجم، 1371؛ در 216ص؛ موضوع داستانهای نوجوانان از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: سفر شگفت انگیز؛ نویسنده: مادلین ال اینگل (لنگل)؛ مترجم: صدیقه ابراهیمی (فخار)؛ تهران، دستان، چاپ دوم 1381؛ در203ص؛ شابک9646555888؛عنوان: چین دادن زمان؛ نویسنده: مادلین ال اینگل؛ مترجم: صدیقه ابراهیمی (فخار)؛ تهران، کاروان، کتابهای لوک، 1388؛ در240ص؛ شابک9789641750833؛بـُعد پنجم همچون بعدهای: طول، عرض، ارتفاع، و زمان، بعد دیگری از دنیای ماست، اگر بـُعد پنجم را بشناسیم، میتوانیم فواصل طولانی چندین سال نوری را، در چند دقیقه میانبر بزنیم؛ خانم «چیستان (میسز واتزایت)»، «کیستان (میسز ویچ)» و «کدام (میسز هو)»، سه پیرزن عجیب، در خانه‌ ای به نام خانه ی دیوها زندگی می‌کنند؛ آنها به ظاهر ترسناک هستند، زیرا لباس‌هایی شبیه جادوگرها می‌پوشند؛ اما «چارلز» باور دارد، که آنها می‌دانند پدرش کجاست؛ در یک شب توفانی و تاریک، این سه پیرزن عجیب، همراه با «چارلز» و خواهرش «مارگریت»، و دوستشان «کالوین»، راهی سفری دور و دراز بین سیارات دوردست می‌شوند، تا پدر «چارلز» را پیدا کنند، و از آن مهم‌تر دنیا را نجات دهند؛ در داستان علمی-تخیلی حاضر شرح این سفر به تصویر واژه های خیال انگیز کشیده شده استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 08/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 13/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "[Later note: Had discussion with author about this book and why it means so much to so many people—specifically women. Also read excellent NYTimes piece about the fiftieth anniversary.Some books are powerful for their readers because of their context; in this case, the utter lack in popular kid's literature of 1962 of characters like Meg—real girls, who cared about atypical subjects like math, who were unashamed to be other than pink-wearing cheerleaders. To find a powerful role model in a novel must be a wonderful thing, especially for bookish girls. And maybe it makes sense that as a boy in the seventies, I missed that entirely.Still, rereading as an adult, I found it unbearably heavy-handed. Hence the two star rating: It was okay.]One of those overrated books the response to which defies explanation. Clunky, heavy-handed, and as obvious in its way asThe Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I was only ever able to force myself through this as an adult (having been turned off of it by a filmstrip I saw in school), and no doubt this is the sort of novel--like the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs--that must be first loved as a younger reader. Ugh."

        "user_review": "I have one general, self-imposed rule about reviewing on this site: I write about the books I've read in the order I've finished them. By that logic, I should be cobbling together my reaction toHungerright now but I am so taken by this childhood staple that there's no room in my brain for anything other than uncontrollable glee over this book that another Madeleine has given to the world.I never read this book as a kid. I didn't read it as a teenager or a college student. I read it for the first time with 30 coming at me like a crazed stalker who won't let a pesky thing like a restraining order stand in the way. And that did concern me, especially after half-heartedly slogging through the first four books comprising the Narnia Chronicles a few years ago before taking an indefinite break from tackling what should have been another enthusiastically remembered staple of a young reader's diet. I was afraid that I'd completely missed out on enjoyingA Wrinkle in Time, a novel that I have heard praised up and down by so many people as the prime example of howgoodchildren's literature can be.So I read it like I read as a wee lass who didn't realize that she was poised at the very beginning of what would become a lifelong pursuit of books fueled by an insatiable need to keep reading. I read well past my bedtime with one tiny light illuminating the path to somewhere magically transportive, knowing full well that the bookworm gratification far outweighed the inevitability of being a zombie all morning. I read it when I should have been doing something else as dictated by responsibility. I read to be told a story and to consider ideas I'd never come across in the world beyond two covers, sure, but mostly I read to give myself up to a writer's lush landscape, to lose myself in someone else's words. I read it to let my imagination run free through a universe I fervently and fruitlessly wished to be a part of.And my adult self was just as enchanted as my inner child was. Sure,A Wrinkle in Timehas its faults but I honestly couldn't tell you what they are because I was so thoroughly entertained, so taken with these characters I couldn't believe I could relate to in a way that was far less remote and removed than I expected (which is to say, at all) that all the things my nitpicky, pretentious post-English-major self would usually hone in on paled in comparison to the sheer enjoyment of the rush of letting a book completely suck me into its world to the point where the real world could have collapsed around me and I wouldn't've either cared or noticed because I was so wrapped up in this story.On one hand, yeah, I do feel a little cheated that so much of what I needed to hear as a kid has lived within these pages all this time and I could have had such imperatives by my side to ease the pains of childhood's harsh but necessary learning experiences had I just shown even a fraction of some interest in this book. Among them: One's parents are not infallible. Weaknesses can become strengths -- nay, tools integral to besting some truly harrowing obstacles -- in the right circumstances. That sometimes you have to face down scary or unpleasant truths, and you're not excused from looking away or backing down just because the task ahead is either scary or unpleasant. It's better to embrace your individuality and not compromise yourself, no matter how uncomfortable you are in your own skin, than to mindlessly submit to the herd mentality and easy conformity. Just because something appears strange doesn't make it bad -- or all that strange at its core, after all. What things are is infinitely more important than what they look like.But conversely? This book drenched my ordinary existence with fantasy's magic for a few days, and I'm sure it'll stick with me in the days to come. My first encounter with this book wasn't a foggily but fondly recalled childhood memory that's destined to be tarnished by the darkening cynicism of the years upon revisits from my older self. I got to experience the breathless wonder of a kid discovering an instant favorite for that very first time as an oasis of sheer escapist rapture in the face of a few intense work days and the humdrum nature of routine adulthood. And it proved to me that I don't always have to be such a goddamn snob about kid lit because when it's good, it is extraordinary. (And, really, let's be honest: Younger Me wasn't exactly the sharpest crayon in the tool shed, so who's to say I would have picked up on the more subtle elements that made this such a delightful read, anyway?)Despite my natural inclination toward hyperbole, I am not exaggerating when I say I'm a little better for having read this book, one that I initially arrived at out of dubious curiosity and left in a state of giddy, childlike awe. And maybe a few tears."

Yet, I was very pleasantly surprised, and I'm even more excited to see the new movie adaptation in March! I mean, this reads a little \"old\" and \"simple\" but it was still such a delight to read. I will say that I didn't remember any of the religious/spiritual aspects that were woven in, so apparently fifth grade Melanie, who went to a Catholic school and everything, just pushed those out of her mind throughout the years.The basic premise ofA Wrinkle in Time, that I'm sure you all know, stars a young girl named Meg is one of four siblings in her family, and both of her parents are scientists. Meg and Charles are very intelligent, therefore outcasts, but where their twin siblings, who are of normal IQ, fit in just fine. One day, her father goes missing and Meg, Charles, and their new friend, Calvin, meet a very peculiar trio, who take them on an intergalactic adventure that they will never forget. They essentially travel by folding or \"wrinkling\" time.Overall, this was a super enjoyable read, that totally did give me a swift kick in the nostalgia feels. Yet, I'm not sure how well it would hold up if this was your first time experiencing the story. I do feel like there is a little something here for everyone, and even though this is considered a middle grade book, I do think it holds up pretty well for most ages. And honestly? Even reading this in 2018, this is still a very unique book.\"There will no longer be so many pleasant things to look at if responsible people do not do something about the unpleasant ones.\"This is a story about love, and family, and faith, and being able to think for yourself. I can totally understand why this is a literary classic, and I'm so happy I reread it! And now I'm totally pumped for the movie!Blog|Twitter|Tumblr|Instagram|Youtube|TwitchValentine's Day buddy (re)read with the beautifulWren! ❤"

I will not disrespect this book by saying anything negative about it. I think my opinions about this book may have changed over the years, but that by no means makes this a poor read. Instead of being critical about the book, I am going to celebrate it with some of my favorite quotes from this book:\"Like and equal are not the same thing at all.\"(No wonder this book is considered to be allegorical! Definitely some political innuendo there..)\"Have you ever tried to get to your feet with a sprained dignity?\"\"A book, too, can be a star, \"explosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly,\" a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.\"If we knew ahead of time what was going to happen we'd be—we'd be like the people on Camazotz, with no lives of our own, with everything all planned and done for us.\"And for my absolute favorite quote:\"Life, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself. - Mrs. Whatsit\"This book is a masterpiece. However, it simply didn't resonate with my older self as it had with my younger self. With that said, I can still recognize this for what it was: A book ahead of its time that was extremely controversial. It has seen much success and has been exulted by fans everywhere."

        "user_review": "Wow! I never imagine to read this book for the first time when I'm in my 40s. For years I let the book get lost in my chubby TBR that keeps growing at each day. Probably it stuck with piles of books and I wouldn't remember to read it if Ted Lasso wouldn't give this book to Roy Kent! If a book can heal one of the grumpiest fictional characters' soul, it may surely help me, too. At least that's what I thought before I started.Overall: I loved the classic theme: three children's teaming up for fighting against evil darkness threatening the universe.I liked how 13 years old Meg portrayed and little, enigmatic brother Charles. As their fellow schoolmate Calvin joins them with the guidance of their weird neighbors with weirder names Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, Mrs. Witch, two children's search for missing father turns into a visit to fifth dimension to confront with the universal threat!Yeap, I enjoyed it a lot and I'm so happy to skip the movie adaptations! I wish I read it sooner but better late than never!Here are my favorite quotes:\"Life, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself. - Mrs. Whatsit\"\"We can't take any credit for our talents. It's how we use them that counts.\"\"The only way to cope with something deadly serious is to try to treat it a little lightly \"\"A book, too, can be a star, \"explosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly,\" a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.\""

Have I been living under a rock my entire life?This was utterly DELIGHTFUL, Amazing, Funny, Scary, Brilliant & Crazy Bold. In short, I loved it. Ok, and I admit, I didn't read it. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Hope Davis - and she was amazing. That being said, thank you Madeiline L'Engle, - \"A Wrinkle in TIme\" was mystical, magical and nothing short of fantastical.Thirteen year-old Meg Murry and her little brother, Charles Wallace end up going on a little trip.. (without their Mum or their siblings), to the 5th dimension. Mind you, they don't go alone. They go with Mrs. What-Its, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch and a young man named Calvin. Yes, the 5th dimension exists my friends and the trip takes a mere second or two (see, I knew it!). It's a terrifying trip, yet they go nonetheless. Why do they go you ask? To find and save Meg's father, a scientist, who has been trapped on Camazotz for years. With help of Calvin, Mrs. What's Its, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch and a friend she encounters named Aunt Beast, Meg is sent off to do the impossible.Camazotz is an evil planet however, and Camazotz is being controlled by \"IT\" (not Stephen King's \"IT\" mind you), and IT controls everyone and everything and if IT gets control of you, there is no getting free. Finding the strength to fight IT takes something special. It takes something that is inside of everyone who is human. Meg just has to find it.\"A Wrinkle in Time\" surprised me. I didn't have any idea how much I would love it. It was amusing, frightening, intense, intelligent, oh so magical. I simply adored it. I wanted to get to it before the movie came out in a few months and I am so glad I did. If for some reason, you are like me and have never read it, I highly recommend you either read or listen to the audiobook. You will not be sorry. A Wrinkle in Time will leave you breathless. One minute a huge smile will break out on your face, and you will be grinning from ear to ear and then next you will be clenching your teeth, scared for Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin, hoping against hope that all will turn out ok.Published on Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 10.15.17."

        "user_review": "Madeleine L'Engleis a Christian writer, more so even thanC. S. Lewisin my opinion. However, while the influence of Christian Theology (and in later books, biblical history) is woven throughly through out all the books in this series, it is not offensive to non-Christian readers. I am one of those.To be completely honest, when my mother first read me this when I was about 7 years old, I was totally oblivious to the influence L'Engle's faith has on her writing. It wasn't until I was twelve or thirteen, when I read the entire series several times over, that it became obvious to me.But I digress. What really makes this book (and others in the series) has nothing directly to do with the writer's faith. It has to do with the different types of non-sexual love found between family, friends, society, and the individual. I know, big thing for a Children's novel, but it generally is shown rather then told thereby allowing young children to learn by example.Going back to the faith thing for half a second, it's like a large parable for how the New Testament (Protestant Christian, any how) advises people to form relationships and maintain them. We are to love and respect our parents, even when the world doesn't. Meg believes in and loves her father, even though he has some odd theories and has been missing for years. We are to care after our siblings regardless of personal quibbles, again like Meg and her brothers. WE are to show compassion for our neighbors despite what other members of our society think (See Calvin's friendship with Meg and Charles) and To care for them even though it might mean personal risk, as in some of the later scenes. Over all, it demonstrates a non-sexual love as one of the most powerful forces in the Universe. And this is a moral lesson that every faith can embrace."

        "user_review": "I just finished reading this for the first time since, maybe college? Twelve year old Meg Murry, her precocious five year old brother Charles Wallace, and their new friend Calvin meet some highly odd beings who call themselves Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which. This strange, quirky trio sweeps the children away on an interstellar quest to find and rescue Meg and Charles Wallace's missing father. They fold space and time through tesseracts (the \"wrinkle\" in time and space) and battle the darkness that has taken over other planets and shadows ours.This 1962 book is noticeably old-fashioned and a little simplistic in several ways. The symbolism and the links to religion and scriptures aren't subtle, and Meg's anger and stubbornness gets old, though it's interesting to see how those character traits can in some situations stand her in good stead. Also, in fairness it is a middle grade book, though a lot of older readers love it. There's something really lovely about the book's ultimate message and themes. I enjoyed revisiting it again after all these years.I'm going to stick with my original 4 star rating, though I'm pretty sure that the nostalgia factor is playing into this rating. Full review to come!January 2018 buddy read with the Pantaloonless group.Original post:I read this book at least two or three times when I was a teen/young adult (actually, I own and have read the entire series), but it's been a long while since I last read this. I'm interested to see how it holds up!"

        "user_review": "I started reading \"A Wrinkle In Time\" when I was 8 or 10. I say started because I never finished it. I can't remember exactly why, but I think it kind of scared the crap out of me. Now, 15 or 17 years later, I've read it again (this time the whole thing) and there's really nothing scary at all about it. It's possible that, as a kid, I was somehow relating this book to the terribly scary Disney movie \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\". Again, I don't know why.Whatever the reason for my fears, the book is not spectacular. Maybe I can't see it now being older and not reading through the eyes of a child, but I can't understand how it won the John Newberry Medal. The witches were plastic and seemed to serve little purpose; the bad guy, a concept embodied in a shadow, had no motivation (if you want to read about true darkness for the sake of darkness/nothing for the sake of nothing, pick up Michael Ende's \"The Neverending Story\"); and the father, who seems to have no backbone and no sense of decency when it comes to saving his son. It has been said that the father character is an excellent tool in showing children that parents do not always have the answers, that they are, in fact, fallible and (God forbid) imperfect. But it's so much more than that. He comes across as weak, helpless, foolish, and even heartless at times. If you want to write a story where a child finds out that his/her parents aren't perfect, you don't have to make the parental figure a cold, bumbling idiot. Unless that's what you're going for. And I certainly don't think that L'Engle was. But all that aside, why would you even want to tell that story? Part of the beauty of being a child is you get to hold onto the illusion that mom and dad are Superman. Why ruin that? Granted, some kids live in terrible families, but there are better ways to write about those scenarios. This is not it.I wanted to give this book 2 stars but decided that, because of my jaded, critical age I cannot judge too harshly. Plus, I did like the savant character of Charles Wallace. He was cute. As was the love that Meg and him shared. Calvin, on the other hand, was a complete throwaway character.If I had kids, would I push this book on them? No. If they picked it off my bookshelf and started reading it, I wouldn't stop them. But I'm not about to recommend it to anyone young or old. Unless it's too ask that person to help me understand what the big deal is."

        "user_review": "About: A Wrinkle in Time is a children's science fiction written by Madeleine L'Engle. It was published on 3/15/1973 by Yearling Books, paperback, 211 pages. The genres are children's, science fiction, and fantasy. This book is intended for readers ages 10 to 14. This book belongs to a series of 5 books.My Experience: I started reading A Wrinkle in Time on 3/13/18 and finished it on 3/16/18. This book is fantastic! I love the characters! They all have unique personalities. I like the twin's good sense of humor. I like their easy going intelligent parents and the oddities of Meg and Charles Wallace. I like that despite the characters being super smart, that they seem to have a disability in others. Charles Wallace is a genius but he didn't speak until he was 4 years old. Meg is excellent at math but she is a trouble student at school. It's a good reminder that even geniuses are still not perfect. I read this book to watch the remake of A Wrinkle in Time. I have seen the old version of the movie years ago and some events came back to me as I read this book.This book is told in the third person point of view following Margaret (Meg) Murry as she experiences one of the lowest days of her life. Her grades are suffering, the mean girls at school are saying she's acting like a baby, and she has gotten herself into a fight to protect her youngest brother, Charles Wallace though her middle twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys weren't appreciative of her efforts. Now the storm is scaring her. The storm brought in one of their new strange neighbors, Mrs. Whatsit. To Meg and her mom's surprise, Charles Wallace already gotten acquainted with the new neighbor. Mrs. Whatsit said a tesseract is real and it brought on a whole new adventure for Meg and Charles Wallace. This adventure involves rescuing their father, a renowned physicist. With the help of Mrs. Whatsit and her two friends Mrs.Which and Mrs. Who and Meg's classmate, Calvin, they were able to travel by tesser to far away planets.A well written story, this book is full of adventures and wholesome characters for readers. I love the illustrations in this book that explains how traveling through tesser works. I like the mathematical references and the mentioning of Einstein. I like how Meg's dad spent time to teach Meg math shortcuts and the periodic table of elements. I like Charles Wallace and his interest in higher learning at such a young age. I like the glimpse of Camazotz's citizens, how everyone doing the same thing in a rhythmic motion. This book has a good family dynamic and the curiosity of the mind and I highly recommend everyone to read this book!Pro: fast paced, page turner, easy to read, family oriented, other planets,Con: noneI rate it 5 stars!***Disclaimer: I borrowed this book from my local public library and my opinions are honest.xoxo,Jasmine atwww.howusefulitis.wordpress.comfor more details"

I do not comprehend the downer delivered byeveryone and her little dogon this film. Can't be misogyny, the character was always a girl; so that leaves...mm hmm...racism. A black woman behind the camera, a lovely and talented young one as Meg. Must have fits and fall in 'em! \"It's not like the book!\" Umm...it's a movie...and guess what? It's a lot closer than y'all let on. It's a decent film and it wouldn't have been *possible* to get this close in a live-action film until this century. I've now watched it twice and from my very informed perspective as a reader and a filmgoer, lots and lots of information and criticism absorbed and debated, this is a fine film and more faithful to the book than anyone had any reason to expect.Rating: 4* of fiveThe Publisher Says: It was a dark and stormy night; Meg Murry, her small brother Charles Wallace, and her mother had come down to the kitchen for a midnight snack when they were upset by the arrival of a most disturbing stranger.\"Wild nights are my glory,\" the unearthly stranger told them. \"I just got caught in a downdraft and blown off course. Let me be on my way. Speaking of way, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.\"Meg's father had been experimenting with this fifth dimension of time travel when he mysteriously disappeared. Now the time has come for Meg, her friend Calvin, and Charles Wallace to rescue him. But can they outwit the forces of evil they will encounter on their heart-stopping journey through space?My Review: Meg Murry's daddy left home unexpectedly and without saying goodbye. The adored parent left behind an adolescent daughter, three sons, and a beautiful and smart wife. Meg cannot make herself get used to his absence and can't even pretend that she's not hurt by the town's opinion that he ran off leaving her mother. This, plus braces, wildly curly hair, an intelligence far greater than her contemporaries', and glasses, isolate the girl with her even weirder little brother Charles Wallace against their normal brothers and the rest of the world.In time-honored tradition, these misfits are actually being prepared to fight the ultimate battle of Good Versus Evil, no pressure on the children no no no, and save their Daddy, not like it's gettin' piled even higher oh no! One fine day, Meg and Charles Wallace are called to their destiny by Mrs Which, Mrs Who, and Mrs Whatsit, the eccentric old ladies who prove to be avatars of interdimensional good beings with the agenda of making the Universe safe for goodness and happiness again.The children are joined by fellow misfit Calvin, a popular boy athlete in their town whose hidden depths have tormented him all his life, in the quest to make the evil entity, a disembodied brain called \"IT,\" that slowly takes over planets and compels all life thereon to submit to being in a group mind, erasing individuality and leaching away happiness.This is a YA novel, so all turns out well, with Mr. Murry coming home and the children being brought home all safe and sound. But how they get home is very interesting: They travel via tesseract, a geometric figure that extends into a fifth dimension beyond spacetime. Mr. and Mrs. Murry have been researching this in their roles as scientists, and Mr. Murry has used the tesseract to get to the planet from which he's rescued. The Mrs Who/Which/Whatsit interdimensional beings use the tesseract to \"tesser\" or wrinkle the fabric of spacetime to get the children there as well.Fascinating stuff for a Christian housewife to be writing about in 1960-1961! And make no mistake, the book is a very Christianity-infested Message about the perils of brains without hearts leading to Communistic group-think. Mrs. Murry, a capable scientist, stays home with the kiddos and makes dinner over Bunsen burners so she can keep working while she stays home to be a wife and mom. Ew.And Meg, poor lamb, worries that she's not pretty enough because she needs braces and glasses and she's not all gorgeous like her mom is. Then Calvin, a popular boy and an athlete, shows hidden depths and falls for little Meg. So bells ring, doves coo, and hands are held, so all is well. Ew.But it ain'tTwilight, so I'm good with it. In fact, because I first read it before I was ten, I'm good with all of it. The stiff, unrealistic dialogue, the socially regressive and reprehensible messages, the religiosity...all get a benign half-smile and an indulgent wink.Because sometimes you just need to know thatsomeoneout there believes that good CAN triumph over evil."

The decently rounded characters seemed to be floating in spartan landscapes like portraits hung in limbo.Lackluster description is one thing, but perhaps more than anything, I think my tepid-3 star, ho-hum reaction toA Wrinkle in Timeis due to my reading it as a middle-aged curmudgeon. It's made for kids and I haven't been one of them in a while.My wifelovedthis book as a child and kept hinting I should read it, hinting so much that the hints became ultimatums. Could've sworn I heard her in my head shouting, \"Read this or you do not love me!\" So I read it and well...meh. I missed the age-appropriate boat on that one, I guess. But hey, at least I was smart enough not to give her my scathing review (yes, this would've been seen as a scathing review in her eyes). I just said, \"It was nice,\" and that's the story of how I managed to stay married.The End"

All the books she had ever read were lined up inside her mind like a huge library. And there was Mrs Whatsit, moving through the shelves with her, pulling down a book here and a book there...\"You see?\" asked Mrs Whatsit after a time. \"That was quite easy, wasn't it? I'm sureOut of the Silent Planetwill be useful, and of courseThat Hideous Strength. Good old C.S. Lewis! And Olaf Stapledon'sStar Maker. We want that lovely dance of the stars, don't we? Then we'll take Charles Wallace out ofOdd John, and I think some Robert Heinlein and just alittlebit of Plato, and now all you have to do is put them together!\"A moment later, Madeleine found herself sitting in front of her typewriter. The words poured out of her, as she covered sheet after sheet. More quickly than she would have believed possible, she found there was a thick manuscript on the desk. Dazed and astonished, she picked it up and began to read through what she had written.\"But it's terrible!\" she said, in bitter disappointment. \"So sloppily constructed! Such a lack of feeling for the English language! And it doesn't even make sense! None of it sticks together!\"\"Goddag, yxskaft,\"agreed Mrs Who. \"Hello, ax-handle. Swedish.

        "user_review": "We all want to fit in somehow. We also want to be ourselves and thus stand out a little bit, but basically we don't want to deviate too much from \"the norm\" because it's usually considered bad by others (funny, considering that we're pretty much all feeling the same way so we should just let the others be) and especially children often have a hard time when not fitting in with their peers. Thus, being different can be risky.Meg is a girl that doesn't fit in. Her parents are multiple PhDs and have taught her and her siblings a thing or two (about maths mostly) with the result that Meg can often not understand why she is supposed to solve a (mathematical) problem in school this way instead of that. The problem is that neither her teachers nor the other kids in school are thrilled with what her parents have already taught her and she is therefore subject to verbal bullying from both groups.Meg has three brothers: twins (Sandy and Dennys) and Charles Wallace. The former two know how to play the game and usually don't let anything get to them. The latter is 5 years old and usually doesn't speak at all because he knows full well that his correct and adult way of speaking - to say nothing of knowing peoples' minds - would freak others out. He prefers letting them think he cannot speak and is \"dumb\". He's also Meg's confidant and (thanks to his ability) always knows what she and their mother need.The children live in a house with their mother who conducts experiments in a room off the kitchen. Sadly, the childrens' father has been missing for over a year, leaving the family emotionally desperate. He worked with the government and there isn't any information the family is given by way of explanation. The cruel people of town speak about him having left for another woman, which doesn't make Meg feel any better, of course. In fact, Meg hates people for being so unfair and ignorant and she frequently grows impatient with the way things are (leading to her getting into trouble).Thanks to her gifted brother Charles Wallace, the family encounters a peculiar old woman called Mrs. Whatsit. The following day, Meg and Charles Wallace not only meet Mrs. Whatsit's sister (Mrs. Who) but also a boy from school - a popular boy, Calvin, who nevertheless seems to have enough troubles of his own and reveals to only be popular because he is what everyone expects of him without it really being him.To go into such detail about the children is important to me because they are the central characters. Sure, Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who are important as well and the kids meet other creatures besides them, but the author managed to truly write a story for and about children.Anyway, at one point, the three ladies reveal to Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin that they want to help getting back Meg's and Charles Wallace's father because he is in great peril. Thus, they take them on a fantastic journey through several galaxies.It's a tale of all your faults being necessary at the right time if you can apply them properly, of perseverance, love, and self-sacrifice. It's about the darkness in the world and that we can't simply do nothing, even if that might seem seductively easier. It's also about celebrating who you are instead of homogenizing the entire world.Camazotz, a world the children travel to while trying to find their father, is the perfect example of what happens when everyone has to be like everybody else. Not only does it make the world grey and dull, it also does not make the people in it happy.This is definitely a tale I'd read to my children if I had any, because it teaches so much about people, the world, perception, and looking beyond the surface. It's also about compassion and intelligence and hard lessons that all people need to learn at one point in their lives or another and the author had a wonderful way of not only delighting me when I travelled to distant planets with the children, but of also breaking my heart once or twice.I loved the prose, I loved the author's imagination, I loved the children and everyone they encountered for the colourful worlds they inhabited and their strangeness. I loved how the interaction of light and dark was portrayed, how our way of seeing the world was challenged, and the fact that the book was filled with scientific topics, explained so children could understand them. In the introduction to my edition, the author said that the book had been rejected many times, usually because nobody could tell what it was (it was as different as its main characters) and the publishers said that children would never \"get it\" - to which the author commented that children usually perceive much more than adults, and her own children (demanding more writing from her) were proof enough for her to persevere. I therefore love her self-imposed high standard to make this a tale for children, about children, that nevertheless equally thrills thanks to the adventure and educates through the imbedded facts. It is rather fascinating even though there are plenty of religious themes embedded as well (though much more subtly than C.S. Lewis did in most of his books).I have the audiobook that was read by Hope Davis and was delighted about her narration. I've listened to a number of audiobooks lately but she must be one of the top 3 narrators I've heard so far and I hope she's narrated the rest of the series as well.Because this is a quintet and while you could technically regard this as a standalone, it literally ends in the middle of a sentence from Mrs. Whatsit which caught me by complete surprise and left me wanting more (nice touch). *lol*"

A Wrinkle in Time was the book I would read as a kid when I was in a bad mood or bored or just because I wanted to get wrapped up in the magic of another world. I read A Wrinkle in Time for the first time in second grade and it made me fall in love with reading. Of course I liked to read before then but this book turned me into the voracious reader I am today. So as I said before I was scared to reread this book after all these years given how much it meant to my childhood. I worried I wouldn't like it and I didn't want to destroy the memory of this book.So how do I feel after rereading it?I didn't love it as much as I did when I was a child but that was an impossible bar to reach. I have to admit I was very confused for the majority of the book. I don't know how I understood this book as a 8 year old when I could barely keep up as a 32 year old. I'm glad I reread it and I'm glad I didn't hate it. My childhood memories remain intact. Had this been my first time reading my rating would have been lower(2.5-3 stars) but since I probably wouldn't be the reader I am today or the woman I am today without this book 4 stars seems a fitting rating.The Bookbum Bookclub2018 Bookriot Read Harder Challenge: A Children's Classic Published Before 1980Around the year in 52 books: A book from Amazon's 100 books to read in a lifetime2018 Popsugar Reading Challenge: a book with an ugly cover."

But I also had those weird insights in ways not quite as dramatic as Charles Wallace, so I was all of those kids. And my Dad worked all the time, maybe not on another planet, but far enough away for my Mom to run the household, minus the science experiments and liverwurst-and-cream cheese sandwiches."

I did read it when I wasn't always writing reviews, so here is a brief take on what I remember . . .I had high hopes for this one because it is considered a classic. Many people read this one when they are in elementary/middle school and I remember back when I was that age hearing my fellow students singing its praises. A bit odd that I never tried it back then! When I finally got to it as an adult, those hopes I had built up were not lived up to.Maybe if I had read it as a kid I would have felt different. But, to adult me it was just a bizarre and haphazard series of events - and not in a good way. I struggled to stay interested or even be able to tell what was going on. I do remember that since it is highly revered I fought my hardest to find something that I enjoyed about it.You shouldn't have to fight to enjoy something if it is truly meant for you.So, it is not one that I can recommend, but I am glad many love it and have fond memories of it."

        "user_review": "I expected to really like this book. Its won several awards, and over the years I've always heard generally good things about it.So what happened?Truthfully, it's hard to pinpoint exactly. To explain in broad strokes, I just never connected with the story. There seemed to be little, if any, internal logic to the events that happen. There is no reason why the children are burdened with such a delicate \"life or death\" task that they could easily screw up. There's no reason why they are \"helped\" until the very end, where they are suddenly supposed to be able to solve some hokey battle of wits to survive and rescue someone.The characters are almost as unlikable as the thin plot. Meg, the oldest child, complains incessantly and is scared the whole time. Her little brother, Charles Wallace, is interesting because of his strange ability to feel what someone's thinking, but it's never explained why he is like this. He seems way too precocious for his age, even for someone with his ability. Calvin, the random kid thrown into the story for seemingly no reason at all, has zero personality and exists solely to hold Meg's hand every time she's scared (which is all the time) and to boost her fragile ego with a few compliments.Like a lot of young adult fiction,A Wrinkle in Timefalls into the trap of pitting an absolute \"good\" versus an absolute \"evil.\" However, even this cosmic battle of good and evil is poorly defined. Examples of people who are fighting the \"good\" fight, according to the story, are Jesus, Buddah, and Gandhi. The \"bad\" is represented by a dark cloud and an extra-dimensional being called \"It\" who controls an entire planet of people like some 1950's cartoon version of a brainwashing socialistic dictatorship. I found it strange that the most evil thing that entire galaxies are fighting against does not desire chaos, power, or bloodshed, but a passive mind control through which its victims sacrifice individuality for equality. Wow, that's...so...evil? It's like reading Red Scare propaganda from the 1950's.L'Engle kills the tone of this story by peppering the narrative with strange, out-of-place declarations of Christian belief. For a story that seems largely secular, the odd Bible quotes and religious one-sidedness felt out of place. In a world where an unseen God can murder all of humanity with a flood and wind up on the \"good\" list, while an egalitarian dictator who asserts its will without killing anyone is on the \"evil\" list, sign me up for the latter.I could never get into this story. There were okay bits here and there, but nothing cohesive enough to matter. At least it was refreshing to read a YA book where the parents aren't dead. Most of the time it seems a kid can't have any fun in literature unless their parents have kicked the bucket.Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more as a child, but as an adult who has read a lot of fiction, this felt like it was slapped together without and real meaning or direction."

        "user_review": "I read this as a young man and was disappointed. It didn't work for me. I thought it was about a crazy old man gone off the reservation, picking a fight with an innocent fish while ranting about the New York Yankees (\"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing. They say his father was a fisherman...\").I picked it up again, after the passage of some years, and found it incredibly poignant.It's a simple story. There's an old man, Santiago, who is a fisherman fallen on hard times. He is cared for by a young boy, Manolin, who no longer works on his boat. Santiago goes into the Gulf and engages in the fight of his life with a giant marlin. What follows is a dream-like, stream-of-conscious meditation as the old man matches strength and wits with the great fish.After 84 days of no fish, Santiago takes his skiff far out to sea. He drops his line and hooks a marlin. He can't pull it in, so he takes hold of the line, beginning the back and forth: when the marlin runs, he gives the line slack; when the marlin is still, he pulls the line in. The old man's hands are cut by the rope. His muscles strain. He has no food or water. Yet he doesn't give up. The obsession has shades ofMoby Dick, except at the end of this novel, I didn't feel the need to dig up Melville and punch him in the skull:I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars. Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs away. . . . Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. . . . There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavior and his great dignity. I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.Eventually, the marlin is hauled in and killed. The old man attaches him to the boat, and begins to row towards shore. Of course, the marlin is dripping blood, so if you've seenJawsor readJames and the Giant Peach, you can imagine that his dreams of hitting it big with this fish are probably not going to come to pass.Age teaches you a lot of things. You start to realize that you might never be the person you thought you'd be as a child. Days go by, you start to lose more and gain less. I thought about this as I thought about the old man, raging like Dylan Thomas against the night; an old man nearing the end of his days fighting against nature, time, death, a fish, able to boil all things down into one climatic struggle on the high seas. At the end, he did not succeed, at least not in the manner he'd foreseen, but he was, in an inimitable way, victorious.'You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food,' he thought. 'You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?'"

        "user_review": "Oh, my good lord in heaven. Cut your line, land your boat and go to McDonald's! Just as in the case of The Great Gatsby, I understand the book. Yes, I know it changed the way American writers write. I also understand that it celebrates the ridiculous American idea that you're only a REAL man if you've done something entirely purposeless, but really dangerous, in pursuit of making yourself look like the bull with the biggest sexual equipment. Get over it, already! Go home and clean out the refrigerator, or wash the curtains, or vacuum under the furniture. Pick your kids up from school or take your daughter bra shopping. THAT would impress me. Being too dumb to cut your fishing line? Not the mate I would pick...The only bright spot about the book is if you think of it on a metaphorical level: there is a point at which ALL of us must grit our teeth and hold on in the face of despair. That is the definition of life. However, if that's the point, then the plot situation needs to be one of necessity (like the shipwreck in Life of Pi), instead of stubbornness.************It's been a while since I wrote this review, and there's a lot of amusing speculation in the comments people have attached. I have to say, they crack me up. Here's my final word on reviewing on Goodreads (or anywhere); One of the most important elements of reading is that it allows each of us to react in the way we need to react, without judgment, as we experience the book. This is how I reacted to The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway is dead, or I wouldn't have been so up-front with my opinion. He's not insulted, I understand that we all need goals in life, and I've been happily married for a LONG time. Now take a deep breath and smile. Life is too short to be anxious about picayune stuff like this."

        "user_review": "Myvery firsttime readingPapaand I absolutelyLOVED IT. Sometimes the experience you have with a book can be effected by many things beyond the narrative itself, and I think that is certainly the case here. While I believe I would have loved this story regardless, there is no doubt that the stars aligned themselves perfectly to make this a singularly special read for me.Let me explain...Last year, I was in Napa with my wife and two of our best friends celebrating my (oh shit!!) 40th birthday. It was the latter part of October (near the end of harvest time) and the weather was perfect...DUH, it's Napa.We were staying at our favorite Napa sanctuary, the Villagio Inn and Spa.Though pricey, Vellagio is just about perfect, it's centrally located, with wonderful rooms, and one of the BEST breakfast spreads in the world...Hey, when you are going out drinking all day, it is important to load up on foodstuffs to avoid alcohol-related trouble. have a nice big breakfast before you go out and drink all day...it is called beingpractical.Speaking of drinking all day, we had just come back from an awesome tour of theCastle di Amarossa Winerywhich is, I shit you not, a real castle in the middle of Napa, California...…complete withMEGA DINING HALL...and aTORTURE CHAMBER…..yep, a rack, an Iron Maiden and some device that made me constipated just looking at it....Anyway, we got back to the room and had a few hours to relax before a late dinner reservation. Well, I don't sleep all that much and so, while my wife took a nap (light weight that she is), I decided I would find something fairly short to read. I choose this story because it was only 100 pages long (or just under 3 hours via audio) and it seemed to fit my time allotment perfectly.So, feeling a little buzzed and in a superb, yet contemplative mood (I had just turned 40 for crying out loud), I poured myself another glass of wine (shut up and don't judge me), went and sat on the balcony outside our room and, with the sun starting to go down, began listening to the audio version of this story.Well, this story slammed me and had me sucked in and captive from the very first words:\"He was the old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.\"By the way, now would be a good time to mention that the audio version I listened to was read by Donald Sutherland, and the marriage of the story with Sutherland's perfect narration was nothing short of magical. In my opinion it is THE ONLY VERSION of the audio book that should be sold.As many have said (and almost as many have complained), this is in many ways a simple story about an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago, who has had a significant run of bad luck fishing (i.e., 84 days).\"Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the \nsame color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\"Attempting to change his luck, he decides to take his skiff further out than he has ever gone before, \"beyond all the people of the world.\" Eventually, he lands the largest Marlin he's ever seen and the bulk of the narrative details his epic struggle to reel in the fish and get it back to shore.Yes, a simple story and Hemingway uses sparse, straight-forward prose...and devastates with them. The most powerful emotions, passions and struggles that people experience are often tied to the most basic needs and the most elemental aspects of who they are. I felt an immediate connection to the story and was deeply moved by the restrained, yet palpable power of the narrative.The most lasting message that I took away from the story was that, despite the many hardships Santiago faces, and the titanic trials that he endures on the open sea, INEVER ONCEfelt that I was supposed to pity or feel sorry for him in any way. Here was a person doing what he loves to do, what gives him purpose in life, and struggling with an iron will to accomplish his goal. The struggle is hard, it is difficult, but it is who he is and what gives him fulfillment in life. All I could feel was giant admiration for this man.I found this uplifting and a powerful reaffirmation of what is truly important in life.\"But a man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed \nbut not defeated.\"Whether it was the setting I was in, the mood I was in, the wine I was drinking, the wonderful narration or the power of the words themselves, in the end the result was the same. I felt ALIVE, and for that I say thank you \"Papa\" wherever you are!!!That is basically it, but I wanted to leave you with my favorite line from the story, one that I think encapsulates everything Hemingway set out to accomplish in his tale.\"And what beat you, he thought. 'Nothing,' he said aloud. \n'I went out too far.'\"5.0 stars and one of my \"All Time\" favorites. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"

        "user_review": "It is intimidating to offer a truly critical look at such a classic, so we will ease into it with a few images.The GOP has offered us a ready-made item to begin this list, and yes, I know that John Stewart already snagged this one and threw it back.I turned up a visual art concept that fits in, for a restaurant based on EH themes:Although I did not sit for this photo, the resemblance is indeed strikingAnd, of courseThe Old Man and the Cee Lo.Isupposeam certain there are plenty more images one might lure into our net, but sticking to words for a bit, we will pass on the porn offering, The Old Man and the Semen. How about the moving tale of a Navy Construction veteran, The Old Man and the Seabees, or an obstetrical episode of Grey's Anatomy, The Old Man and the C-Section. Then there might be a psychological drama about a man with bipolar disorder, The Old Man and the See Saw, or a book about an elderly acupuncturist, The Old Man and the Chi. How about a Disney adventure in which Paul Hogan rescues a pinniped, yes, gentle reader, The Old Man and the Seal. Maybe a bit of Cuban self-affirmation, The Old Man and the Si. I could go on, of course, and probably will, at home, until my wife threatens to leave. The possibilitiesarerather endless. But the Geneva Conventions might be brought into play, and we can't have that. Tackling such a review head on seems, somehow, wrong, like using paint by number to copy the Mona Lisa, carving the Pieta out of gigantic blocks of cheddar, writing a love poem for your beloved using MadLibs orYes, the forces ofrighteousnesssanity wanted this one deep-sixed:…checking for skid marks on Ghandi's dhoti. Ok, 12-year-old inner me is all giggly now.At some point, though, I guess you have to, you know, fish or cut bait.I struggled mightily with this one, finding a hook, then having it pull away, grabbing hold of an idea and watching it disappear beneath waves of uncertainty. I tried waiting a while, resting between attempts, losing myself in other contemplations. Smiling a bit, but always hoping for something I could finally yank aboard. Notions of religious connections, Papa's personal philosophy, and story-telling technique all pulled in diverse directions. As you will see, it was a not a simple contest. And I am not certain that what I ultimately caught is all that filling.He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finallysalao, which is the worst form of unlucky.So opensThe Old Man and the Sea, the book, we hear tell, that convinced the Nobel committee to reel in EGH with the biggest literary hook of them all. Santiago is an old, unlucky, but skilled Cuban fisherman. He has an able assistant, the young Manolin. The lad is not a blood relation, but he sees a father figure in the old man, and he may be a younger reflection of the old man himself. Maybe Santiago sees himself in the young man and takes some strength from that. Like the best sort of father, he teaches the boy to fish rather than fishing for him. But Santiago's ill fortune has marked him as someone to be avoided and Manolin's parents have put the kibosh on their professional association. The old man is determined to salvage his reputation, and his honor, and bring in some money by going farther out than the other fishermen are willing to sail, in search of redemption. No herald calls him to action. No dramatic event sparks him to excessive risk. It is an internal challenge that powers his engines. But it is a quest nonetheless on which Santiago embarks.Any time there are fish involved, one might presume a degree of soul saving. I do not know enough Hemingway to have a take on whether or not that figured here. I raise it only as a passing thought. But the second sentence of the book offers a hint. \"In the first forty days…\"clearly places Santiago's travails alongside another person who spent forty days in a different barren environment. It was after being baptized that Jesus spent his time in the desert, preparing for what awaited. Is Santiago to be tested here? Will he be offered a route away from his difficult path?The waters are becalmed. Nothing moves. A moment, then, for a digression. OK, let's try some simple arithmetic, if Jesus, at age 30, spent 40 days in the desert, and Santiago has gone 84 days in his version of the desert, just how old is the old man? 63, according to my calculations. Possible. I do not recall seeing an actual age noted, so I am gonna go with that. I know you guys will let me know if an actual age is revealed somewhere and my squinty geezer eyes missed it. Done. I can feel a slight breeze beginning to flutter the sail.Some sort of religion seems to flow through this fish tale. Not only are we sprinkled with forty-day references, but Santiago discusses sin. In his struggles he suffers physical damage in which some might see an echo of Calvary. But I think that is a stretch, personally. So, we have a bit of religion, and a quest. What is Santiago questing for? Redemption would fit in nicely. Having failed for a long time, he feels a need to redeem himself in the eyes of his community. Maybe not a religious thing, per se, but swimming in the same waters. And speaking of religion, water as a baptismal element is always a possibility, although somewhat diluted here, as Santiago makes his living on the water.The old man is strong, skilled and determined. Maybe it is his character that is at issue. Maybe somehow, taking on this challenge is a way to prove to himself that he is truly a man. He goes about his business, and his fishing is his fate, maybe even his life. It is in how he handles himself when faced with this challenge that will show us the sort of person he is, a common Hemingway theme, and he does just that.This is a very short novel, more, maybe, a novella or large short story. But it has the feel of a parable. There is definitely something going on here even if it keeps slipping out of my analytical net.I was reminded of another well-known fish story, Moby Dick (really, allow a little literary license here people. Yes I know the whale is not a fish. Geez.). Whereas in that one, the fisherman, Ahab, sets himself against the whale, and therefore either fate or god, seeing a personal enemy, Santiago sees the fish as his brother, a fellow creature in the universe acting out his part. The challenge is always about oneself and not about the external enemy, or rival. In fact, the fish and Santiago are both victimized, together, by the sharks that feast on his catch.Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought. But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is not one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great dignity.One might be forgiven for seeing here a possible reference to catholic communion and the relative merit of so many of those who receive. Is the fish (a Christian symbol if there ever was one) meant to be Jesus or some other form of deity, as Moby was?Could it be that Hemingway's notion of religion is less Christian and more a sort of materialist (as in non-spiritual, not as in accumulating stuff) philosophy? Lacking the proper tackle for that I will leave such considerations to those who have spent more time than I trolling Hemingway's waters.The writing is mostly either third-person description or the old man's internal, and sometimes spoken, dialogue. Regardless of the literary ambitions splashing about here, the story is about a very sympathetic character. Santiago is a man not only of physical strength, but moral character. He is not portrayed as a saint, but as a simple man, maybe even, in a way, an ideal man in his simplicity. He knows his place in the world, faces the challenges that world presents to him and using only his skill, intelligence, strength and determination, overcomes (or not). It is easy to climb on board as a Santiago supporter. He is a fellow who is very much a part of the world, even as he contemplates larger things.The Old Man and the Sea is a small story, but it is a whale of a tale. If you have not fished these waters before, don't let this be one of those that got away.WB32==============================UPDATES1/5/13 - Jeffrey Keeten sent along thisamazing link.

        "user_review": "\"But man is not made for defeat\" he said. \"A man can be destroyed, but not defeated.\"The Old Man and the Sea ~~ Ernest Hemingway\"I first encountered Hemingway in college while taking a humanities class; the professor had us read Hemingway'sThe Nick Adams Stories. I fell in love with Hemingway's short stories. I wrote an impassioned paper on the character of Nick and received an \"A\" for my efforts. Throughout the years, I have returned to Hemingway's short stories, and novellas, and I have never been disappointed.Fast forward 15 years:The Old Man and the Seahad been on my book shelves for quite some time. I picked it up on a whim on July 21st, in honor of Hemingway's birthday. So once again, I returned to the world of Ernest Hemingway.The Old Man and the Seais told with extraordinary simplicity. It is amazing that Hemingway accomplishes so much using so little. Hemingway sacrifices nothing, and shows that brevity is the essence of style here. He clearly draws a portrait of the inner and outer strength of this amazing man. A man who faces each day with a quiet dignity.The Old Man and the Seais not just a tale of a man and a fish. It is a story of man against nature, and valor, in the face of adversity. Most importantly, it is a story of man and God. To quote William Faulkner:\"His best. Time may show it to be the best single piece of any of us, I mean his and my contemporaries. This time, he discovered God, a Creator. Until now, his men and women had made themselves, shaped themselves out of their own clay; their victories and defeats were at the hands of each other, just to prove to themselves or one another how tough they could be. But this time, he wrote about pity: about something somewhere that made them all: the old man who had to catch the fish and then lose it, the fish that had to be caught and then lost, the sharks which had to rob the old man of his fish; made them all and loved them all and pitied them all. It's all right. Praise God that whatever made and loves and pities Hemingway and me kept him from touching it any further.\"Hemingway celebrates the daring and resolve of the old man. Hemingway celebrates this man who goes thru life alone, ferocious, heroic, daring, showing what Hemingway views as the human spirt at its very best. I can't help but think this is how Papa Hemingway views himself.There is another story being told here as well; one of the purest, most beautiful stories of friendship I've ever read. The old man is not alone. He has a friendship, with a young boy who began fishing with him when the boy was only five. Their story is rooted in love, and mutual respect. The boy has been forced to work with another boat, a luckier boat, by his parents. He dreams of working with the old man once more. When the old man goes to war with the fish, he says repeatedly, \"I wish the boy were here.\"I am surprised that there is such animosity towards this brilliant work. Most people are introduced to this work in high school. That is really quite a shame since it is not intended for the young. With their limited life experience, they cannot relate to the old man.Is there a place for Hemingway's view of the world today? Politicians' speak of individualism, and point to rugged individualism. But in this world of Trumps and McConnells, Kardashians and Kanyes, the individual spirit is trampled on daily. Are there any people left in this world like the old man? I don't know of any.To those who criticize this brilliant work, I understand; today we live lives far removed from the old man's world. But Hemingway forces us to remember the spirit of the individual, the struggle for human dignity in the face of our daily struggles to survive. Hemingway forces us to recognize bravery, tenacity, expertise, skill and strength."

Life and Time magazines said so, and they were the gospel truth for our parents...That was the morning my parents had scheduled to get our hardwood flooring refinished, so all us kids had to be outa there pronto!So, little James Deans all, my buddies and I decided grimly to ride our bikes far, far into the rural countryside.Our chests were hollow, as happens at times when you lose someone special.So, we thought, A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do - saddle up and ride out!We rode for hours that day. Me, Ricky, my little brother and Peter Teal. We knew on the way back we'd be bucking the strong north wind, but we didn't care...Finally we arrived at an eerily abandoned farmhouse.Obviously, no one had lived there for years. But everything - furniture, appliances, even cutlery on the table - was strangely untouched. Like the family wasn't planning to go far...Just like Ernest Hemingway. He just had to go and get some Fresh Air, away from all his demons for a moment!A month later I read this book. My Mom the librarian said it was a good place to start with this great writer.With school starting soon and the days getting shorter, I read about Santiago and his dream.And the Great Victory he had won in that dream...The greatest victory of all -The victory of the immortal human Heart over Despair."

This story is emblematic of it, and corroborated the concept phenomenonally , in entirety and handsomely! Indeed, a MASTERPIECE.The appealing themes of unity, undying heroism, and obsession with proving one's worthiness, are propounded gracefully.I forever tried my best to increase the rating beyond3.5-stars, but could not, seriously in a pickle situation! :(Maybe because of the exposition ofhopelessness, declining age and at no juncture of the story, seeing infused-hope, refrained me from falling in \"true-love\" with this \"award-winning story\"!I am a sucker of hope-inducing plots.Though Santiago remains undefeated till the end, still the signals of despondency and down-heartedness at smooth intervals, gave me a grimace of pain!At no point I was unleashed from this vicious cycle of pain and despondency conferred on by old-age and dwindling muscle!Old-age is fated, inevitable and a hard-fact, which cannot be changed, and hence wailing over it and commiserating, didn't do any good to me.Irrespective of the lack, Santiago keeps fighting, which iscreditable.One of my biggest take-aways from my personal life is- harping or sympathizing with irrevocably painful truths, pervades more despondence and imparts infirmity!Again,this is purely my stance, so couldn't go beyond 3.5-stars!##########################What stood out for me?The unique relationship between the old man and boy, comprising of sincere love and friendship! Afterall, they had spent countless hours on the sea together.Love and concern weren't incumbent on the boy, but just out of compassion for the old man! 😊Old age –the limitation of being old is shown clearly in this story. Though the old man keeps cursing his diminishing strength, old and decrepit body,but he remains undefeated, until the very end of his battle with the sea!As stated earlier, irrespective of being unbeaten, I personally was cast down onlooking the shrinking strength and grim circumstances of Santiago!The closing line, mentions about him dreaming of lions. Lions are symbolic of valor, strength and youth.According to me he dreamt of them, hoping to get back his youth or found solace and comfort basking in his memories of youth.This story propounds a lot on aging and diminishing strength!=========================================================NB-I haven't shared any events during the expedition or upon his return. There are existing brimming reviews on GRs openly disclosing spoilers for this story (and many other stories), but yet not marked!The title \"The Old Man and the Sea\" is the biggest spoiler in itself, so fault-finders and overtly sensitive readers, kindly sue Ernst Hemingway 😊 Thanks!"

        "user_review": "The Old Man and the SeabyErnest HemingwayWith a language of great force and simplicity, it tells the story of an old fisherman whom luck seems to have abandoned. And also of the dire challenge he faces. The story is quite simple. I know there were enough tension moments in this book. But still, I didn't enjoy the story much.Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.Good story."

        "user_review": "The wolves will come...I started this in high spirits as my updates show: \"fifth re-read, how thrilling it is to plumb new depths in old wells of wisdom...\"But, as I read on towards the last few pages, I couldn't shake the feeling that this isMoby Dickset in an alternate universe.In this alternate universe:The Giant Leviathanis a noble, unseen fish - steady and without malice.Captain Ahabis transformed into a gentle, wise old zen master. Santiago - a humble fisherman with no legendary crew to command and only his frail body instead of a Pequod to do his bidding.Ishmaelis a young boy, who instead of being a \"end is nigh\" Nostradamus is a loving, weeping young boy who cares deeply about the world.Queequegis probably the dolphin which was the old man's only hope against his foe, his brother.Now Moby Dick for me was the grand struggle of an obsessed genius with his destiny (in fact, about the creative struggle) - it proves that life is a tragedy and in the grand conclusion, you go down with a mighty confrontation and your ambitions take you down to the depths of the sea - no trace left of either you or your grand dreams except a mist of madness propagated as a half-heard story.This was profound and it moved me to tears - but it was still grand, was it not? The great struggle, the titanic battle and the heroic capitulation! It was operatic and it was uplifting - even amidst the tragedy, the mighty bellow of man's cry in the face of the unconquerable; that gave me goosebumps.ButHemingwayand his Old Man has turned the story on its head.It takes you beyond the happily-ever-after of Moby Dick (!) and as always those unchartered waters are beyond description. This alternate universe is much more cruel and much more real. There is no grand confrontation that ends in an inspirational tragedy.It turns it into a battle of attrition - you are inevitably defeated even in success and life will wear you down and leave no trace of your ambitions.It makes you battle to the last breaking point of every nerve and sinew and lets you win a hollow victory that you cannot celebrate as life has worn you out too much in your pursuit of your goals and the destiny, the destiny too now seems more and more unreal and you ask yourself if you were even worthy enough to start the battle.And as you turn back after that jaded victory, then comes the sharks, inevitably, inexorably. And then begins the real battle, not the grand epic, but a doomed, unenthusiastic battle against reality - with the knowledge that no grand ambition can ever succeed.And the old man tells it for you - \"I never should have gone out that far!\"The alternate universe is depressing and it is Zen at the same time, I do not know how. I probably have to read this many more times before any hope, any secret light in it comes to illuminate me - for today, for this reading, Hemingway has depressed me beyond belief and I cannot remember how I always thought of this as an inspirational fable!The scene in which the restaurant lady sees the bones of the once great fish sums it up for me - In the end you give up hope of success and only wish that at the very least you might be able to bring back a ghost of the fish so that people can see how great your target really was - but all they see is the almost vanished skeleton of your idea; your grand dreams are just so much garbage now and who will have the imagination to see the grandeur it had at its conception?\"They beat me, Manolin,\" he said. \"They truly beat me.\"\"He didn't beat you. Not the fish.\"\"No. Truly. It was afterwards.\""

Only bits and pieces of the great Marlin remain. What a book and what a powerful prose. A book to take with you on a deserted island. You seldom find so much symbolism condensed in one single and relatively short book. Very emotional and moving. One of my alltime favourites, a timeless classic! Recommended? I would say this is an absolute must read!"

We were aware of each minute spent in this capital of human storytelling, of the neverending drama of human culture and nature in interaction and in occasional clashes. Looking out over the river, my son and I spot the sorry remains of a boat, just the bare metal frame without any \"flesh\", and we instinctively say at the same time:\"Hemingway's old man!\"We look at each other, smile at our simultaneous association, and start arguing whether or not one can see the fish in the same way as a boat, or whether the destruction of the boat is a more definitive loss. While we are arguing, my younger children are enquiring about the story we discuss, and we give them the details.\"Losing something means you really had it!\"That is their conclusion, and while my eldest son and I start pondering whether or not the younger two are ready for the old man and the sea in Hemingway's own words, we continue walking, and life goes on, and a new generation of Hemingway readers find sense and meaning in his parable on the human struggle.We feel like saying: \"I'm sorry, boat!\", in the same way the old man said: \"I'm sorry, fish!\"But the fact that it lies there showing its naked metal ribs tells us it truly existed. That's more than nothing. And it is not a bad place for a boat to rest. Just like the old man and the fish are in good hands between the covers of a Hemingway novel.Nothing's lost as long as we can tell stories about it.Brilliant parable of man's struggle with nature and himself. Beautifully written. One of my favorite Hemingways.PS: And a Pulitzer that I don't find disappointing."

I couldn't understand what was special about it. It took me ten more years, and a couple more rereads to understand the riveting nature of this book. Many of my friends also had a similar experience. The story of Santiago is something which we can finish reading quickly.

        "user_review": "\"He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff on the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days without a fish.\"A masterpiece.I know that many many young people are still forced to read this book in school and don't quite get what all the hoopla is about, but I think it is not written with young people primarily in mind. There is the boy that supports the old man, true, but as with other stories about old people facing hardship—King Lear comes to mind—I think other stories may connect better for young people. I know I read this as a young man, maybe first at 14, and liked it just fine, then taught it in various settings, and don't think I appreciated it anywhere as much in any previous reading as I do now. Maybe because now I begin to approach the age of the old man!\"Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the color of the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\"When I grew up my Dad and his brother Joe took me out fishing for decades, teaching me each time we went out how to fish. Always teaching me. We fished for decades perch and walleye and pike in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, on Lake Manistique. In a boat with a small motor and oars. Or fishing for Coho Salmon and Lake Trout in a larger boat ten-twelve miles out Lake Michigan. Neither of them spoke much in the boat, nor encouraged me to speak, or do much of anything but focus on the fishing lines before me as if in some religious observance. We'd be out on the lake before dawn and get back at dusk. I loved then as now to read, but this was not allowed, really, in the boat. Full concentration was required. I learned how to respond in such a way that I would keep the fish on the line and not allow him to spit out the hook. I learned the very specific strategies for reeling them in. I learned how the fisherman and the fish were in contest, and this required presence in every moment.\"Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish he had ever seen and the biggest he had ever heard of. . .\"I had not read this book for decades, not since my Dad died, now many years ago, so that was part of my reading this time, connecting it to my Dad and fishing with my Dad and Uncle Joe, in a way. I didn't think much about my own parenting or mentoring, as much, actually, though the book is about that, too.The book conveys in simple language the fight of one man's life, for days alone attempting to reel in the largest fish he has ever encountered, who drags him on the line farther and farther out to sea. If you like to fish, this is also a fine book. It's a Biggest Fish Ever story. And if you like nature, you learn about the importance of the sea and various birds and fish. It's the outdoors, where Hem always preferred to be, a place of purity.\"Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish. As wonderful as he is.\"In the process Hemingway manages to convey several dimensions of his code for living: Courage, humility, endurance, respect for others. And then, it's not about the fish, it's about what it means to be fully human, to the very end. Right, it can be read as allegory.So, in this match with. . . death, he's resourceful: \"No, no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what you have.\"\"I will show him what a man can do and what a man can endure.\"\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\"Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for this book, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, the nearest west suburb of Chicago. He died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds in Idaho in 1961. I thought of that fact while reading this book, about whether Papa had finally been defeated, out of emotional resources himself at the very end. But as he aged, he wrote one hell of a book about \"the human condition,\" about aging, about the importance of surviving whatever challenges we may face today, about hope and striving, as inspiration for the rest of us."

He could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that. He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of the pulling.If the caught fish, however big, is man's greatest achievement then his life is frittered away…"

Bătrînul Santiago nu vrea să se răzbune pe nimeni: el se luptă să aducă un pește uriaș la țărm și este înfrînt de cruzimea indiferentă a naturii. Doar atît. Povestirea e în mare parte monologul lui Santiago:\"Nu-s vreun credincios, zise el. Dar ca să prind peştele ăsta, o să zic de zece ori «Tatăl nostru» şi de zece ori «Bucură-te, Marie» şi mă leg că dacă o să-l prind, o să merg în pelerinaj la Sfînta Fecioară din Cobre. Făgăduiesc s-o fac\".\"E aşa de simplu atunci cînd eşti înfrînt. Nu mi-am dat seama niciodată cît de simplu e. Şi cine te-a înfrnt? - se întrebă apoi. Nimeni, îşi răspunse singur...\".După ce a tipărit, în 1952, povestireaThe Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway a fost scandalizat de îndrăzneala comentariilor (mitologice, simbolice, arhetipale etc.). Uimit - şi pe bună dreptate! - de natura strident metafizică a multor recenzii, autorul a exclamat într-un interviu: \"Aici [înBătrînul şi marea- n.m.] nu există nici un simbolism. Marea e mare, bătrînul e bătrîn, copilul e copil şi peştele e peşte. Întreg simbolismul presupus de cititori e vorbă goală şi nerozie:All the symbolism that people say is shit\". Să mai spun că avertismentul prozatorului nu a fost respectat? Spun.P. S.Nu mi-au plăcut, totuși, frecventele declarații cu privire la măreția și noblețea omului. Mi-au adus aminte de lozincile existențialiste din anii '40-'50 ai secolului trecut:\"Nu există niciun fel de traducere pentru acest cuvînt şi poate că nici nu-i de fapt decît sunetul pe care l-ar scoate involuntar un om cînd ar simţi cum pironul i se înfige în mîini şi pătrunde în lemn\" (probabil o aluzie la Iisus). Și încă una: \"Dar omul nu e făcut să fie înfrînt, declamă el. Un om poate fi distrus, dar nu înfrînt\".Foarte frumos! Dar asta rezultă din povestirea lui Santiago, nu mai e nevoie s-o proclami..."

        "user_review": "The Old Man and The Sea is a short story by Ernest Hemingway which talks about an old lonely fisherman who was being shunned as he was considered bad luck when it comes to fishing and those who live around. Except for a young boy who takes care that he sleeps, eats and carry on with his normal daily routine, the old man lives a rather lonely life who takes pleasure in talking about baseball and his old fishing adventures.The plot revolves around two days and nights when he sets out to get hold of a big fish being unable to haul it alone and getting carried by the fish until he reaches the shore.I enjoyed reading about this character who's symbolic of resilience, loneliness, adventurous spirit and the writing is thoroughly engaging till the end.I feel how the book ends leaves m the readers as how to interpret the story in their own terms, mine being the main character showed what he could do inspite of all the challenges and the constant criticism he was facing.This is my second read from the author, the first being A Farewell To Arms which I read years ago and loved it inspite of the unlikeable main character. Looking forward to read more of the author's work.The author's life story is pretty interesting as well. Love how this book's introduction gave a short information on the author."

        "user_review": "Ernest Hemingway is considered one of the masters of American 20th century fiction. Garnering from his life experiences, his novels reflect on his time as a newspaper reporter and correspondent in a Europe during both the inner war and war years. A member of the lost generation, Hemingway was the first of his group to have a major work published. In addition to all of the accolades bestowed upon him, Hemingway is considered along Steinbeck to be a master storyteller, especially of short stories. The crowning achievement to an illustrious career, The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1952, less than ten years before Hemingway's death.Santiago is an older fisherman in Havana. He is content fishing and contemplating on his life while finding out the daily baseball scores. His favorite ball player is Joe DiMaggio because his father was a famed fisherman. As a younger man, Santiago was considered the strongest man in Havana, one time outlasting a negro from Cienfuegos in a twenty four hour arm wrestling duel. Yet, despite his fame and accomplishments as a fisherman, Santiago's luck has run out on hm. As an older man, her needs help from a boy to complete his daily fishing hauls and tasks, and has not caught a fish in 84 days. In spite of this run of poor luck, Santiago still returns to the seas on a daily basis, hopeful to catch the big fish that has alluded him for his entire life.Because of lack of successes, his boy has turned to another, lucky fishing boat. Santiago has to go at it alone, with only two fishing lines and baits. Determined to catch that big one, he sets out even with the dangers of sea, especially sharks, knowing that each journey into the water could be his last. Yet, this is subsistence and sustenance for many people on an island, so Santiago persists at his task. His voyage for the big fish becomes more than a fishing trip but his contemplating life, bestowing his wisdom on both the fishing trade and life knowledge on the younger generations. This is without the assurance that he will even catch a fish or if this determination to catch the big one will be his last voyage.From this 120 page novella, one can see glimpses of Hemingway's greatness. His sentences are full of imagery and imparting the wisdom of a rich life. As an older man, he himself enjoyed fishing and Santiago mirrors how Hemingway spent his later life. I have read a number of Pulitzers, and while the writing of this novella is enriching, I am left wondering if perhaps Hemingway won the award here as a crowning jewel on his life body of work. The story was captivating and full of messages yet a novella, rather than a novel. Perhaps, unbeknownst to me, this powerful novella was the best work of fiction in its given year and worthy of the award.In my quest to read the Pulitzers, I am glad that I was finally lead to read Hemingway. It is clear to me that he is a master of his craft, and I look forward to reading his further work. The Old Man and the Sea looks back on an enriching life and won Hemingway a deserving award, if not for his lifetime of writing. As a lovely story and another Pulitzer I can check off my list, The Old Man and the Sea rates 4 powerful stars."

        "user_review": "Someone recently asked me what review I enjoyed writing the most, and, well, this is it:I have a massive problem with this book. It's one I'm a little embarrassed to admit. The problem is not with the writing or the characters that Stevenson has created; it's not even with the plot. The problem resides with Kermit the Frog. (Stay with me here!) I grew up watching the muppets. I became slightly obsessed with them. I kind of wanted to join them. So, whenever I read about Captain Smollett and Long John Silver all I can see is Kermit fighting Tim Curry!Therefore, I just can't take this book seriously. Well, at least not completely. The Muppet Treasure Island is such a great film; it's hilarious. This book was much more serious. The pirates in here aren't singing toys; they're hardened criminals that created the pirate stereotype. They're the sort of men you don't want on your ship because they'd likely cut your throat in your sleep. They might wake you up first if they're feeling kind. So, they wouldn't try and gain your trust by singing you a jolly song about piracy, like Tim and his muppet mates would.But, muppet based comparison aside, this is a good novel. I did quite enjoy it. It all begins when the young Jim Hawkins comes across a map for buried treasure, except he hasn't got any money to fund the voyage. HeGonzo and Rizzogoes alone and seeks the help ofFozzie BearSquire Trelawney. As a member of the Victorian gentry, he takes the map for himself with the intention of filling his own coffers with the loot. He's not a very nicebearguy, and he's not overly intelligent either. In his frugality he accidently hires a group of twistedmuppetspirates that, unsurprisingly, mutiny against him.This all sounds terrible, I know. But, it's not all bad because the ship's captain is none other thanKermit the FrogCaptain Smollett who is absolutely in love withMiss Piggyno one. Indeed, Smollett is in direct contrast to the money drivenFozzieTrelawney because he is everything he is not; he is brave and honourable; he is completely true to his word. He is competing, unknowingly, for the attention of Jim. The young boy is looking for a farther figure, and in Silver and Smollett he sees two potential role models, and two potential life choices.It all works out in the end though because this is amuppet movieadventure book after all. In all seriousness, it is an exciting book. But, for me, that's all it is. There are no hidden motives or dark secrets. Everything is straight forward, clean cut and simple. It is a nice easy read. Stevenson's masterpiece is most definitelyThe Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde.That's where the real mystery is at. But, it doesn't have muppets…..Facebook|Twitter|Insta|Academia"

You have the Admiral Benbow, a little boy named Jim Hawkins, \"Captain\" Billy Bones, a cruffy old pirate, an incredible eerie pre-story (black spot), a treasure hunt, the ghost of Flint (Ben Gunn), the fight with Israel Hands and of course the one-legged villain Long John Silver. So many fine characters and an absolutely compelling plot. I've watched all the movies and series about Treasure Island as a kid and still like that classic at my age. What more can I say? Must read. This is one of the most famous adventure books you'll ever come across."

        "user_review": "THE Pirate Adventure by Excellence.18th century, Bristol Channel. Jim Hawkins is the young son of the innkeeper of the Admiral Benbow Inn. One day an old suspiciously wary sailor makes his entrance and lodges for a time. After his untimely death due to a stroke, revising his belongings, Jim finds a map revealing what could be the possible location of a treasure hidden by the infamous pirate Captain Flint and his gang. With the help of Dr. Livesey, John Trelawney, Captain Smollett and cook Long John Silver, they arm the schooner Hispaniola with enough crew members and resources to make an expedition to the island in search of the treasure.This one is by all accounts the most famous pirate story ever written, spawning countless of adaptations and retellings in books, films, plays, and whatnot.It's been ages since I read it, and at the time for me this was just another classic book like any other. I remember enjoying it enough, the plot everything you can expect from a pirate story, the characters not great but very memorable, like the iconic one-legged eye-patched pirate with the parrot on the shoulder. So classic! The pacing somewhat slow but not enough to be bothersome. Decently easy to read, considering, although that may be because I read it in spanish. I wouldn't mind rereading it someday to admire it in its full splendor a second time around, savouring now everything with full knowledge of its literary importance, and in its original language.A true immortal classic like few others. 3.5 rounded up for legendary status. A must read, if only to know the original work that inspired so many others after. Recommendable.It's public domain. You can find itHERE.Still remaining, the movie (1950) and (1990)-----------------------------------------------PERSONAL NOTE:[1882] [311p] [Classics] [3.5] [Conditional Recommendable] [\"X never, ever marks the spot.\"]-----------------------------------------------LA Aventura de Piratas por Excelencia.Siglo XVIII, Canal de Bristol. Jim Hawkins es el joven hijo del dueño de la Posada Almirante Benbow. Un día un viejo y sospechoso marinero hace su entrada y se hospeda por un tiempo.

Con la ayuda del Dr. Livesey, John Trelawney, Capitán Smollett y el cocinero Long John Silver, arman la goleta Hispaniola con suficientes tripulantes y recursos para hacer una expedición a la isla en búsqueda del tesoro.Esta es a todas cuentas la más famosa historia de piratas jamás escrita, generando un sinfín de adaptaciones y recreaciones en libros, filmes, teatro y que no.Hace demasiado que leí esto, y en su tiempo para mí sólo fue otro libro clásico como cualquier otro. Recuerdo disfrutarlo lo suficiente, la trama todo lo que uno puede esperar de una historia de piratas, los personajes no geniales pero sí muy memorables, como el icónico pirata cojo con parche de ojo y loro en el hombro. ¡Tan clásico! El ritmo algo lento pero no lo suficiente para ser molesto. Decentemente fácil de leer, considerando, aunque tal vez eso se deba a que lo leí en español. No me molestaría releerlo algún día para admirarlo en todo su esplendor una segunda vez, saboreando ahora todo con pleno conocimiento de su importancia literaria, y en su lenguaje original.Un verdadero clásico inmortal como pocos otros. 3.5 redondeado para arriba por status legendario.

        "user_review": "3 items worthy of note in Robert Louis Stevenson's classic treasure \"Treasure Island\":1) There are a ton of tropes! We understand that this is pretty much what Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ripped off, making tons of money off of this adventurous classic, including but not limited to: rampant alcoholism; a code of honor; castaways (at sea or in land); shipwrecks (new and ancient); treason (group & individual) & double crosses; mutiny, hostages, captures and shocking escapes; strangers appearing from the mist & pirate flags; raresome slapstick comedy (\"...[he] fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor.\" [16]) & good comedic timing (the parrot tells everybody The Secret, ruining plans); a compass made up entirely of human bones; & ghosts.2)Jim Hawkins is your typical YA protagonist prototype. He's the go-between the two fighting groups, the one who bargains with the villain Long John Silver (mmm.... breaded fish and shrimp...yumm) and propels the narrative forward. He's the center; a dreamer; while he loses his humility he attains a coming-of-age wisdom that peaks at the point where he brandishes a pistol for the first time.3)The plot resembles a Hollywood blockbuster. There is very little inaction, but when it occurs (such as the villain's cliched soliloquy or the factions grunting against their enemies) it does decelerate the pace of the story. Here is a very substantial urge to make everything explosive & loud. Thank you, Mr. Stevenson!"

Before, there were a few classic pearls by authors that weren´t just able to write good stories, but understood the most important ingredient of compelling artMixing character and plotFrom the beginning, there are more and more unfolding open questions, mysteries, Chekhovs, and MacGuffins that are always fused with character motivation. This today totally normal thing was outstanding in the old days and is a reason why many classics are average, boring, or just simply bad. Take the terrible other island classics like Robinson Crusoehttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...or Lord of the Flieshttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7...They both don´t just suck at being mind blowing, but have stupid messages and ideologies integrated the authors want to get into the readers' brains. In contrast,Stephenson understood that there should be just a high and good entertainment levelHe creates a complex crew of characters, always throws them in a small territory they can´t escape from, ships, forts, a treasure hunt, and slowly escalates the whole thing. Because I´m a fan of epigenetics and the sociocultural evolution of fictional concepts, I could already search, find, and see the progress of a once spread trope idea inSo many other works inspired by itBe it horror, fantasy, or my favorite genre to rule them all, sci fi, they all developed new ideas about how to find the magic stone, the skull of the necromantic god emperor, or the alien artifact. And what leaves me stunned in even more awe is that, in the other time direction, a few thousand years ago the first ancient storytellers were inspired by the totally forgotten tales of primitive starving stone age artists. Who probably invented the idea of a hero's journey to find the fattest and most delicious mammoth.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "Arr, me matey!I've finally downed the children's classic, Treasure Island.Sadly, these pirates weren't nearly as sexy as I was expecting. Where were all the sweaty pirate abs I've come to expect from the plethora of trashy romance novels I've gobbled down over the years?Not here, that's for damn sure.And mainly because of the overabundance of bodice rippers on my bookshelf, I felt like Imaybeneeded to expand my maritime horizons, and it seemed that going with a classic sailor story wouldn't be a bad way to accomplish that goal.Unsurprisingly, this is a pretty boring book by today's standards. And if this was what they gave kids to read back in the day, I'm no longer shocked that people found long walks and/or journaling about said long walks a valid form of entertainment.When I'm done churning this butter, should I whittle for a bit before we have a family sing-a-long around the fire?Going to be totally honest, I don't understand the yearning for a simpler lifestyle, as this scenario sounds like my own personal version of Hell.Alright!Treasure Islandby Robert Louis Stevensonand why you should read it.It's short!<--not as much of a time suck asCount of Monte CristoIt's a classic!<-- therefore, you will soundclassyIt's got pirates!<--remember: dirty rum-bloated pirates, not shirtless Fabio piratesYou can learn new drinking songs!<--Yo ho ho and a bottle of Zima, bitchesThat all sounds great.But what is Treasure Island about, Anne?The gist is that our young hero, Jim Hawkins, has the shittiest luck ever.His dad dies and leaves a tweenage Jim and his mother with a ramshackle inn to run, complete with a scary drunken sailor (Billy Bones) who's not too keen on paying his tab as a tenant.He's what the kids these days call a scallywag.Why does it matter that Bones is continually dodging rent?Well, after Billy Bob meets his maker with the help of a few of his old sailing pals, Jim and his mother have to rifle through his things to get payment.AND JIM FINDS A MAP.<--to a place called Treasure Island*choir vocalizes*Back in the day, if you found a map it was apparentlyadventure time.You and your neighbors would rent a ship, hire a sketchy crew, and set out for parts unknown full of high hopes that you'd be coming back with gold doubloons! The reality is that you'd be lucky to come back alive without scurvy or syphilis.And dark thoughts like that are why I would have made a terrible pirate-adventurer...The adults (of course) make some really bad decisions when it comes to securing an efficient crew. They have a competent captain, but instead of listening to him, they hire a fairly obvious villain as the cook and then proceed to take his advice over the captain's. This ensures they have quite a surly group of sailors to man the SS Mutiny.Who is this cook?Long John Silver.<--yes, exactly like the sub-par seafood restaurant!When your cook's name is synonymous with chewy shrimp poppers and diarrhea, you might want to rethink your hiring process.Luckily for all the grown-ups, Jim is a brave and hearty lad who manages to save the day! <--not reallyOk, so this was written back when it was a big deal to keep your word. Like, if you promised your kidnappers that you wouldn't try to run for it, then youcouldn't try to run for itbecause that would make you a liar. Which, for some unfathomable reason, was worth more than your life.SWEAR TO GOD, THESE OLD-TIMEY PEOPLE WERE RIDICULOUS.Naturally, there comes a point in the story where Jim needed to hop a fence and get the hell out of there, but wouldn't - because INTEGRITY. And I suppose we're meant to think he's a better person for it, but all I could think was that maybe Stevenson based his story around a child with special needs.Except, no. Because the doctor agreed with Jim, so apparently in the days of yore, the good guys couldn't justwin, they had to win by a set of idiotic rules.Which is nuts! What are you teaching our kids, Robert!?Looking someone dead in the eyes whilst giving a firm handshake and lying through your teeth is a fuckinglifeskillthat every child needs to have perfected by adulthood in order to survive.But whatever. This is a fantasy, so it all works out for our heroes.They return home with their honor intact, a good bit of wealth, no STDs, and only a little bit of PTSD that kicks in whenever they hear a parrot squawk.Read it. As far as classics go, you could do a lot worse than this one.Michael Prichard - Narrator"

        "user_review": "Treasure Island, Robert Louis StevensonTreasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, narrating a tale of\"buccaneers and buried gold\".Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an \"X\", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.An old sailor named Billy Bones comes to lodge in the rural Admiral Benbow Inn on the West English coast. He tells the innkeeper's son, Jim Hawkins, to keep a lookout for\"a one-legged seafaring man.\"A former shipmate, Black Dog, confronts Bones and engages in a violent fight with him. After Black Dog is run off, a blind beggar named Pew visits to give Bones\"the black spot\"as a summons to share a map leading to buried treasure. Shortly thereafter, Bones suffers a stroke and dies.Pew and his accomplices attack the inn, but Jim and his mother save themselves while taking Bones's sea chest. Inside the chest, they find a map of an island on which the infamous pirate Captain Flint hid his treasure.Jim shows the map to the local physician Dr. Livesey and the district squire John Trelawney, and they decide to make an expedition to the island, with Jim serving as a cabin boy. They set sail on Trelawney's schooner, the Hispaniola, under Captain Smollett.Much of the crew, as it is later revealed, are pirates who served under Captain Flint, most notable of which is the ship's one-legged chef \"Long John\" Silver. Jim, sitting in an apple casket, overhears the conspirators' plan to mutiny after the salvage of the treasure and to assassinate the skippers. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: یکی از روزهای سال 1973میلادیعنوان: جزیره گنج؛ نویسنده: رابرت لوئیس (لوئیز) استیونسون (استیونسن)؛ مترجم: هاجر تربیت؛ تهران، بنگاه ترجمه، چاپ دوم 1343، در 278ص؛مترجم: اردشیر نیکپور؛ تهران، گوتنبرگ، چاپ دوم 1351، در 364ص؛ موضوع: داستان کودکان از نویسندگان اسکاتلند - سده 19ممترجمهای دیگر، خانمها و آقایان: «حسین دستوم»؛ «یوسف فرخ»؛ «عباس کرمی فر»؛ «پرویز نجم الدینی»؛ «محسن سلیمانی»؛ «امیرمهدی مراد حاصل»؛ «صفورا کلهر»؛ «احمد کسایی پور»؛ «سپهر شهلایی»؛ «علی اکبری»؛ «علیرضا نعمتی»؛ «محمدرضا جعفری»؛ «نعیمه ظاهری»؛ «آرمین هدایتی»؛ «مهسا طاهریان»؛ «مهسا یزدانی»؛ «محمد قصاع»؛ «امین دادور»؛ «سهیل رمضانی»؛ «محمد همت خواه»؛ «ناهید حاجی سلیمانی»؛ «شهلا طهماسبی»؛ «بیتا ابراهیمی»؛ «سوده کریمی»؛ و ...؛داستانی ماجراجویانه، که «رابرت لویی (لوئیز یا لوئیس) استیونسُن» نویسنده «اسکاتلندی» نوشته است؛ این رمان نخستین بار در سال 1883میلادی به صورت کتاب به چاپ رسید، و موضوع آن درباره ی دزدان دریایی، و گنجی مدفون، در یک جزیره است؛ «جزیره ی گنج» هماره در زمره ی ادبیات کودک و نوجوان، بوده است، و منتقدان آن را به خاطر توصیف استادانه ی نویسنده، از: «شخصیت‌ها»، «رویدادها»، و «فضای داستان»، بسیار ستوده‌ اند؛ بارها به روی صحنه ی تئاترها، و پرده ی سینماها رفته، و از محبوبیت ویژه ای، نزد نوجوانان، برخوردار استرابرت لویی استیونسن، تنها فرزند «توماس استیونسن» یکی ازبهترین مهندسان شهر بود؛ او که از کودکی ضعیف و مریض احوال بود، پس از سفر به کشورهای گوناگون، سالهای پایانی زندگی را، در سرزمین دلخواهش «سامو» گذراند؛ مردمان بومی، ایشان را «قصه گوی قصه ها» نامیدند؛ دریانوردی پیر، در مسافرخانه‌ ای میمیرد، و «جیم» در صندوقچه‌ ی او، نقشه ی گنجی را مییابد؛ او و دوستانش، به جزیره‌ ای دور سفر میکنند، اما دزدان دریایی خطرناکی نیز به دنبال همان گنج هستندنقل از آغاز متن: (مسافرخانه ی «آدمیرال بِن بو»: از من خواسته اند که هرچه درباره ی جزیره ی گنج میدانم، از اول تا آخر بنویسم؛ برای همین هم چیزی را از قلم نمیاندازم؛ ماجرای من، موقعی شروع شد که پدرم هنوز مسافرخانه ی «آدمیرال بِن بو» را اداره میکرد و این همان موقعی بود که دریانوردی پیر، برای اولین بار به مسافرخانه ی ما آمد؛ خوب به یاد دارم، انگار همین دیروز بود؛ او جلوی در مسافرخانه آمد؛ پشت سرش، یک گاری دستی بود که روی آن صندوقچه ای قرار داشت؛ مرد تازه وارد، قوی و بدقواره بود و کت ملوانی آبی رنگ و کثیفی به تن داشت؛ روی دستانش علامت زخمی دیده میشد و ناخنهایش سیاه و شکسته بود؛ روی صورتش هم علامت زخم شمشیر بوداو به خلیج کوچک جلوی مسافرخانه نگاه میکرد و برای خودش سوت میزد؛ پس از مدتی، ناگهان شروع به خواندن یکی از آوازهای قدیمی ملوانها کرد: پانزده مرد، روی سینه ی یک مرده؛ یوهوهو، هوهوهودریانورد پیر، پس از اینکه از پدرم یک نوشیدنی گرفت، گفت: «جای جالبی است؛ آدمهای زیادی اینجا می آیند؟»؛پدرم گفت: «نه متاسفانه.»؛مرد گفت: «پس جای من این جاست.»؛ بعد، خدمتکاری را که گاری دستی را آورده بود، صدا زد و گفت: «صندوق را بیاور تو!» و به پدرم گفت: «من آدمی ساده ام؛ از شما هم فقط نوشیدنی، ژامبون و تخم مرغ میخواهم.»؛بعد چند سکه ی طلا روی میز انداخت و گفت: «هر وقت تمام شد، بگویید! در ضمن میتوانید مرا ناخدا صدا بزنید.»؛ناخدا مرد ساکتی بود.؛ تمام روز را با دوربین برنجی اش، در اطراف خلیج یا روی صخره ها پرسه میزد؛ شبها نیز در گوشه ای از سالن مینشست و مینوشید؛ او، اغلب از ما میپرسید: «در جاده، دریانوردی ندیدید؟»؛اوایل فکر میکردیم که او دوست دارد با دریانوردها هم صحبت شود؛ اما وقتی دریانوردی سر راهش به بریستِل به مسافرخانه ی ما میآمد، ناخدا قبل از ورود به سالن پذیرایی، ابتدا از پشت پرده های در، با دقت به او نگاه میکرد و آنگاه وارد میشد و مثل همیشه، ساکت در گوشه ای مینشست.؛روزی، ناخدا مرا به کناری کشید و گفت: «جیم! اگر همیشه مواظب باشی و هر وقت ملوانی یک پا دیدی، فوری به من بگویی، هر ماه یک سکه ی نقره ی چهار پنی به تو میدهم.»؛آن روز، فکر یافتن دریانورد یک پا، خوابهای مرا آشفته کرد؛ با اینحال، بیش از آن که از دریانورد یک پا بترسم، از خود ناخدا میترسیدم، زیرا بعضی از شبها که سرش گرم میشد، همه را ساکت و مجبور میکرد که به داستانهای ترسناکش گوش کنند و آوازهای قدیمی ملوانها را با او بخوانند.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 27/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 05/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

Sicuramente con testo non integrale e adattato all'età.Mi piaceva, m'è piaciuto da subito: il protagonista ragazzino, Jim, nome semplice, senza fronzoli, la sua storia, le sue paure, il suo coraggio, le sue avventure (la sua formazione); il pirata con la gamba di legno, che è cattivo e mette paura, ma poi rivela d'aver cuore e protegge il ragazzo (anche se per interesse); la nave, il mare, l'oceano, l'isola deserta; la mappa, il tesoro, la caverna; il fortino, l'assalto, il rischio della vita, la suspense, e anche qui si stava in ansia e arrivavano i brividi.Sotto il Bay Bridge che collega San Francisco a Oakland c'è Treasure Island, collegata a Yerba Buena.Brividi, paura, mistero e attesa che la serie della RAI diretta dal mitico Anton Giulio Majano, pur nella ristrettezza dei mezzi e delle scenografie (praticamente tutta in studio: ma quale bambino ci faceva caso?), e il coro dei marinai dalla voce roca, quindici uomini sulla cassa del morto (e l'accento sembrava cadere sulla seconda 'o') e una bottiglia di rum, intensificavano.Certo, non al livello di Belfagor, che infatti andava in onda di sera dopo Carosello, mentre L'isola del tesoro era programma pomeridiano. Ma insomma…Sono stati una decina di film tra grande e piccolo schermo, ma lui, Orson, rimane il migliore Long John Silver.Già l'incipit è saporito, e ghiotto:Essendo stato incaricato dal conte Trelawney, dal dottor Livesey e dal resto della compagnia di mettere per iscritto tutti i particolari riguardanti la vicenda dell'Isola del Tesoro, dal principio alla fine, tacendo null'altro che la posizione dell'isola, e questo solo perché non è stato disotterrato tutto il tesoro, prendo la penna nell'anno di grazia 17.. e torno al tempo in cui mio padre gestiva la locanda Ammiraglio Benbow, e il vecchio marinaio col viso bruciato dal sole e sfregiato da un taglio di sciabola prese alloggio sotto il nostro tetto.E anche da adulto si gode la cornice che racchiude tutta la storia, il gusto classico, peraltro dichiarato sin dalla dedica a Lloyd Osbournegentiluomo americano. Questo racconto è stato ideato in armonia con il suo gusto classico, ed oggi è dedicato a lui, in cambio delle numerose ore piacevoli e con gli auguri più cari, dal suo affezionato amico, l'autore.Il piccolo Jim se la vede brutta, i pirati non scherzano.E si apprezza lo sguardo ad altezza d'occhi del protagonista ragazzino, che però non impedisce a Stevenson di approfondire i personaggi e le loro psicologie.E si apprezza il linguaggio di ciascuno di loro che è conforme al loro status sociale: e quindi Jim non parla certo come il conte, ma neppure Long John parla come il capitano.E si apprezza l'intreccio, l'avventura, i colpi di scena, che come ogni buona pubblicità raccomanda, vanno bene per grandi e piccini."

Nevertheless, my daughter appreciated it, probably it's a novel that best suits the tastes of children and young people. In fact, Stevenson has never hidden that the inspiration to the novel came frome his adopted son, Lloyd, with whom in a rainy afternoon drew an island for fun, fantasizing with him on the places about the places map and on future characters. The novel that was taking shape for the 12-year-olds boy's amusement changed in a really fun adventure. Well, then let's all sing it together:«Fifteen men on a dead man's chestYo ho ho and a bottle of rum!»Vote: 7,5«Sollecitato dal conte Trelawney, dal dottor Livesey e dal resto della brigata di scrivere la storia della nostra avventura all'Isola del Tesoro, con tutti i suoi particolari, nessun escluso, salvo la posizione dell'isola. e ciò perché una parte del tesoro ci è ancora nascosta, io prendo la penna nell'anno di grazia 17… e mi rifaccio al tempo in cui mio padre teneva la locanda dell' \"Ammiraglio Benbow\" e il vecchio uomo di mare dal viso sfregiato da un colpo di sciabola prese per la prima volta alloggio presso di noi»L'incipit è di quelli perfetti per un romanzo d'avventura, in grado di introdurre in poche righe tutta la vicenda e contemporaneamente generare nel lettore quella stuzzicante curiosità che invoglia a divorare le pagine. Per la serie \"mettetevi a sedere che ora ne vedrete delle belle\".Confesso però che per me il romanzo diRobert Louis Stevenson, riletto a distanza di anni (lettura serale per mia figlia), ha perso un pò del suo fascino. Mia figlia ha comunque apprezzato, probabilmente è un romanzo che meglio si adatta ai gusti di bambini e ragazzi. D'altronde Stevenson non ha mai nascosto che l'ispirazione per il romanzo gliela ha data il figlio adottivo Lloyd, con il quale in un pomeriggio di pioggia disegnò per gioco un'isola, fantasticando assieme a lui sui luoghi della mappa e sui futuri personaggi. Il racconto che prendeva forma per il divertimento di un ragazzo dodicenne si è poi trasformato in una gran bella avventura. E allora cantiamo tutti insieme:«Quindici uomini sulla cassa del morto,yo-ho-ho, e una bottiglia di rum!»Voto: 7,5"

        "user_review": "YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM!!!This is the iconic novel about pirates that it stands as the best example in this topic and easily one of the most adapted to other media novels in any genre.I can remember having watched several adaptations, live action films, animated movies, even an animated film using animals as the characters, there is the Muppets' one, a Japanese anime TV series, an European mini-series taking the story to outer space starring Anthony Quinn, the animated remake of that version by Disney and the current Starz channel prequel TV series \"Black Sails\". Just to mention the ones that I have watched but there are a lot of more adaptations.While the topic of pirates is a popular one, I think that there aren't much novels about it. At least not examples really worthy of reading them. Obviously there are some here and there, but taking in account how much options one has in other topics in literature, pirates has been a concept seldom touched with success.However, this novel was able to keep on the mind of everybody the storytelling appeal of the topic of pirates inspiring successes on other media such as Japanese anime \"Captain Harlock\" and live actions films of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\".For all that and its own merit,Treasure Islandkeeps retaining the crown as the best novel about pirates.Characters like Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Ben Gunn, Captain Smollett and of course, Long John Silver have become iconic in the universe of literature. Even they have been so admired that other authors couldn't resist to makes homages/mentions of them on their own novels, such examples like onPeter Pan.Its appealing is obvious depending the readers, many young ones can't resist to be amazed by Jim Hawkins who is 14 years old but he is able to keep up in the middle of adult characters and even being a key character in the success of the adventure.To readers and writers of all ages, certainly the character of Long John Silver stands out as one of the best developed characters in the history of literature becoming a model to many following similar ones. He is able to do ruthless things but he has a code, he has limits, and not matter that he is not a nice person, there are things that he never will do and for that, he is a complicated and truly interesting character to read about.Not matter how was on real life, Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, was able to show a romantic picture of pirates' world with now iconic elements like islands with treasures, maps with \"x\"'s, fearful papers with a black spot, peglegs, eye patches, parrots on shoulders, but above all, he had no doubt to show how dangerous and murderous can be real pirates."

Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to – well, yes, I will! – to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands – magistrates and sich – and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow – all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim – him above all.\"It's awesome! The great adventure lies ahead… Goose bumps are guaranteed…Now I see a lot of irony in the tale and even a bit of mockery – a funny quirk with cheese belongs rather to a subtle ridicule than to the romantic treasure hunting…At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart.\"He was a seaman,\" said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. \"Leastways, this is good sea-cloth.\"\"Aye, aye,\" said Silver; \"like enough; you wouldn't look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? 'Tain't in natur'.\"Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight—his feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a diver's, pointing directly in the opposite.\"I've taken a notion into my old numbskull,\" observed Silver. \"Here's the compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island, stickin' out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them bones.\"At different ages we believe in different treasures and they keep luring us."

        "user_review": "Treasure Island is arguably one of the most influential tales in the world of fiction. Every pirate stereotype that we take for granted these days we can see the foundation somewhere in this magic tale. Approaching this story; I am quite lucky that I knew nothing about the plot except that there was a map where X marked the spot showcasing Captain Flint's legendary treasure. I went into the task of reading this like a happy youth, wide-eyed looking forward to experiencing a legendary story for the first time without being hindered with prior knowledge of the narrative, the characters, the pace and the plot twists.So the story goes something like this. An alcoholic ex-pirate Captain spends his days in a local bar drinking himself to death whilst singing jolly pirate songs. \"Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum\" etc... He, unfortunately, passes away and leaves a chest which contains a secret map amongst other treasures. The map is highly sought after by all the wrong people. Our 1st person perspective young superstar Jim Hawkin's finds the map and speaks to his friends Dr. Livesey and a squire, Mr. Trelawney and they decide to venture to this mystical treasure island to hunt for said treasure.Leaving from Bristol, they gather a ships worth of pirates and hands. Experienced in their own ways but none more so than pleasant, pub-owning ship's cook Long John Silver. So off they go on this adventure. They get the treasure and go home and live happily ever after. But, that obviously didn't happen because that would not make a legendary story.The main protagonist, Jim is a great character. This is typically seen as a children's book (although some of the sea and pirate terminology is quite specific and complex) and having the first person perspective shown from the view of a young kid adds to the remarkableness of the story. The fact Jim is a young man who performs extraordinary deeds, often going against the odds on the Hispaniola (the trusty vessel that takes them to treasure island) or the island itself amongst hardened sea-faring men means we really have his back and support his deeds throughout the tale. We feel close to him because of how well Stevenson writes this character. Every time the plot progresses, it is because of an amazing deed that Jim has done, often on his own back without the consultation of the most senior members of the group. We route for him every second of the way because he is us.Things don't work out smoothly when they get to the Island. A divide occurs. Mutiny some might say. A split is presented so Jim, Dr, Squire and a few trusted men are on one side. Old pirates who were part of Captain Flint's crew rally under who we thought was a nice dude. Long John Silver.He is the most complex character in this short book. Peg legged, parrot on his shoulder \"pieces of eight\" are some of his characterisations that you will probably see some 12-year-old child imitating this Halloween. You never quite know where you stand with Silver. He starts off seeming good. Jim overhears his plot of mutiny whilst hiding in a barrel. At that point, he is portrayed as purely evil but towards the end, he seems more human and complex. Sticking up for Jim Hawkins when the rest of his sea mates want to kill the poor lad.Other notable characters are Ben Gunn, the Robinson Crusoe-esque marooned island dweller and Dr. Livesey. It is ingeniously written that in such a short book we can care about so many of the players and their complexity is unrivaled.There are lots of cool scenes. Shootouts on the Island between the two factions. Jim vs. Israel Hands. Meeting Ben Gunn and when Jim goes back to the safe haven of the wooden castle expecting to regroup with his friends but alas... it is not to be.I will end this review with a few pirate clichés that frequent Treasure Island. \"Shiver my timbers\" \"Shipshape\" \"Jolly Roger\" & \"Pieces of Eight\" come to mind.I really enjoyed this. So different to Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde that I have previously read by Stevenson. Yet, that makes a good author, being able to flaunt his linguistic skills in various genres making tales such as these which will last forever.Cap'n Tivendale at your service.www.youandibooks.wordpress.com"

        "user_review": "\"Dooty is dooty, to be sure.\"When I first picked up this book, I immediately liked it, for it offered a mix of mystery, adventure and combat, but unfortunately for me, that feeling got lost somewhere in the middle. To be specific, it was during Jim's ship maneuvering part that I found the story to drift away from the pace it maintained up to that. For me, the story hardly made up for it in the latter half of the book. By no means this is a poor story, for it offers quite a long story in a considerably shorter narrative, but I found the certain sections were over-described, resulting in a break in the flow of story."

        "user_review": "Remember when pirates briefly became ironically cool, and all of your annoying friends were joining facebook groups for International Talk Like A Pirate Day? And the first Pirates of the Carribbean movie came out and was surprisingly awesome? And then the second Pirates of the Carribbean movie came out and was decidedly less awesome, but you didn't really realize it until the third one came out and you discovered you couldn't remember and didn't care about number two's cliffhanger ending (it was like The Matrix in that way actually)? And then you finally saw the third one on DVD when you were home from the hospital after almost dying of mono,who knew that could happen, but apparently it really messes with your liver, and the movie was so bad you couldn't even stay awake through the literally 45-minute long action sequence that caps it all off, and besides, it makes no sense at all, with everyone betraying everyone else so many times you need a flow chart to follow the plot?I suppose we have RLS and Treasure Island to blame for all that. Because this is the book that established what we think of when we think of pirates, from skull & crossbones banners to peg legs to squawking shoulder-mounted parrots to maps with big red Xs and yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. It's kind of weird to think about: those concepts are so ingrained in our culture (see: International Talk Like a Pirate Day), and yet they all stem from this rather innocuous adventure story for children.But it is a really great adventure, which is probably why it became so iconic. This book is 130 years old but exhibits none of the mustiness of late Victorian-era fiction (turgid description being the chief offender, which you know if you've tried to slog through Jules Verne, and how in the world do you make submarines and sea monsters boring? Ask Jules). The adventure clips along quite nicely, moving from murder and mayhem on dry land to mutiny and more murder on the sea, and then to a creepy island filled with treasure and other dangers. Long John Silver is a crafty and compelling villain, switching sides more often than Benjamin Linus (hey, speaking of islands). Even though I knew basically where the story was going, it was a fast and engaging read, with a lot of creative sequences of suspense.The only sections that bogged down a bit were the brief but somewhat technical descriptions of the ship, the sails, how the waves turned it this way and that, etc. I don't know starboard from port, and I don't care to, RLS. So get back to the parts with the talking parrot."

I also remember that I read it while on Spring Break in Florida - so it was kind of cool to read this while in a somewhat tropical climate. I remember that I liked it okay, but when you are reading it for school, you sometimes cannot trust a lukewarm memory of a book.In this case, my memory was spot on!I can describe this book two ways:- An okay seafaring/pirate tale that will probably be loved by hardcore pirate fans and people who like nautical tales- TediousWhen I mentioned it was tedious to my wife, she asked if it was repetitive. But, repetitive is not quite right. More like each scene/part of the book is drawn out to the point I was relieved when it moved on. Kind of surprising as it is not all that long of a book. If you are anything like me you will spend a lot of your time thinking \"Get on with it!\"One interesting \"Ah-ha\" moment I had: As you may know, this book features Long John Silver. In my mind, and probably most peoples' minds, he is a famous pirate from a famous pirate book and there is a seafood chain named after him. The ah-ha, and maybe this was not intentional, is that his cover in the book is that he is a cook on the boat. So, naming a restaurant after him makes perfect sense!"

        "user_review": "Nuevamente, y por la naturaleza de este libro que leí, decidí \"embarcarme\" en una novela de aventuras. Luego de leer \"Robur, el Conquistador\" de Julio Verne, uno de mis ídolos literarios de la niñez, necesitaba releer éste, algo que yo había hecho hace treinta años atrás y por eso decidí comprar la edición de Penguin Clásicos. Muchas veces me sucede que ciertas novelas de argumento complicado o desenlace trágico me saturan y me es necesario alivianar un poco la carga, despejándome con una que me haga disfrutar del placer de la lectura nuevamente.Siempre consideré a Robert Louis Stevenson un gran escritor. Ha quedado un poco a la sombra de los grandes novelistas sin que eso haya mermado su calidad literaria a través de tantos años. En una acalorada frase resume cómo se sentía al respecto cuando declara en una carta a un amigo\"Que escriban sus malditas obras maestras para ellos y me dejen en paz!\".Con una buen cantidad de cuentos, la pequeña e inolvidable nouvelle, \"El extraño caso del Dr. Jekyll y Mr. Hyde\" y este libro le fue suficiente para ser recordado por siempre. Existen otras novelas y cuentos también célebres como \"El Diablo en la Botella\", \"La Flecha Negra\" o \"Las Nuevas Mil y una Noches\" que están también a la altura de otros títulos de su obra, pero este libro y el de Jekyll y Hyde fueron los que quedaron en la memoria y el corazón del lector.Stevenson reconoce que se inspiró en otras novelas y sin necesidad de plagiarlas, creó la historia de \"La Isla del Tesoro\" a partir de un mapa que dibujó junto al hijo de su esposa, llamado Sam \"Lloyd\" Osbourne y a quien quería mucho, además de tomar como modelo para su personaje Long John Silver a su mejor amigo, W.E. Henley, quien era cojo de una pierna:\"Fue el verte en acción con tu fuerza mutilada y tu carisma dominante lo que engendró a John Silver\".En lo que a este libro respecta, Stevenson, lector asiduo, tomó lo mejor de novelistas como Washington Irving, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe y aspectos del cuento \"El Escarabajo de Oro\" de Edgar Allan Poe para darle forma a su propia novela. En esa época era moneda corriente encontrarse con libros como \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Los Viajes de Gulliver\" o \"La Narrativa de Arthur Gordon Pym\" para utilizar como plataforma de salto a cualquier nueva aventura en el mar y fue clave para Stevenson leer un libro que le regalara su amigo Henley, llamado \"Historia general de los robos y asesinatos de los más famosos piratas\", escrito por un tal Johnson.Con todo ese material, Stevenson se embarcó en el proyecto de escritura que sufriría un parate ante la pérdida de inspiración deteniendo su publicación por partes en el \"Young Folks\", una revista literaria muy de moda para jóvenes en esos años.Por mi parte, me es difícil despegarme de alguien que ha escrito varias novelas sobre el mar, los barcos y las experiencias de los hombres que se subieron a ellos y me refiero a uno de mis escritores predilectos: Herman Melville.Puedo asegurar que el personaje principal de esta narración, Jim Hawkins posee el deseo de aventura de Ishmael en \"Moby Dick,\" corre los peligros de \"Billy Budd\" y tiene la audacia innata de \"Israel Potter\", todas ellas escritas por Melville y protagonizadas por personajes arrastrados a situaciones tan peligrosas para ponerlos a prueba y transformarlos rápidamente en hombres aún siendo adolescentes inexpertos.En este libro aparecen personajes maravillosos. El de Hawkins es un caso. Es un adolescente intrépido, del que estimamos posee entre doce y quince años de edad y del que supongo fue creado por Stevenson para homenajear a su hijastro. Otro personaje digno de admiración es el doctor Livesey, de una entereza intachable a lo largo de todo el libro. Sus valores permanecen inalterables. Junto a él, el caballero Trewlaney y el capitán Smollet conforman un grupo de hombres notables que jamás se rendirán ante las vicisitudes de los motines y de las sangrientas acciones que se desarrollan promediando el libro.Por el otro lado, nos encontraremos a personajes que tendrán mucho que ver a lo largo de la historia. Desde el primer bucanero, el viejo capitán Billy Bones, pasando por distintos piratas menores como Hands, Merry, O'Brien y Anderson, y especialmente quien descolla como el personaje más complejo de la historia y que es el mismísimo Long John Silver. Es un hombre que fluctúa entre el bien y el mal, entre la ambición y el deber y a quien veremos debatirse entre ir a buscar el tesoro y salirse con su obsesiva intención de quedarse con toda esa fortuna en caso de encontrarlo. Rápidamente, la codicia del \"hombre de fortuna\", que es definición del pirata, le ganará la compulsa en su cabeza para amotinarse a bordo de laHyspaniola, la goleta que los llevará a la isla en donde supuestamente se encuentra ese que dejara escondido el famoso Capitán Flint junto con el mapa para llegar a él.Mención final para Ben Gunn, un personaje del que no contaré mucho para quien no haya leído el libro aún, pero que tiene mucho que ver el transcurso de la historia.Este libro me ha llevado de vuelta a mi infancia, a mi adolescencia y a la época en que no hacía otra cosa más que leer los libros de aventura que tanto me gustaban.Y ustedes se preguntarán: ¿Y el tesoro? ¿Por qué esta reseña no dice nada acerca de él? ¿Lo encuentran o no?Bueno, como en varios pasajes del libro dicen la frase\"Los muertos no muerden\", me transformaré en una tumba y no comentaré nada por respeto al lector que quiera seguir los pasos de Jim Hawkins y su atrapante aventura en busca de \"La Isla del Tesoro\", así que... ¡todos a bordo!"

There is an adventure, violence (hilly), boats, good and bad guys, maps, treasure, and pirates! At that age, there is something profoundly evocative in words like a pirate, ambush, musket, and so forth, and I have remembered Jim's adventures with great pleasure over the years.I decided to reread it in a fit of nostalgia, even though I was genuinely worried that I would enjoy it again. However, it is even better, as have all the elements I remembered from childhood. Still, now I can appreciate it on a different level and see that it is not all adventure on the high seas, and Treasure Island is a book with live and complex characters. Long John Silver continues the charismatic bandit I remember, and although he is a villain who cheats on Jim, we can not help liking him.You might say that Treasure Island will not be accessible to toddlers today, but this book is immediately available to any child with imagination and attention for over 2 minutes. In the same way, grown children will also like it because they can revive their childhood a little."

        "user_review": "As Indiana Jones once, rather astutely pointed out, when it comes to treasure \"X never, ever marks the spot\". Well, it does if you're a pirate, which basically means that as a pirate you have a statistically much higher chance of finding treasure than any archaeologist ever would. I find this a bit unfortunate and if someone had presented me with this hard and fast evidence I would have ticked the pirate box and not the archaeologist box on my careers worksheet at school. Instead, I have to make do with reading Treasure Island and fantasising about my ideal bespoke treasure island (emeralds growing on trees- I know this is an arboreal unlikelihood but it's my fantasy so back off; lagoons filled with sapphires, gold dubloons in huge heapy piles at the foot of azure blue waterfalls and knuckle sized diamonds to be chipped off the walls of underground caverns).Stevenson's Treasure Island is much less of a Disney-esque fantasy and Jim Hawkins, narrator and salty sea dog in the making, is forced to pit his wits against the wiliest of all pirates, Long John Silver in a race to retrieve the booty. After finding an oil-skin map in a dead mans chest (nice Robert, very nice) Jim sets off to find some trustworthy (or gullible) adults. Jim must be in possession of some serious powers of persuasion because within minutes the good squire and his associates are rustling up a ship (no mean feat when a schooner could set you back £6000 and your chance of surviving the voyage was slim), tightening their buckanneering belts and getting ready to hit the high seas. It turns out the ships cook is more than he seems though and not to be underestimated (I wonder if JF Lawton, the writer of Under Siege was a Treasure Island fan, after all he served up Casey Rybeck, the most underestimated ships cook of all time).Caribbean capers ensue as Long John Silver serves up a melting pot of mendacity in an attempt to get his hand on Captain Flint's treasure. Jim Hawkins proves he's tougher than a soused herring that's been at the bottom of a barrel for a year and successfully repels the Island siege before hoisting the main sail, jibing -ho and heading for Britain. The other pirates are left marooned as a punishment and their skeletons will be unearthed 250 years from the time of telling during the construction of a Sandals adult holiday resort. Personally I think I'd rather be marooned than go to Sandals."

        "user_review": "Motivations to readTreasure Islandhave been pinging me all my life. Most recently I readHenry James's famous essay \"The Art of Fiction,\" in which he says \"I have just been reading . . . the delightful story of Treasure Island, by Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson.\" That got me recalling all the favorable mentions of Stevenson in good old Jorge Luis Borges'Selected Non-Fictions. More recently, while streamingBlade Runner 2049, I decided to throw in the towel when Rick Deckerd says to Officer K \"'You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?'\" which is an allusion toTreasure Island's desperate Ben Gunn. Thus, was I finally sent regressing. Well, not really; I'd never read it as a boy. And neither, says James, is it a book solelyforboys. It's a book for all ages, rather like Defoe'sRobinson Crusoe. Read it. It's pure narrative pleasure—a treasure in itself.A great joy is the suspense, but also the description of passing across the landscape. This is a gift all the great novelists share—Gabriel García-Márquez,Thomas Hardy,Edith Wharton,V.S. Naipaulspring to mind. Here's a favorite passage as the search for the treasure finally begins:Heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation, greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot. It was, indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment of our senses. (p. 166)"

        "user_review": "Book Review4 out of 5 stars toTreasure Island, a coming-of-age-of-sort novel, written in 1882 byRobert Louis Stevenson. I read this book as a young adult when I received it as a Christmas present from an aunt and uncle. At first, although I knew it was a classic, I wasn't too anxious to jump into it. I wasn't a big fan of pirates and boats. I wasn't a normal kid, what can I tell you. But... it was a gift and I thought I should give it a chance. And once I did, I loved it. I had read Peter Pan recently and felt a kismet connection of sorts between them. From the adventures to the bonds, to the test of good versus evil, the book had so many wonderful moments. And since then, I've sampled many different iterations, from movies to other books with pirate stories, all the way to Once Upon a Times interpretation. It's truly a remarkable story that helps young adults figure out how to approach a world full of fears, hopes and questions. And to think it's a pirate and a cook who help you to figure some of it out. But it's more. There's bonding. And team work. And treasure hunting. And challenges. And mystery. All culminating in reaching one's goals in ways you didn't necessarily expect.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

        "user_review": "Quick summary:Jim Hawkins lives at the Admiral Benbow Inn, with his parents, in an English seaside town. A man named Billy Bones comes to the inn to rent a room and begins conversing with young Jim. During their discussion, Billy warns Jim to be wary of a one-legged man. Billy is confronted by buccaneers who threaten his life, and then Jim discovers a treasure map. Others know about the map too and want to locate it, but Jim is able to hide with it for the time being. Young Jim, along with a crew, head out on a seafaring adventure to find Captain Flint's treasure before anyone else does.My thoughts:Treasure islandis an exciting adventure novel published in 1883 by Robert Louis Stevenson. The story is about buried treasure, pirates, and mutiny. It's a coming of age story with iconic characters and an intriguing plot.This story is driven heavily by the plot, but the characters are all interesting. My personal favorite was Jim Hawkins, the primary narrator of the story. Jim is an honest character—far from perfect, and he doesn't hide it. He accepts his mistakes and learns from them. It is young Jim's perspective that makes this a coming-of-age story and leads to many plot twists. There is substantial character development with Jim and how he begins to better understand himself and the world around him.My son's favorite character was Long John Silver and for good reason. He is the antagonist in the story. Intelligent, courageous and charming—he's the villain you find yourself siding with throughout the story. Witnessing the skill of these characters and knowing their capabilities was one of my favorite aspects of this story. This book brought us to the controversial question:who is the hero?This story was amusing for all my kids because they haven't read many pirate stories. It was a nice change and never boring. They were excited to read it and enjoyed discovering all the parts in the book that Disney took and adapted intoPirates of the Caribbean.I remember reading this book as a child in our school library. It was likely the first pirate story I'd ever read. As an adult reader, this book still held my interest today. It's full of action and adventure, and it's written well. While I didn't love it, it was still an enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good escape read or one who enjoys immersing themselves in adventures—especially seafaring, pirate stories. This illustrated edition along with the audio by Neil Hunt brought this book to life."

        "user_review": "\"If you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!\"\"Treasure Island\" is a novel I had not read since I was a teenager. I had forgotten about it frankly. Then while I was rereading it this time, images from past readings and the iconic Disney 1950 film (which I devoured as a kid) were jogged back into my mind by the words I was reading. The youthful fear I felt about the treacherous Israel Hands, the frustration at Squire Trelawney's big mouth, and others all came roaring back at me. It was a very pleasant experience.On this reading, I appreciated the world Robert Louis Stevenson created, and I was impressed by his use of dialect and dialogue to establish and distinguish character. It is really well done. You can tell a lot about Long John Silver or the castaway Ben Gunn by the manner in which they speak.On top of that, it is just a ripping good yarn that also happens to be well written. It is not often that the two go together. The book keeps your attention and I found myself wanting to pick it up and read.A note about the Barnes & Noble classics edition…the Introduction by Angus Fletcher is overwrought and pretentious and adds nothing to your enjoyment of the text. Skip it.I have returned to \"Treasure Island\" after many years. I will be returning again."

And may IAnd all my pirates share the graveWhere these and their creations lie!I honestly don't remember if I ever actually readTreasure Islandas a kid. Between various movies (Muppet and otherwise), it's a story that's just part of popular culture. Practically every pirate stereotype comes from this novel. Buried treasure, and a map to that treasure where X literally marks the spot. Mutiny. Drunk pirates. Peg legs. A talking parrot on the shoulder. \"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest—Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\"Robert Louis Stevensonreportedly wrote this book for his 12-year-old son, and I don't consider it an insult to say that it reads that way. The protagonist, Jim Hawkins, is a young man caught between the mutinous pirates, led by the charismatic Long John Silver, and the smaller band of honest men, led by honest Captain Smollet. The book is full of action sequences, narrow escapes, crosses and double-crosses. It's not subtle, and outside of Long John Silver—whose complexity is the only real wrinkle to the story—the characters are exactly who they seem to be.As an adult, I preferred readingThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which is a much more serious story exploring the duality of human nature and the struggle within each of us between good and evil. ButTreasure Islandis every bit as timeless and influential; it's simply written for a younger audience. The fact that one person created both of these classics is remarkable. If you've never read it before, or are looking for a classic action-adventure tale, it's recommended."

The adventures of Jim Hawkins and his friends, the treasure hunt, and pirates would have been alluring to my young mind. No matter, I'm happy that I read it at last.The book really surprised me. I expected a complete children's story. But this is not so. It has a mature substance. There is treachery, mutiny, and murder to please the mature audience while there are adventure and heroism to please both young and adult audiences.Jim Hawkins was a likable hero. His friends - the doctor, the captain, and the squire were an interesting lot and a good blend to the story. I was also taken in by the pirates, especially the cunning and double-dealing John Silver.It was a fun and exciting read, overall, and I enjoyed it."

Late in the voyage he discovers that most of the ship's crew are pirates with the worst one of all (Long John Silver) appearing to be his close friend.image:The Treasure MapThe paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain's pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked \"The Spy-glass.\" There were several additions of a later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink—two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest—and beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain's tottery characters, these words: \"Bulk of treasure here.\"Promises kept?\"Ah,\" said Silver, \"it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here.

Es una historia de piratas metida en una historia de marineros. Jim allí tendrá que usar todo su ingenio y su poca resistencia física si no quiere caer abatido a manos de los salvajes pero simplones piratas, ser arrojado a los peces o torturado. Al ser una historia para niños Stevenson suavizó digamos la historia, no es algo que necesariamente hunda la historia, me gustan ver novelas bien escritas, tal vez simples pero con el hilo de la narración muy bien llevado como en este caso. Sin descripciones extraordinarias ni monólogos abundantes pero que sin embargo nos explica bien las inquietudes y deseos de los que allí navegan.Es como un acertijo ir descubriendo lo que se traman, sus planes, y eso la verdad me pareció interesante. A pesar de todo me gustó mucho la habilidad de Jim y su osadía para actuar frente a los piratas, me encantó también cómo está dibujado Jhon El Largo con su astucia, verborrea y crueldad sin parangón. Se establece una relación admiración-odio entre Jim y el viejo cocinero, un duelo, casi una complicidad. Eso me pareció lo más profundo de la novela.En suma una historia sencilla, no tan épica, pero que sin embargo me sirvió para pensar nuevamente en leer más libros de aventuras."

I've been saving this book for Fiji, and here I now am and what better place to read Treasure Island than on a island in the Pacific.I am always moaning that classics are over descriptive and wordy, not this one, which was a bit of a shame as I was looking forward to being able to envision the island in my head but that wasn't the case. This is an action lead plot so the surroundings dont get a lot of air play at all.I had no idea what this book was going to be like other than there would be treasure on a island and it wasnt what I was expecting at all, in my head it was going to be a bit Secret Seven but it was actually a bit more grown up than that.A quick read at less than 200 pages which I found perfect for island reading.Ahoy pirates!"

        "user_review": "I have no doubt that this book damaged me, psychologically, as a small child. It is one of the earliest books I vividly remember reading aloud to myself, and I remember the first time my mother read it to me before she put me to bed. Here's the gist of the plot: A little boy named Max dresses up in a wolf costume, plays with a hammer, chases his dog with a fork, then threatens to cannibalize his mother. His mother, a master of irony, then puts him to bed with no dinner. Already, this story should start creeping you out. Then a forest starts to grow in Max's bedroom. And no, no chemicals have been ingested anywhere in the story. Though the bit about chasing the dog with the fork does imply a delusional state. Regardless, a fucking forest grows in the kids bedroom. So naturally he gets in a boat and sails off to the other side of the world, to where all these \"wild things\" are. And promptly subjugates everyone he sees. I'm a damn toddler, and my mom is reading me a book about a sociopath. So Max has a ball with this gang he's conquered and converted, and they howl at the moon and hop through trees. Then he gets hungry and goes home, where his mother, no doubt terrified of his new army of foreign creatures, has left his food for him, still warm. I thought, \"This woman aims to do me harm.\" Yes, please, mother. Read me a story about my bedroom becoming a forest inhabited by monsters, then put me to bed. Think I slept that night? No, I hid out under my bed with a plastic baseball bat, a water gun and flashlight, hoping to God that if this was the night it all went wrong, I had the courage to look those monsters in the eye and pretend I wasn't wetting myself. I made a nest with a giant teddy bear and two pillows and didn't come out until the next morning, when I heard my mom coming down the hall. All day long I pretended nothing was different. But I asked her to read me Where The Wild Things Are again that night. And the next night. For months. I would ask her questions like \"Do you think I will have my monsters get you if you don't make me supper?\" And she'd smile, and say \"Go to bed, Nathan.\" Spooky shit, I'm telling you. I learned to read through fear and intimidation. A subversive masterpiece.NC"

And I also with all my heart appreciate the message the author promotes here, a message of unconditional love, a message that even if one misbehaves, there will be supper waiting on the table (Max does get sent to his room, but no matter how much he has misbehaved, his mother will always love him and cherish him). Of course, that particular message is only one of many. As essential as the concept of universal love is the philosophy, is the attitude that children's emotions and tantrums are to be taken seriously and not ever simply dismissed. Max might be seen and chastised as a \"wild thing\" by his mother, but his emotions, his actions are described as an integral part of his being, maybe not quite appropriate, but also not completely inappropriate, rather as a living, breathing part of Max's being. And it is these emotions, these feelings that are the impetus to Max's adventures in the realm of the Wild Things. However, once Max's emotions have been allowed and have flourished to the maximum, he retreats from the realm of the Wild Things and is happy to return home to his room, his waiting supper and his mother's love.I guess I should really mention that one of my more recent rereads ofWhere the Wild Things Are(in 2011 for the Picture Book Club in the Children's Literature Group) was the first time I had actually read this book in English. Prior to 2011, I had only ever read it in German translation, and I have to admit that I actually like the translated German version somewhat better than the original English. For those who know me, this is quite a contrary attitude, as I am as a rule very much in favour of original texts and keeping any translated narratives as close to the original as possible. In this particular case, I think that I appreciate the German translation more because it is the narrative that I had repeatedly read to me when I was a child, that I later read for myself (and in 2005 read to my young nieces). The German translation ofWhere the Wild Things Aretherefore has a nostalgic hold on me that the Maurice Sendak's original text, no matter how ingenious, not matter that it is the master, the primordial, will simply never have (and for me, the ultimate version of this book will always, always be the German translation,Wo Die Wilden Kerle Wohnen."

Polyphemus.Which makes Max's mom a stand-in for Penelope, keeping his dinner hot for him as he sails \"in and out of weeks and almost over a year,\" and that's a little weird but there's always something a little weird about Maurice Sendak, isn't there? Have you readIn the Night Kitchen?It's fuckin' weird, man. None of this knocksWhere the Wild Things Areany lower on the list of Great Children's Literature, where it is#1.It's everything, right? The way Sendak writes - everything is a little effortlessly different. He startsin media res,\"The night Max wore his wolf suit...\" I like to evolve the way I say wild things - in the beginning I put the emphasis like \"wildThings,\" and then I switch it up to the Hendrixian \"Wildthings\" as we build to this:\"And now,\" cried Max,\"let the wild rumpus start!\"Which honestly, can you think of a better sentence in all of literature? I'm being serious! I can't. This is my favorite one.You ever notice how the pictures get bigger? Max making mischief of one kind and another is just a little picture on the page, but by the time the wild rumpus gets going it's full page spreads, there's not even room for any words. And those creatures! You've probably heard how Sendak modeled them on his family. Look how awesome they are.Which one is your favorite? I like the hippie in the back.And of course it's great because, like the best children's books, it takes children seriously. Max is being an asshole. Dude chased the dog with a fork, what the fuck. His mother punishes him and he learns zero lessons, he just plays in his room until she gives in. That's a plot a kid can dig! Children can tell when a book is writtenfor themand when it's writtenat them.This is for children. It has magic in it, and so do they."

        "user_review": "Where the Wild Things AreWhat's the moral of this story? Some might say Sendack's work is a testament to the unbridled powers of a child's imagination. Others would posit that the true virtue of Where the Wild Things Are stems from the reversal of a timeless power dynamic in which monsters frighten children. In Sendack's carefully rendered world, monsters submit to the whims of children, which appears to suit Max well enough. I assume it works well for other children as well. If you can't convince snot-nosed brats that monsters don't exist, at least you can convince them that monsters are friendly. Children, after all, are like neo-conservatives. You can only reason with them on their own delusional terms.Here's the summary:Max is an asshole. His mother calls him a monster, so he flies into a cannibalistic rage. She sends him to his room without dinner, which doesn't seem to be the best of ideas since he just threatened to eat her f*&% face off, but whatever. This book isn't heralded as a classic because of its promotion of high-quality parenting techniques. I'll get to that in a moment.I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the story of Max and the early years of Siddhartha. Both starve themselves until they hallucinate. But the similarities end there. Siddhartha realizes that his approach to transcendentalism is misguided, and he eats once more. Max, on the other hand, starves himself for a night and trees grow in his room. Then he proceeds to get on a boat and fast for an entire year, at which point he starts seeing giant monsters.The fact that these monsters cater to his delusions of grandeur--cowering in his presence and sharing his flesh-eating inclinations--lets us know that Max has externalized his fantasy world through strict fasting. On one hand, I respect this kid. I can rarely push through four days without wheat before the weekend starts and I pack in 80lbs of corporate-grown meat and bleached bread. On the other hand, what the hell is this book teaching our children? I'll tell you.That middle finger means \"I was raised on Sendak!\"Aside from self-imposed starvation, the book teaches children to give up on their aspirations as soon as the slightest temptation arises: \"he smelled good things to eat so he gave up being king.\" It sends the message that those who love you would just as happily rip your entrails out and feast upon them as soon as you decide to leave: \"Oh please don't go-we'll eat you up-we love you so!\" And, finally, it shows them that parents' threats are temporally limited, and eventually love will cause them to cave in. At the end of the story, Max returns to his room \"where he found his supper waiting for him.\" Way to be strong, mom. Pushover.I bet Satan loves this book."

But sooner or later, they'll come around.I see quite a few people complaining about Max being a little shit and not learning a lesson in \"Where the Wild Things Are.\" Well, guess what, a lot of kids are little shits. And I believe Max did learn a few things on his journey. Sometimes it's not so good to be the king. Even with all his power over the wild things, he still missed home. And even when he's bad, he can count on his Mama. That's a lesson in appreciating what you got. It's too bad people have to be so one-dimensional about children's books -- but given the amount of 4 & 5-star reviews this book gets on Goodreads alone, I'm certain the naysayers are way off the mark... Anyway, just had to say that."

My cousin was in kindergarden and I was being babysat by my aunt, busy in the kitchen downstairs - might as well have been miles away. The bedroom shades were drawn, the house quiet, the room empty. That book with its-its things in it called to me. I'd never seen anything like it. My books had colorful, happy animals that didn't make me feel this way....what was this feeling? Was this what was known as fear? And what were those things? Were they, maybe, those things called monsters? I'd not fully experienced fear before, perhaps because I'd not put a face on it. I crept closer. Those faces looked mean, ferocious. I stopped in the middle of the room, neither advancing towards the book, nor fleeing. I was terrified...and I loved it!Appendixed!: It's Maurice Sendak's birthday today. (Thanks Google!) If he hadn't died last year, he would be 85 now....85 crusty old years. Right around the time he died NPR was playing archival interviews of him. It was the first time I'd heard him speak. I could've done without the experience. I have nothing against his voice, rather the things that come out of his mouth. The man was curmudgeonly to the core it seems. I can be a bit of a pill myself sometimes, so I should cut him some slack, but I was surprised by his grouchiness. I suppose I always assume children's authors are bright, cheerful sorts. Heck, they write happy little stories about colorful, good-hearted characters that usually come out on top. How could such stuff come from a sourpuss? Well, Sendak was proof that it can. Hm. That's funny. I'm 40 and I'm still learning things from children's lit."

        "user_review": "Through a Child's Eye(A Book Review of Maurice Sendak'sWhere The Wild Things Are)I'm glad that I recently scored a vintage 1963 edition (pictures here) of Maurice Sendak'sWhere the Wild ThingsAre in Booksale during one of the mini Meet Ups with my Goodreads-The Filipino Group friends. I breeze through the book in a matter of minutes while waiting for them, and right there and then something just hit me. Without a doubt, it certainly earns its place as a classic storybook of Children's Literature.Where the Wild Things Aretells the story of the rascal Max, who dresses up in his wolf suit and causes trouble enough to make his mother order him to go to bed without supper at all. As the title alludes, the picture book shows a child's unbound and limitless wild rumpus of an imagination exhibited when Max reaches deeper within his imagining and sees his room transformed into a forest inhabited by the Wild Things — roaring and gnashing monsters with yellow eyes, sharp teeth and horns — where he, by a mere stare, can tame and be the king of them all.I think what endears every child who reads Sendak's picture book is that most of them can identify with Max's feeling of resentment, that though he had had his share of fun out of it, he eventually grows weary and lonely, permitting him later on to go back to the place where he most wants to be and appreciate the most important thing he left behind: the need to feel loved.At home, after a tiring yet fun-filled day with friends and before hitting the sack, I'm still at it, staring mesmerized by Sendak's impressive work of art with its muted colors and cross-hatchings, that looks like sketches, add further magic, energy and excitement to every kid who reads it they would love to be in the shoes of Max, playing with the Wild Things on their \"wild rumpus\" where they can howl at the moon and swing from tree to tree in bold celebration of all the wildness they possess.I rue the fact that I stumbled upon this picture book well into my manhood, but it definitely touched something in me — the book has this uncanny ability to enchant itself to the nostalgic memory of childhood, rekindling its innermost emotions. It's as if I'm seeing the world again through a child's eye.Nevertheless, this is a book worth keeping — for every reading always brings a new perspective, a nuanced view of the book's message — which I will one day read to my future children and let them discover for themselves a world of their own creation; a world where the wild things are, where only they has the power to tame._________________________Book Details: Book#24for 2011Published by Harper & Row, Publishers(Hardcover, 1963 First Edition)42 pagesRead on: June 15, 2011My Rating: ★★★★★[See this review on my book blogDark Chest of Wondersand for many others.]"

        "user_review": "Ayn Rand makes my eyes hurt. She does this, not by the length of her six hundred thousand word diatribe, but rather by the frequency with which she causes me to roll them. Do you want to know what I've learned after spending nearly two months reading Ayn Rand's crap? Here's a brief rundown,Breakfast of Championsstyle.Socialists are scary. Socialists are frightening creatures who lurk in corners, waiting to pounce on you. They are unpredictable, they have curvature of the spine, and they often foam at the mouth.This is a socialist:Capitalists, on the other hand, are calm and rational beings who never lose their tempers. You can always trust a capitalist. And they are super easy to spot, too—just look for the hummingbirds who sew their clothes for them.This is a capitalist:Ayn Rand's characters come in only two flavors, and which kind you get depends solely on the extent to which they embody her philosophical ideals. The capitalists (the \"good guys\") are the moral heroes of the story, the ones who fight back against economic regulation. This regulation is seen as unwanted intervention, the government essentially trespassing on one's property rights by means of unfair (unfair to thecapitalists, I might point out) legislation. The \"bad guys\" are, of course, represented by the socialists—the ones passing the legislation, although Rand does a good job of throwing anyone else into this category who, while not active participants in passing these laws, may not be totally opposed to them, either.The problem with all of this is the fact that her characters are not at all believable. They are robots who mechanically spew forth her inane drivel or, if they are of theotherflavor, behave in a manner so utterly ridiculous as to demonstrate the rationality of the capitalist over the vicious, gun-toting socialist who's come to rob your house, rape your Ma, and shoot your Pa. Rand is so egregious in the maltreatment of her antithetic characters that it's almost laughable. Beyond that, the narrative itself is monotonous and repetitive. This is not exactly a beach read.But even if I were to put all of that aside, I still wouldn't be able to get over the fact that Rand's argument here is to put an end to social collectivism ofevery form. That means: no social security, no unemployment insurance, no federally funded health care, no public roads, no public housing, no public education, no income taxes, no property taxes—does this not sound insane?! I get the whole \"ooh\" and \"aah\" aspect of libertarian freedoms, but I'm betting there wouldn't be a lot of volunteers willing to relinquish their adequately funded public services on the basis of a free market economy. And ultimately, this is the fundamental principle on which Rand and I disagree. Although I do believe, and strongly, that the government should have no authority to interfere in the private lives of its citizens, do I think the government should also abstain from interfering in the regulation of the economy? Hellz, no! I want those corporate mother fuckers taxed and if that means Ima start foaming at the mouth, then so be it.Ultimately, this novel is more absurdist fiction than dystopian fiction. Rand takes an all-in-or-all-out approach to problem solving; there can be no moral ambiguity—either you're with her or you're not, and I'm not. But what does she care? Rand is an unabashed admirer of the wealthy industrialist and it is forhimthat she bats her eyes and licks her lips, not for me."

        "user_review": "This book really makes you take a good hard look at yourself and your behavior, which is why I think a lot of people don't like this book. It's a lecture and most people don't like to get lectured. I loved it. It gave me a good swift kick in the ass. While I've never been a \"looter,\" I have made several irrational decisions in my life, which this 1000+ page lecture has helped me to stop doing. It teaches you to think with your mind, rather than your heart. It doesn't make you an uncaring person. You still feel with your heart, but you think with your mind. Use your mind instead of expecting to get the rewards of others who do all the thinking. If everyone did this, the world would be perfect - that is the idea behind Ayn's story. Of course, this will never happen. Ayn knew that. She just wrote a story about her ideal world. A lot of authors do that. No need to get pissed off at her because of it.Yes, the book is wordy, but her words are genius in my opinion. I loved the long radio speech. Skip it if you are hating the book or better yet, stop reading it. Go out and smell the flowers instead. Is the story black and white? Definitely. Authors have different styles - people complain. If every author wrote in the same style, people would complain.I can't tell you how many co-workers I've met who complain about how the CEO is making so much money and they should get some of that money. Well, go to college, get a business degree and work you're way up the corporate ladder if you want the CEO's salary. Don't sit around and expect those kinds of rewards because you work in accounts payable. You know what it takes, so do it and shut up. If it wasn't for the person who created this company, you wouldn't even have a job. I'm an administrative assistant making less money than the people complaing about wanting more money. It just makes me sick. But the people in Ayn's story didn't work for money. They loved their jobs. And she wasn't saying you had to be a rich, corporate big shot to hold the world up. There were teachers and stay at home moms in her little world in the mountains.Ayn has extremely valuable points and if you are someone who is constantly looking for something to criticize in every book, then don't read it. If you can't handle looking at your imperfections, don't read it. If you have an open mind and are willing to learn something from every book and experience you have and grow as a person, then you will benefit from reading this book."

        "user_review": "Ayn Rand's characters are almost completely defined by the extent to which they embrace her beliefs. A good guy by definition is someone who agrees with her; a bad guy someone who dares to have a different point of view. For all the lip-service Rand pays to individualism, she brooks no dissent from her heroes; none of her so-called individualists ever expresses a point of view significantly different from hers.To illustrate the gulf between Rand's characters and human reality, consider this behavior. When Dagny Taggart meets Hank Rearden, she dutifully becomes his property, for no other reason than that he's the most Randian male around. When John Galt arrives, ownership of the prize female transfers from Rearden to Galt, because Galt is the more Randian of the two. Does it ever occur to Hank to be resentful or jealous? Does Taggart experience loyalty or regret? Might Taggart love Rearden despite his lesser Randness? No, those are all things that human beings might feel.(In a related departure from reality, sex in Randland is more or less indistinguishable from rape. Foreplay? Romance? Capitalists don't have time for that commie nonsense.)The real focus ofAtlas Shruggedis to extoll Rand's philosophy. (Not to debate it, since no one in Randland with any any intelligence or competence could have a different point of view.) About Rand's philosophy I'll just make two points (which I'm not going to bother providing evidence for at the moment).The first is that, like most social Darwinists, Rand fell short in her understanding of natural selection. Her philosophy was largely based on the false belief that nature invariably favors individual selfishness. In reality, evolution has made homo sapiens a social animal; cooperation and compassion are very human traits. More importantly, even if cold selfishness were man's nature in the wild, it wouldnotnecessarily follow that that would be the best way for us to behave in our semi-civilized modern condition.The second point is that, contrary to Rand's belief, pure laissez-faire capitalism never works; it invariably leads to exploitation of the poor and middle class and to environmental catastrophe. The best economic system that has ever been devised -- so far -- is a mixture of capitalism and socialism."

        "user_review": "The best way to understand Rand's message in this book is to simply close it, and beat yourself over the head with it as hard as possible. This is essentially what Rand does throughout it's ridiculous length. I see no reason that a book with a strong lesson can't also have decent character development, natural dialog, and a believable plot. Of course, I also think that you can establish a theme with subtlety, and trust that your reader will figure it out. Ayn Rand writes as if the elements of fiction get in the way of her message, and that reader's skull's are extraordinarily thick and require a firm beating over the head to absorb the theme. Countless philosophers have said the same thing better (and quicker).I realize that I offend many atheists, agnostics and free thinkers by writing this, but as one myself, I have to say that a passionate love of Ayn Rand is not required for membership in that particular club. Save yourself a headache, and pick up the much shorterAnthem. It's just as overdone, but weighing it at ounces rather than pounds, it'll leave a smaller dent in your head.Oh, and if you're only reading it to answer the question on geeky bumper sticker \"Who is John Galt?\" He's the hero and a symbol of the capitalism in it's conflict over what Rand saw as the oppressive and ultimately destructive forces of large government type societies (you, know. . .socialism, fascism, etc.). It's usually stuck on the butt end of a car to express general disenchantment with big government, and a lack of heroes. Now you know, so go read something worthwhile, and if you insist on reading Ayn Rand, hit her non-fiction. Stripped of an attempt at storytelling, she doesn't do half bad."

        "user_review": "As Ayn Rand's immortal opus, Atlas Shrugged, stands as a tome to a philosophy that is relevant today as it was in her time. Basically, the major moral theme is that there are two types of people in the world: the Creators and the Leeches.The Creators are the innovators who use the power of their will and intelligence to better humanity. The first person to create fire is often referenced as the paradigm for these people. In the book, each of the major protagonists also represent Creators improving the human condition with their force of will.The Leeches (my word) are the people who create nothing, but thrive off feeding on the Creators. In Rand's view, they are the bureaucrats, politicos, regulators, etc. Throughout human history she tells us, these people have benefited through no ingenuity of their own, but merely from piggybacking on - and often fettering - the success of the Creators.Where the conflict in this book arises is when the Creators decide they have had enough and revolt. I won't spoil the book by describing specifics, but let's just say it causes quite the societal drama. For Leeches can't feed where there's no blood.All that is fairly significant and involved and worth the read to begin with, but where this book really stimulates me is in the fact that it is still relevant. Today we have Creators and we have Leeches. Some titans of industry and technology move our culture forward and others hold it back to their own benefit. I work in Silicon Valley and I see this all the time. That's why in many ways I consider this voluminous novel to be as important to a business education as Art of War.To cite other readers' posts, you don't have to agree with what Rand is extolling, but I think you'd be foolish to try and deny the existence of this struggle since it is ingrained in humanity. Yes, Ayn does get long winded and arrogant in parts as she draws the battle lines, but I don't think an author could have crafted such a powerful conflict without copious quantities of ego to accentuate the differences."

        "user_review": "Would you like to hear the only joke I've ever written? Q: \"How many Objectivists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\" A: (Pause, then disdainfully) \"Uh...one!\" And thus it is that so many of us have such a complicated relationship with the work of Ayn Rand; unabashed admirers at the age of 19, unabashedly horrified by 25, after hanging out with some actual Objectivists and witnessing what a--holes they actually are, and also realizing that Rand and her cronies were one of the guiltiest parties when it came to the 1950s \"Red Scare\" here in America. Here in Rand's second massive manifesto-slash-novel, we follow the stories of a number of Titans of the Industrial Age -- the big, powerful white males who built the railroad industry, the big, powerful white males who built the electrical utility companies -- as well as a thinly-veiled Roosevelt New Deal administration whose every attempt to regulate these Titans, according to Rand, is tantamount evil-wise to killing and eating babies, even when it's child labor laws they are ironically passing. Ultimately it's easy to see in novels like this one why Rand is so perfect for late teenagers, but why she elicits eye rolls by one's mid-twenties; because Objectivism is all about BEING RIGHT, and DROPPING OUT IF OTHERS CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, and LET 'EM ALL GO TO HELL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, without ever taking into account the unending amount of compromise and cooperation and sometimes sheer altruism that actually makes the world work. Recommended, but with a caveat; that you read it before you're old enough to know better."

        "user_review": "I was visiting an old friend for the past few days, and she showed me this cover ofAtlas ShruggedI made for her when we lived in Ukraine:[image error]It was a necessary repair, but it pretty much proves I should be a cover designer._____________________________________________Original review:I think Francisco D'Aconia is absolutely a dream boat. This book's like blah blah blah engineering, blah blah blah John Galt, blah blah blah no altruistic act, blah bla- HE-llo, Francisco D'Aconia, you growl and a half. Also, there's a pirate. So, what's everyone complaining about?Okay, it's not that I don't get what everyone's complaining about. I get that Rand is kind of loony tunes of the Glenn Beck variety, and some people (maybe?) use her to justify being assholes, but I just don't like to throw the bathwater out with that baby. Warning: I think, to make my point, I have to refer to Dostoyevsky a lot, which I seem to always do because he really is some kind of touchstone to me. The point I'm trying to make with all this blabbering is that the debate over Atlas Shrugged brings out something that I might hate more than anything else (more than weddings and kitty litter even). It makes people say that ideas are dangerous. People on all sides of the spectrum do this about different stuff, and whatever the argument, I don't like it. If an idea is wrong, say it's wrong. But genocide doesn't happen because people put forward too many ideas. It happens because people put forward too few ideas.Anyway, back to the book:First, story.The third part of this book is super weird. It's definitely not the actual ending of the book, I've decided, but more of a choose-your-own-adventure suggestion. It's kind of fun that way because any end that you, the reader, come up with will be better than the one Rand suggested. My favorite part of her ending is how John Galt gives the most boring speech possible, and it lasts for about a bazillion pages, and you have to skip it or die. Then, at the end, Rand's like, \"The entire world was listening, ears glued to the radios, because Galt's speech was the most brilliant thing they had ever heard.\" No. Nope. Nice try, liar. So, that's super lame, I agree, and you should just skip the third part.But people don't get as mad about the epilogue inCrime and Punishment. Why? That's the same situation, where it kills all fun, and you have to ignore that it happened. Is it just because it's shorter, and it's called \"Epilogue\"? Maybe that's enough. But, on the other hand, maybe people didn't read all the way to the end of Crime and Punishment. Maybe, because it was written by a crazy Russian man, not a crazy Russian woman, people think they'll sound deep if they say they like it.Second, writing.People complain about Rand's writing, and I always think, \"When was the last time you wrote a 1000 page book in a second language and pulled off a reasonably page-turning storyline?\" The woman spoke Russian for crying out loud! It most certainly would have been a better choice for her to have written the books in Russian and had them translated, but, I mean, most native English speakers couldn't be that entertaining. It's at least A for effort. I'm not going to make excuses for the unpronounceable names she chooses for her characters, but I'll just say Dostoyevsky again and leave it at that.I know it made a huge difference in my reading of this book that I was living in a Soviet bloc apartment in Lozovaya, Ukraine at the time and had forgotten a little bit how to speak English. I'm sure a lot of weird phrasing didn't sound weird to me because it makes sense in Russian. But, also, I feel like I've read a lot of translations of Dostoyevsky and other Russians that feel really weird in English. You know, everyone's always having some kind of epileptic fit or whatever with Mr. D. But, we allow for the weirdness because we picture the stuff happening in Russia, where the weird stuff typically goes down anyway. I'll tell you right now, Atlas Shrugged takes place in Russia. No joke. She might tell you they're flying over the Rocky Mountains, or whatever, but this book is a Russian if there ever was one. Just so it's clear, I LOVE that about it. That's no insult, only compliment.Third, philosophy.Maybe I told you this story already, so skip it if you already know it. When I lived in Ukraine, I had the same conversation with three or four people of the older generation who grew up in the Soviet Union. They would tell me, \"Things were really wonderful in the Soviet Union, much better than they are now. We had free health care, free housing, and now we have nothing. I mean, every once in a while your neighbor would disappear, but it was completely worth it.\" This was really disturbing to me, because it gave me this picture of the people around me – that they were the ones who ratted out the neighbors who wanted a different life. Sure, Rand's vision is narrow and sometimes inhuman, but I think it is because she was really terrified of this equally narrow and, as far as I'm concerned, inhuman vision. I want a public health care option real bad, and my neighbor has some really annoying Chihuahuas, but if forced to choose between them, I'd probably still pick my neighbor.Admittedly, the problem with this argument is that it sets up a dichotomy where our only choices are the prosperity gospel and Soilent Green. From what I know of Rand, though, she had seen her neighbors and family thrown out of Russia or killed for being rich. She was fighting something extreme by being extreme. Unfortunately, in America, this rhetoric turns into the idea that having public services = killing your neighbor. To me, this comes from people taking her arguments too seriously on both sides. Dostoyevsky has ghosts and devils coming out of every corner, and people take his stories for what they're worth. We don't think that liking his books makes us mystics and hating them makes us inquisitors. Why is it different with Rand?Fourth, women.I'm not going to lie and tell you that there weren't other badass female characters when Dagney Taggert came around. All I want to say about this is that the most valuable thing I got from this book was the idea that one person being unhappy doesn't, and shouldn't, make other people happy. I think, in this way, it was particularly important to me that the protagonist was a woman. I see a lot of women complain about their lives and families, but say it's all worth it because they've been able to devote their lives to making their husbands or children happy. I'm paraphrasing, I guess. Anyway, that kind of hegemony really creeps me out.When I read this book, I was just realizing that I had joined Peace Corps with a similarly misguided motivation. I wanted to go to the needy and unfortunate countries of the world and sacrifice myself to save them. It might sound more nasty than it really was when I say it like that, but I think it is a really arrogant attitude to have. We might have hot running water in America (for which I am forever grateful), but if somewhere doesn't have that, it's probably not because of a problem a silly, 23-year-old English major is going to solve. Don't get me wrong, I loved Peace Corps, and it was maybe the best experience of my life so far. But I love it for the things that I got out of it, and if someone else benefited from my being in Ukraine, it was dumb luck.I don't know about other women, but I was raised to believe that the more selfless (read: unhappy) I was, the better off everyone else would be. I think it's a pretty typical way that women talk themselves into staying in abusive situations – that their lives are worth less than the lives around them. This would be the Hank Rearden character in the novel. I love that Rand sets up characters who destroy this cycle of abuse. I love that her female protagonist lives completely outside of it.So, not to undercut my noble feminist apologetics, but really Francisco's just hawt, and I think that's the reason I like this book. There are lots of other reasons to read Rand, but most of those get into the argument about her ideas being dangerous. I just don't think they are, or should be. I think ignorance is dangerous, but I think it should be pretty easy to fill in the gaping holes in Rand's logic. Yes, she conveniently ignores the very old, very young, and disabled to make a specific and extreme point. I don't think her point is entirely without merit, though (in the sense that our lives are valuable, not in the sense of \"kill the weak!\"). I also think that if we give a \"danger\" label to every book that conveniently ignores significant portions of the population to make a point, we wouldn't be left with much.Anyway, read, discuss, agree, disagree. I'll be making up some \"Team John,\" \"Team Hank,\" \"Team Francisco\" t-shirts later. I hear in the sequel there are werewolves."

        "user_review": "Honestly this book isn't even worth talking about. It's a genre of its own called Dumb Dystopia. Here's my old review I guess:Recently someone told me this was their favorite novel. I believe they referred to it as 'the greatest book ever written.' I find a lot wrong with that statement. Because who cares about Ulysses, right? No, that won't do, I'm going to have to drink and rant for a moment. I refrained from commenting to the customer, because I'm sure it is typically for political reasons that people like this book and, whatever, some people swing left, some people swing right, some people suckle the golden calf of capitalism and some love thy socialist ways and who am I to judge. I'm not a politician and you should all thank me for that. I'd like to push politics aside but, frankly, I think it is solely for political reasons and edgelord posturing that this book managed to stay relevant and in print. However, I suppose you are all here to hear about the politics of this book and I would be boring you with talks of wooden character and language and overall juvenile writing abilities, so I'll save those for after. I don't want to argue politics, especially not while drinking, so lets take a moment to look at the plot (and oh what a plot it is) and see how the politics hold up within. Besides, there isn't much to analyze in this one as the writing barely goes beneath the surface. It's basically people got sad they couldn't profit in the specific way they decided they should so they turned the world into a dumb dystopia because their vocation only mattered to them if they could lord it over people. The people the novel praises are those who simply sit back and let the workers make money for them and then call themselves the doers. It's weird and kind of gross.Once upon a time there were some factory owners. These factory ownerslovedto preach about the pride in working for their company, and hey, maybe conditions are piss-poor and maybe you are barely scraping by to feed your growing family, but at least you can take pride in working for a great company and that should satisfy you and give youmeaning(some cool existentialist thought could have been added into the book for that, but Rand misunderstood Kant so I doubt she'd be able to add anything beyond surface detail and pop-philosophy). Then one day the great evil government (the government is such a caricature and it's almost a surprise she didn't have them all wearing black hooded cloaks. And really, who voted for those guys?) passed some outlandish laws that people couldn't have a monopoly and maybe we should pay our workers. Suddenly, having pride in what they did seemedterrible. Instead of taking pride in their company and working hard to sustain the nation they so loved, like they preached to their employees, they bitched about it a bunch and then stopped working. Nice guys, right? They set up a utopia (Ayn Rand of all people should know utopia is a word for 'fake') society where competing isso cooland they say stuff like 'man, I hope someone competes with me and nearly puts me out of business', which isn't all that different from what was going on in the society they fucked off into the woods from in the most comically shameful manner possible. Meanwhile Rand says cheating on your wife is way cool and general chaos ensues.So it goes for awhile, but then, THEN, after a overlong speech that takes all the points any reader with half a mind already put together for themselves and regurgitates it out without the metaphors and into a boring speech that repeats itself many times about the points already mentioned in the novel and then makes sure you know the stuff already mentioned in the novel through a long speech, all hell breaks loose and the main characters bust into town like the goddamn A-Team. Guns blaze, Dagny murders a few dudes and the one character who was actually worth reading about blows up the super-weapon (because that guy was awesome. Screw the rest of the characters, I want to read more about that guy. He was 'about it', like people who are apparently 'about it' say while slugging their Mountain Dews and playing video games.) All integrity of the novel was lost with the hysterically overblown rescue scene. I mean, they even got out on 'choppers' at the end. It was the worst action movie I've ever seen, and I'm not even going to go into the scene where apparently it is okay to shoot your employees in the head for going on strike. And that, my friends, is Atlas Shrugged. People seem to really like the politics, which are \"if things aren't going your way just fuck off into the woods shouting 'and fuck america too.'\" Also she's really into talking about shooting soldiers in the face.Finally. What I really want to talk about is the book as a piece of literature, so don't get all steamed up about politics on me here, pal! Granted, there are a few pretty lines here, particularly the line about cigarettes and how all great thinkers should have that glowing ember at their fingertips while the lightbulb of thought is burning, but other than that Rand is a forgettable sci-fi novelist that has poorly aged with time. Not a line of dialogue rings true to actual speech, not a cough or a scoff can go without her graciously informing the reader that the scoff or cough shows their disapproval or discomfort and whatnot. Furthermore, she certainly can't let a metaphor slip out without explaining it; reading Ayn Rand feels like being a grown adult and sitting in a elementary reading class and having the teacher explain how books work. It's as if she has no faith in her reader as a literate, thinking human being. Worse, the characters are the sort that can only exist on the page and have such narrow-minded two-dimensional aspects that one can't possibly imagine them walking around in the real world. Of course the government is terrible in this novel, its such a caricature that nobody in their right mind would bother being submissive to it. Granted, this book is satire, but come on Rand, put some effort into your creativity.'James, you ought to discover some day that words have an exact meaning.' This idea pops up constantly inAtlas Shrugged, that words have a specific and definite meaning, and the character always wields this like a weapon straight to the heart (Jamesdoessuck as a person and character so I don't feel bad for him for his inability to easily retort. However, Rand seems fully unable to build three-dimensional characters so is it that James is garbage or Rand's novel itself?). This idea is possibly my least favorite aspect of the book because it is comically incorrect. Though maybe my English degree is as useless as it is as finding me a job (totally useless), but from what I've gathered reading books (and Derrida) is that language is anything but exact. Language is pliable, words are an attempt at harnessing the abstract into sound, caging thought into something more tangible. If words have an exact meaning then all the poets have been doing is creating gibberish. And how can Rand go on writing her weak metaphors if she actually believes that statement.Briefly, Ayn Rand separates people into two catagories: those that make, and the 'looters'. Interestingly \"those who make\" spend the whole book only making things hard for the working class who actually make the things they make money off of.Somehow, people still rave about this book. I will say, however, that the chapter where they kill everyone by putting a steam engine through a tunnel was incredibly well done. She could have cut the rest of the novel and simply published that chapter because all the major points are present and for a brief moment the book felt worth reading. I also loved the bits about the pirate and the scene where the government takes over the mines to find them desolated. There are some great 'fight the man' moments but they are buried under a god-awful plot that puts the plot and politics before the writing and told through characters that are so two-dimensional that I can't even believe the scenes that have them walking down a street. There's some politics here I guess some people could get down with if your goal is to be a freshman year edgelord in a poly sci class, and I do understand that this is a response to the horrors of Communist Russia, but she did this so much better in Anthem (though even in that she contradicts herself often. Right after a large discussion on freedom and not letting others think for you, the man names the woman character. He just tells her, this is now your name. Which seems suspiciously not like the freedom the man was fighting for) and others have tackled the issue in a much more agreeable and artistic manner. All sarcasm and jokes aside, I simply do not think this book is well written. I could honestly not care less about the political aspects, its the literary aspects that cause the low rating. I came, I read, I shrugged.1/5Disclaimer: I read this while working in a factory that had no heat or AC and paid minimum wage as the salary cap. However, the office had AC, heat and tons of paid vacation. Perhaps I'm just bitter about the time I was sent home for listening to a DFW interview on Bookworm because it was 'spreading liberal propaganda in the workplace.'Disclaimer #2: 1 star is probably too harsh, but I really wanted to try writing an angry rant review for once. Sorry, I'm most likely the asshole in this situation.There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.- John Rogers"

        "user_review": "In some ways, this is a very bad book. The style is stiff and clunky, and the world-view she is trying to sell you has holes you could drive a train through. There is a nice putdown inOne Fat Englishman. The main character has just been given a precis of Objectivism. He says \"I bet I'm at least as selfish as you. But I don't why I need to turn that into a philosophy\". Thank you, Kingsley Amis.But on the plus side, the book is a page-turner; it does a great job of helping people brought up in a left-wing tradition to understand the right as not just deluded or evil (my friend Gen said she had the same experience after reading it); and it is good at voicing the frustration that competent and honest people feel when they are surrounded by incompetent and dishonest ones. And the romance between Dagny and Hank is emotionally very satisfying. I was so disappointed when she... hm, no spoilers. But I fear the author's desire to push her philosophical agenda got in the way of the story._________________________________________OK, let's try again. I haven't exactly changed my mind on any of the above, but, as Jordan persuasively argues, it's kind of missing the point. And, with all due respect to the other reviews here, most of them are also missing the point.Why? Well, because we're answering the wrong question. Some people uncritically adore this book. Guys, dare I suggest that you might want to broaden your reading tastes just the tiniest amount, and see if you still feel that way? A rather larger group of reviewers can't stand Ayn Rand, and point out various obvious flaws: lack of feeling for English prose style, lack of character development, lack of realistic dialogue, interminable sermons on Objectivism, and sundry other charges. Of course. All of that's clearly true. But here's the question I find more interesting: if the book is so terrible, how come it's been such a gigantic success? It's been said that only the Bible has had a greater influence on 20th century American thought. It must have something going for it. What?So here's my second attempt. I think the book is dishonest, but it's dazzlingly dishonest, on a grand scale, and that's what readers find fascinating. As everyone knows, the basic thesis is that people should be more selfish, and that this will in some mystical way be good for society as a whole; a boldly paradoxical idea, and, at first sight, it's complete nonsense. I can well believe that my selfishness might be good for me personally, but why on Earth should it be good for anyone else? It flies in the face of at least two thousand years of Western ethical thought, which has been largely focused on making peoplelessselfish, not more. As has been widely pointed out, Objectivism is pretty much the antithesis of Christianity. Which does suggest the question of why many people on the American Right claim both to be Christians and at the same time supporters of Rand's ideas, but let's not get into that right now. I don't really understand how the American Right thinks, so it'll be more productive to consider my own reactions to the book, which were by no means all negative.Okay: at risk of appalling many of my GR friends, I have to admit that I liked a good deal ofAtlas Shrugged. In particular, I find Dagny a sympathetic main character. Yes, she's the Mary Sue to end all Mary Sues, but that's exactly it. Rand believes in her so completely that I can't help being swept along. I am aware that few real women are hypercompetent technical and managerial geniuses, who think nothing of working 48 hours straight and then looking drop-dead gorgeous in a designer gown. (If the movie ever does get made, though, you must admit that Angelina Jolie was a shrewd piece of casting). Even if Dagny doesn't exist, I want her to, and I've seen many worse role-models for young women. That mixture of beauty, intelligence and passion is appealing. And sure, most of the other characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, but, when you're as self-centered as Ayn Rand was, that's how you see things. It's a subjective view, and I find it interesting to look at the world through her eyes.Now that I've admitted that I love Dagny - I must admit that I can't decide whether I want to be her or sleep with her; probably a bit of both - let's get on to analyzing Rand's big con. A large part of the book is a lavish, over-the-top, melodramatic romance. Will Dagny get her guy? She's hopelessly in love with Hank, who feels just the same way about her. But Hank's ghastly wife, Lillian, seems to be an insuperable obstacle to their happiness. Hank's got all these mistakenprinciples, see, which mean he has to stay with Lillian, who doesn't appreciate him one bit, rather than go off with his true love. The best scene in the book is the confrontation at the party. Hank has created his new miracle alloy, which is a thousand times stronger than steel and a cool blue-green color to boot. The very first thing he makes from is it a bracelet for Lillian. And is she grateful? Of course not! She's actually going around complaining to the other women about this ugly thing her dumb husband has given her to wear on her wrist. Why couldn't he give her a diamond bracelet like a normal guy? But Dagny, in a blazing fury, goes up to her, and in front of everyone says that she'll be so happy to swap her own diamond bracelet for Hank's unappreciated present. Honestly, if you're not on Dagny's side at this point, I fear you have no heart at all. I was certainly cheering her on, and given the general success of the novel I assume I was one of millions.Rand has stacked the deck, but she's not exactly the first author to do so. The reasonable point she's making here is that, in romantic matters, people should often do what they want to do, rather than than what they feel they ought to do. Straightforwardly selfish behavior is better for everyone; people need love, which makes them happy, rather than pity, which ultimately makes them miserable. At least, it's true in this particular case. You're sitting there willing Hank to understand what's so blatantly obvious. And, once she's got you to buy into her idea, she switches the cards right under your nose. In just the same way, she argues, people shouldalwaysact selfishly! See, if you're given something you haven't truly earned (whatever that means), it won't make you happy. Moreover, the people who are actually entitled to it will feel hurt and frustrated, just like Dagny, and in the end they'll lose their motivation. And thus, um, if you tax multi-billionaires at more than whatever the fashionable rate is, civilization will collapse. QED. I may have condensed the argument a little, but I think that's roughly it.As already mentioned, this is nonsense, and shows that romance authors, even quite good ones, shouldn't try their hand at political philosophy. But that needn't stop you from appreciating their romances, and I certainly did. Next week, I will be reviewing Barbara Cartland's commentaries on Kant. To be continued."

Press 3 if you are so disgusted with this process that you just want to give up.Option 3 is more and more tempting these days…Atlas Shrugged is on many college admission essays that I wonder how often this very review with be plagiarized. Hi, Harvard and Oxford!Before I really get into this 1,000+ page tome, GoodReads, can you do me a favor and give out badges when we read 1,000+ page books?Readings books of this size is like climbing Mount Everest, and it is an event worth celebrating. As an aside, I would also like to see a lifetime pages badge.Anyways…In some respects, Atlas Shrugged is more relevant today than when it was first authored. It speaks to the weariness of overachievers as they go about the world with so many people not doing a good job.Why does it take 45 minutes to buy a single loaf of bread at the store?About two years ago, I ordered a treadmill for under the desk. After meticulously following the instruction manual, the belt would jump forward then slide back. The situation was especially dangerous because there were no handrails. After spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was told that the product was sold by a third-party seller. Up came the chat box where the seller tried to get me to load the 300-pound treadmill into my car, drive it to UPS, haul it in on my bare shoulders, and pay at my expense to ship it back to China. Let's just say that didn't happen…COVID is now the blanket excuse for everything. People now make TikToks about quiet quitting, brazenly describing with pride how they intentionally do a bad job.Withdrawing completely from society is so tempting, hitting Option 3.Another point raised in Atlas Shrugged is how the government, non-businesspeople who don't really understand the situation are making the rules governing business. This really resonated with me but in a slightly different way.Human genome-editing is banned in most countries. In the US, the FDA prohibits DNA-editing.Sorry, you probably fell asleep. What am I talking about?A bunch of scientists at the FDA in their gilded white towers decided that people with life threatening genetic conditions cannot be cured before they are born. It is easy to pass such a sentence onto other people.Have they bothered asking the person who has had two heart surgeries, can't control their left leg, is covered head-to-toe in rashes, takes 14 pills a day, spends 4 hours a week at the hospital, is told by the very same United States government that she can work with restrictions while her heart was stopped, literally dead, treated as a pariah by society with no support, and it all could have been avoided if just one gene, ALDH4A1, was tweaked before she was born? No. No, they haven't.There are so many parallels between gene editing and Rearden Metal.However, Atlas Shrugged is deeply problematic.This book needs to check its premises.Ayn Rand subscribed to a philosophy known as Objectivism and referred to the poor as \"takers\" and \"refuse.\"Only two women are overachievers in Atlas Shrugged: one is a wife of an overachiever and the other is the granddaughter of the company founder.What if Dagny was born poor or of color? What if she had a major illness or accident?How do I really feel about this book? Take my hand. Let's go back in time…..Once upon a time, there was a young but poor scholar who attended a snobby, expensive elite university.The financial aid officer told the scholar that she would have to drop out because her parents could not help with tuition.One day, the scholar took out her sharpened pencils and turned her notebook to a fresh, clean, crisp page, arriving early to her psychology class. Her classmates consisted of the uber-wealthy of America, the types who have summer houses and fathers who work as CEOs of global corporations.As she waited for class to begin, raised voices broke the stillness of the classroom. Two distinct voices engaged in an argument, turning to shouting, and then escalated into threats of violence.\"I'm going to throw this book at you!\"The young scholar leapt to her feet and bolted out of the room, intent on helping, while the rich students were still giving each other awkward stares and shifting uncomfortably in their seats.She quickly located the students in question, determined that they were merely playing, and high-tailed it back to class.As the scholar returned to her seat, her rich classmates turned their attention to her, smothering her with the same question, \"What happened?\"Before the scholar could respond, the psychology professor burst into the classroom, exuberant, an enormous smile crossing her face.\"Lisa is the first person in seven years to respond to this experiment.\"Is there room in these esteemed academic institutions for the virtuous?You say who is John Galt. I say who is Lisa of Troy.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

        "user_review": "The premise: Everyone is stupid except the faith and ideology I want to spread with awkward, bad writing and glorifying sociopathy with a touch of ethical thoughts to make it not look even more inhuman.Imagine the book with a different plot instead of good capitalist vs evil socialist/communist.Let´s sayIntelligent, friendly believers of one faith vs the barbaric, cannibalistic tribe members of a sect.Great, beautiful misogynist vs ugly women.Any kind of wonderful fascism-, eugenic-, master race- driven lunatics vs all other humans.Wise feminists vs bad men.Environmentalists vs evil bureaucracies.Ingenius racists vs the inferior population.The good political party vs the evil political party.Good leftists with pro Nordic model Keynesian strong social state vs evil turbo capitalistic, wait, no, that´s wrong, that doesn´t belong here.Looks quite different, doesn´t it? One understands the sheer stupidity much better in such an ironized context and it shows the immense main problem of misusing fictional literature to implement agenda and bias in a work of fiction to manipulate so many people in real life to think that destructive ideas are great. Just because someone has had bad experiences with one group of people or a regime, as Rand had with marxism and communism, that doesn´t mean, in a simplified and stupid thought, that everything about the opposite is positive and great.Why so many adjectives and extreme contrasts in her writing you may ask? Well, if an author is unable to explain things by showing, not telling, and being an objective and talented storyteller, there have to be many little helpers to make it understandable.It´s impossible to read this without skimming and scanning, there is so much redundancy, info dumping, characters thinking and telling the same stupid premise again and again to themselves and others, and bad writing that it´s truly hard to stay motivated, but it´s a great exercise for learning how not to do it. As there is always said, to enjoy or produce good art, it´s important to consume the worst possible to learn by analyzing the mistakes. But if you aren´t playing around with speed reading techniques for decades, which includes daily training and consciously switching between both speed and intention of reading to understand, learn, or enjoy, it might be a waste of time to read this horrible book. I mean, what about dialogues or interacting with the world instead of endless, boring inner and outer monologues? Looks like some people never get out of pubertal defiant phase.It´s not just one of the most dangerous and destructive books ever written, but a poorly written too. So many people saying that they got influenced by this piece of capitalist propaganda show how the misuse of literature can be instrumentalized to promote an inhuman and disturbing point of view. It gives privileged, mostly white, already rich WEIRDhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...young people the legitimization to feel great about being elitist, bigoted, libertarian egomaniacs that think that being an important part of the mad machinery that destroys the planet is something good, worthwhile, and to be proud of.Not even to talk about people who truly believe that it´s destiny, the product of one´s own work to be proud of, or other demented philosophies in the mix justifying it. I have the extreme luck of being a privileged white person, but I don´t think that I deserve it or use pop psychology, fraud humanities, or even economics to vindicate something that is just the coincidence of birth.In the contrast, I tend to feel ashamed about my first world problems, lack of motivation, procrastination, all these luxury problems, and have a strong attitude towards improving the world by spreading the knowledge about the good, proven, logical, human, alternatives to the stupidity that ruled the earth for millennia. A kind of obligation to be thankful, mindful, positive, and progressive. I don´t get it why educated, intelligent people are still falling victims to ideologies, it must have something to do with a genetic predisposition to believe, no matter how illogical it is.I really said myself that I wanted to objectively understand why people are adoring such a piece of trash like this, if it´s at least an entertaining work of art, but it isn´t even that. It´s the worst of both worlds, a bad fictional pseudo intellectual, fringe science, wanna be philosophical, collection of garbage and something pushing and downplaying turbocapitalism, neoliberalism, neocolonialism, and the destruction of everything needed to build a fair and sustainable economic system and society while giving the perpetrators a pseudophilosophical vindication for doing so. Because they are superior. Extremism is always the same, boring concept, look at all the great historical examples with the same mentality, I live in a country with a history lesson around that you might have heard about.Trash like the Rands´ pseudoscience of objectivismhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objecti...is why I am meanwhile avoiding many humanities that are mainly fairytales built around elements of the replication crisishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...and propaganda.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaga...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_m...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...One of the best, short reviews:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j56I...Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

She also said that I reminded her of the characters....a statement to this day I take pride in....And that is exactly what I learned from this book: that pride is most beautiful thing, and to live on this earth means that one must understand its reality, and learn to use one's mind to make it what one wants it to be. It is about truly loving life and all that it means to 'live' it. It is the reason why I understand myself as a man who belongs on earth....It is very long (almost 1200 pages), so get ready for an epic. I won't try to say it is great literature, though if the style fits the person who is reading it, it will certainly be an amazing read. It can be long-winded and wordy at times, but what philospher isn't? My advice: stick with it through the first half of the first section: it takes it bit to get going in the book, but once it starts, it is worth it....To the proposition that we all have inside of us the inherent values to be heros: we just need to learn the virtues that will bring those values out of us...C.S.

A review many minutes in the writing(and several hours in the photo finding). A review so important that oneDr. Hyperbolehad this to say upon seeing it....This is the review most people didn't even know they wanted to read. A review of one of the most talked about and polarizing classics of the 20th century…ATLAS SHRUGGEDby Ayn Rand.This review will pull no punches as it discusses all aspects of the novel and includes opinions that run the gamut from 5 stars of love to seething cauldron's of 1 star rage...and everything in between. Here is just a sampling of some of the views you can expect to find in the review experts are already calling\"longer and more repetitive than the novel itself\":5 STARS:\"This is a book that proudly celebrates both the individual and the potential for greatness inside all of us. It is a book of new and radical ideas beingpassionatelyexpressed by someone who believes deeply in them. Whether you agree or disagree whole-heartedly or belong somewhere in the middle, it's right and proper to respect the passion and conviction that Ms. Rand feels for her subject.\"---Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, FMR Governor,Imperial Outlands Region in a Galaxy Far, Far Away\"Regardless of how you feel personally about the ideas expressed in this book, it seems clear and not subject to serious debate that the philosophy of objectivism created by Rand added an entirely new voice to the landscape of philosophical, economic and political debate. Call it controversial, call it inflammatory, even call it wrong, but it is impossible to call it irrelevant. There is little question that as a book of ideas, Atlas Shrugged is a monumental book and deserves its place as one of the most important books of the 20th Century...Ain't I right there Normie.\"---Cliff Calvin, Postman, Boston, MA1 STAR:At the far other end of the spectrum are those that thought Atlas Shrugged was 1200 pages of mind-numbing, bowel churning, elitist tripe. Among these detractors was oneP. Griffinfrom Quohog, RI, who had this to say:Unfortunately, when pressed for specifics or examples to support his opinion, Mr Griffin screamed and ran away to hideAlso not a fan was oneJules Winnfield, an independent contractor from, according to him, \"The Valley of Death\" who had real problems with Rand's prose which he found clunky and very unpolished. He summed up his opinion about Rand's writing ability as follows:4 STARS:Back on the positive side, you will hear from more people who found Rand's magnus opus to be powerful and something definitely worth reading......\"Ayn Rand was born in Russia and grew up witnessing first hand the failings of collectivism as well as many of its more brutal aspects enforced in the former U.S.S.R. Therefore, her passionate embrace of the \"free market\" and capitalism and the idea of rewarding the individual for excellence is certainly understandable in light of her origins. It is also true that Rand's depiction of a dystopian future in which individual achievement and have been replaced by collectivism and distribution according to need has more than just passing relevance today. Whether or not you believe her vision is skewed or biased, there is still much that her book can add to the debate on the proper role of government in the life of the individual.\"---Gabe Kotter, School teacher, James Buchanan High School, Brooklyn, NY\"In my opinion, the MOST IMPORTANT lesson that can be taken from Atlas Shrugged is the concept that Rich, successful people are not evil simply because they are wealthy and are certainly not the enemy of the poor or the disadvantaged. There are GOOD and BAD in every economic layer in society and this bias just seems extremely destructive.***I know that wealthy people are an easy target for humor but when people actually believe that being wealthy makes someone \"less moral\" or \"less good\" it starts to sound eerily similar to when people used to say about other groups \"There just not like us, there different.\" Sorry, I can't buy into that. People are people and everyone is entitled to being judged for who they are.\"---Mr. Hankey(aka The Christmas Poo)\"Every person that ever gave me a job, an opportunity or the means to feed myself and provide for my family was WEALTHY by most peoples standards. Walk around your house and pick up the products that you use every day and that make your life easier and ask yourself how many of them were made by people who made a lot of money off them (my guess is most of them). The world we be a lot worse off without the inventors, the builders and the risk takers and they deserve our thanks and not our animosity....Nanu Nanu\"---Mork, Ambassador from the Planet of Ork2 STARS:Of course, the negative reviews don't stop with the 1 star commentators. There were additional negative reactions raised about Atlas Shrugged and this review promises to tackle them in depth. One very controversial subject deals with attacks on Ayn Rands views on sexuality which are certainly on display in the novel. Comments about the sexual relationships described in the story being \"odd\" or \"freaky\" are not uncommon and some go so far as to accuse Rand of having a \"rape fantasy fetish.\"A. Powersfrom Great Britain, who was unable to divulge his exact occupation actually attacked Rand personally with this very blunt reaction to Atlas Shrugged's sexual content.A second, less controversial view but one that is probably far more relevant to a true analysis of this work is Rand's consistent use of blatant and obvious \"straw men\" to support her argument. Many people have argued that for someone so passionate about her beliefs who is absolutely convinced of the rightness of her convictions, she sure felt the need to stock the book with a lot of easily dispatched \"straw man\" characters.AsI Aminfrom Uganda put it: \"This was probably my biggest problem with the book. If [Rand] is so sure that her arguments are valid and correct, then why doesn't she have the Rand characters (i.e., those espousing her opinions) debate against thebestarguments that the 'other side' has to offer. Instead she has peopled her expository novel with 'over the top' caricatures of the socialist system so that they can easily tear them down. This does nothing but preach to the converted and has all the persuasive power of a political attack ad.\"Or, put another way, \"I think there is a compelling debate in there somewhere. Unfortunately, Rand, Dum Dum that she is, decided to load the other side's quiver with nothing but wet noodles and so comes off looking scared of a true debate.\"--Gazoo, Intergalactic Talking HeadAnother cause of very negative reactions stems from the incredible amount of repetition and redundancy used by Rand in the stating of her opinions. State your opinion once and that is laudable. If it is overly complex, maybe you repeat it a second, even a third time. However, in a 1200 page novel when you have to listen to the EXACT SAME POINT made 10, 20 or even 30 times, you can cause your audience to become very irate and disenchanted. One disgruntled reader stopped reading the novel halfway through and said simply........3 STARSFinally, you will here from those who found both positive and negative qualities in Rand's novel. Many found the prose less than noteworthy but were very taken by the plot. Others liked the characters but had issues with the world-building (or lack thereof) in Rand's tale. Still others liked the passion of Rand's convictions but found her message lost in a myriad of meandering speeches....All of these issues and much more will be tackled in this comprehensive, detailed review of Rand's controversial classic. While not to be released until mid-summer 2012, early buzz is already calling this review\"A review of Atlas Shrugged.\"We only hope we can live up to those expectations. Until then........."

        "user_review": "\"Check your premises\" the major characters are told. Well let's check the premises of Ms. Rand's story.The first (false) premise is that there are only a dozen or so people in the country who are worth a damn. They have well above-average intelligence, have worked hard and have been lucky enough that their work has paid off in oodles of money (which they don't enjoy or even care about because they are too busy working). But they can't bear the thought of paying taxes to support the services they receive and depend upon.The second (false) premise is that every government employee is a lazy no-good who has nothing on his mind but pillaging the bank accounts of the lucky dozen. But beyond that, the government is inherently evil, to the point of passing laws that inflict major economic damage and suffering on virtually everyone in the country with the exception of the privileged government leaders. This evil government is all-powerful and has total control over every newspaper, television and radio station. Fat chance. Obviously the author's image of government derives from her formative years in the USSR. She has no concept that other governments have not tolerated the oppression that she found there.The third (false) premise is that the rest of the people of the U.S. are mostly a bunch of lazy morons who blindly accept the statements of the evil government and their patsy press. Further, they have no ability or process to provoke change. They wander around like a bunch of sheep being led to the slaughter. If only they were weren't so stupid and lazy they would all be as rich as the \"lucky dozen elite\". Since they didn't have the ability (or intensity or luck) to become one of the elite, they all think that the elite should support them so they don't have to work. The country has a middle class composed of about 24 people who are the trusted, loyal assistants of the elite. They are good enough to do everything their masters ask, but not good enough to join their masters in \"Atlantis\". When the elite disappear (on strike), their trusted assistants are left behind to bear the misfortune of the rest of the poor slobs.This is all set on a stage of poor science fiction, which includes such things as a magic \"motor\" generating vast amounts of energy out of nothing. The author doesn't seem to know the difference between a motor and a generator and uses the terms interchangeably. Then there is a magic \"ray\" that makes large areas of land invisible, powered, of course, by the magic \"motor\". These magic things were, of course, invented by the intelligent elite who use them to help wreak havoc and despair on the rest of the 200 million people of the country in order to punish the evil government.Then there's the (obligatory) sex. Dagny Taggart, the heroine and only intelligent woman in the universe, has sex with three of the elite. She dumps the only real relationship (with Rearden) in favor of the demi-god John Galt (who she barely knows) along the lines of a teenage girl throwing herself at one of the Beatles. Her favorite encounters are sado-masochistic.In the end, after they have succeeded in destroying the economy of the world and most everyone's life, the elite magnanimously plan to sashay back into the real world and rebuild the hundred years of technology that they just destroyed. Isn't that a brilliant idea? They think the only path to change is to take their football and go home. You have to wonder how brilliant these people really are.The author spends great quantities of print describing and re-describing thoughts and feelings of the characters ad nauseum. The redundancy is overwhelming.This poor attempt at science fiction with a supposed moral message demonstrates how a 350 page book can be padded to become a 1200 page behemoth. Elitists, libertarians and others paranoid about the government will undoubtedly enjoy this book. Paramilitary groups will love it. Most of the rest of us will ask ourselves \"What the hell was she was thinking?\""

        "user_review": "I read this book as a teenager while recovering from a long bout of viral fever which had left me bedridden for almost a month: I had exhausted all my other books and forced to rummage through old shelves in my house. (Ironically, I readThe Grapes of Wrathalso at the same time.) My teenage mind was captivated by the \"dangerous\" ideas proposed by Ayn Rand. At that time, India was having an inefficient \"mixed\" economy comprising all the negative aspects of capitalism and socialism, and Ms. Rand seemed to point a way out of the quagmire.Almost thirty years hence, I find the novel (if it can be called that - Ayn Rand's idea of fiction is a bunch of pasteboard characters put there as her mouthpieces) to be silly beyond imagination. The premise is laughable; the characters entirely forgettable; and the writing, abyssmal. The idea that governments governing the least and allowing a \"winner-take-all\" economy to flourish will solve all the world's woes (\"Social Darwinism\", a word I've heard used to describe her philosophy) will not wash anywhere today, I would wager - even with the hard-core adherents of the GOP in the USA. Especially when we look at Europe, where capitalism has gone into a downward spiral.Ms. Rand, sorry to say, Atlas didn't shrug:Atlas collapsed!"

        "user_review": "The Concept: Rand follows the lives of society's movers and shakers (first-handers, in her words, and business men, scientists, inventors, and artists in her novel) as they resist the societal pull to become second-handers and to remain true to themselves and their live's work. Meanwhile, something is happening that is shaking the very foundation of society.After readingThe FountainheadandAtlas Shruggedby Ayn Rand in 2005-2006, my life has been changed for the better. Applying Rand's ideas to my own life has made my mind clearer and has helped me to acchieve goals I thought were unreachable. Rand's ideas have been a big part of \"growing up\" and getting through the \"quarter life crisis\" for me.While I read Rand's books for her ideas and to better understand the application of her philosophy, they can also be read on many different levels. Through reading them, not only did I read an amazing story, carefully crafted and well rendered, but I also learned so much. However, one does not have to delve deep into Rand's philosophical background to enjoyThe FountainheadorAtlas Shrugged-- they are also great stories about human endurance, individualism, freedom, relationships, and integrity.If you are reading this book to gain an understanding of Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, then I would recommend reading this book AFTER reading Ayn Rand's other famous fiction,The Fountainhead.The Fountainheadis a more straight forward place to start that study.I highly recommend this book, and I have a copy to loan if you're interested. When you're reading, we can go out for coffee to talk about the book -- there is much to think about in this one."

It spars only with Dianetics and in its absolute absurdity.The characters are absolutely idealized 'heroes of capitalism' action figures. I wonder if Rand imagined some of these great barons of industry coming to her rescue when she immigrated away from the vile pit of communism that she left behind. You know, during the time where she forged her citizenship papers and depended on the generocity and kindness of a liberal, open society.If only she had us all her irritating, long winded, repetative tales of woe for the monied class of brilliantly handsome, powerful super geniuses.She bases all of this on her objectivist claptrap, claiming rationality as her own private high ground. But this is a general critique of her works. Specifically this book is completely overwritten and serves as flak cover for all the wrong people. The Jack Welch's and Phil Knights that imagine themselves to be the heroes of this book.This book has done more to create a generation of self interested greedy mindless zombies than any other book I can think of."

        "user_review": "I didn't know what to expect from this book when I started reading, but it is fair to say that I wouldn't have guessed it would prove to be anything like it ended up. This is pure and simple melodrama starring various iterations of Nietzschean Supermen wrapped up tight in Hayek's Road to Serfdom – so, essentially, this is three of my least favourite things all slammed together in one endlessly, endlessly long book. In fact, if you were to read The Road to Serfdom and to say at the end of each chapter, \"oh, yes, yes, take me, take me in your strong arms, no, no, don't ask, just take me, take me here, here on my desk, here, oh yes, yes, let my body sing against your unbridled and determined will, please, please, let me submit to your manly desire, oh, yes, god, oh, yes, yes, yes.\" You would pretty much have the novel down pat and would have saved yourself a week or so of reading.About a year ago I read a book, written in the 1880s, called 'The Melbourne Riots'. It was written by a kind of agrarian Socialist, I guess. In the book he shows how grossly unfair the current social situation is and proposes a utopian village where people will be able to live in a kind of commune, where each person will contribute to the common labour of the village, and will be rewarded according to the work that they do. I thought as I was reading it that it was interesting how these sorts of novels really had had their time at the end of the 19th century – with their Owen-like visions of brave new worlds. Do people write novels about socialist utopias now? Do people still go off to Paraguay to set up communes?Well, this book is a right wing version of these utopian communes. It is a vision where the great and best among us go on strike and leave the rest of us to our misery – leaving us as Nietzsche's botched and bungled – for us to fend for ourselves, catastrophically for ourselves, until we realise the error of our ways and beg for the thinkers, the men of action to return to once again have their way with us.In this sense the novel is also a reworking of Aristophanes' Lysistrata – where the women of Greece go on a strike denying men sex until they end the Peloponnesian War. It is just in this case it is the businessmen and the great scientists who go on strike until they are allowed to finally be rewarded according to the true worth of their contribute to society. This is a book of inversions and strawmen.The main strawman is a caricature of Marx, particularly his 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'. This is repeated throughout the novel, maybe 20 times, you are certainly not meant to have missed it – but it is always used as an excuse by those with a death mentality so as to excuse the fact that they live from the appropriated productivity, brilliance and wisdom of the supermen industrialists. The fact that Marx believed work was the highest human virtue, that he said those who do not work should not eat, that his conception of morality was that people create the world through their labour and that this is the sole source of all value, moral and physical, in the world – none of this is mentioned in the strawman that is built. And Marx is not the only strawmen. The only Christians that could feel comfortable reading this book would be that particularly US version, the Prosperity Christian.In the world of this book, humanity is divided into two distinct groups. One group is the great mass of us, and we are mostly parasites. We are, and will always remain, Nietzsche's sheep. We are good at following orders, but only because we refuse to think for ourselves. When confronted by a new or novel problem that is not contained within a standard protocol we have learnt or can refer to, we are immediately crushed and incapable of any form of action and particularly not risk taking. This is what divides us from our betters, the Supermen. They would rather act than be delayed for a moment in their grand desire to transform the world in their own image. They are the great artists – the world is their canvas – the will to power is the creative gesture that they deploy and make the rest of us gape upon in wonderment. Where a challenge stops the rest of us in our tracks, risk is but another obstacle on the path to their foretold greatness.And this world would be fine, except that we cannot be contented with allowing these gods among us to exercise their greatness. No, instead we have created life draining moral precepts to keep these gods in their place and to force them to dedicate their lives to meeting our needs and our wants at their expense. This is all straight Nietzsche, of course.It is hard to know if you are meant to read this novel as a work of political philosophy or as a kind of cheap novel. As a novel it is breathless soap opera. \"Oh, alack, it would have been impossible for me to finish building my railroad if I had 9 months, but now, now I have only 6 to do it in – I will just have to dedicate myself to this greatest of achievements and focus my will…\" You might think I'm exaggerating – but read 20 pages of this and you see, in fact, I've toned it down.At the start it becomes fairly clear that many of the Supermen are what we would today call 'on the spectrum'. They are socially inept, trapped in loveless marriages and with families who do not understand them, or even try to understand them. They are unable to understand why they are expected to meet various obligations that they are otherwise completely uninterested in. But if the main characters are incapable of empathy, this reflects the lack of empathy the author struggles with for anyone that is not one of her supermen. The only slightly three-dimensional characters in the book are these supermen – everyone else is a two-dimensional cartoon character who are only in the book for what they represent – which is invariably an obstacle placed in the way of the Supermen to help them learn both their own true nature and the true nature of the society they need to tear down and rebuild anew.I don't want to spoil this for you, well, any more than I already have, but I do need to say that towards the end of this the main Superman gives a radio speech to the world. He says later, in a conversation about the speech that it went for three hours – it certainly felt like it as I was reading it. An endless harangue, putting all of us in our place, explaining morality, economic theory, the author's great men of history theory, and so much else, felt like it was never going to end. I kept thinking, can she really believe this would convince anyone? I mean, beyond the total lack of verisimilitude in such a long speech, I kept hearing the audience of the supposed radio program saying, 'can't you turn this shit off?' In no sense could this be called 'show, don't tell'. In fact, the whole book is a kind of exercise in tell, don't show. There are no debates in this book – there is no discussion. There is the truth and lies – and each speaks past the other. This is a book of certainty.I need to come back to sex. Each of the Supermen want to have sex with the sole Superwoman in the book, our main character in the novel. And each does have sex with her. But the sex is always initiated by the men while she submits, a passive receptacle of his desire and his lust. Look, I know it was written in the 1950s, but for someone calling for the revaluation of all values, this passive female sexuality clearly wasn't one of the values she had in mind as needing re-evaluation. There is even a scene where the female lead is lying in a bed, in the room next to the man she wants to screw next, but although she is nearly driven insane by desire, she remains lying on her bed, her hands pressed deep into the mattress to stop herself rushing to the object of her desire, struggling to contain her overwhelming passion. The purple prose in this book is, I have to say, nothing if not amusing.As someone who doesn't agree with the ideology pushed here, I was always going to struggle with this book. But I was curious to see what a novel written by someone pushing these ideas might look like. And now I know. The best of ideological fiction generally contains characters that are complex and interesting – there's not a single character here that is truly interesting. The good guys are superheroes – flying planes into impossible landings, sticking it to the man, fixing the unfixable, knowing when to take risks and for those risks always to pay off. The bad guys are infinitely bad, and invariably reduced to silence by the least word from one of these Supermen. Still, the melodrama is turned up to eleven here, and the whole way through, every damn page. In fact, I kept wondering how there could still be so much left in this book when crisis after crisis seemed to imply we would need to be nearly at the end, surely, nearly at the end now.This is a capitalist utopia of aggressive selfishness – who could have guessed that could become the basis of an entire, very, very long novel?"

        "user_review": "Atlas Shrugged is a flawed epic, strident with a swaggering ambition, yet almost fable-like in its overly simplistic social and economic criticisms.This is more of a philosophical, social commentary than a literary monument. The characterization is where it fails; Rand draws stick figures for antagonists: caricatures, strawmen to act as foil to her politico-economic-social vehicle. This is the book that made everyone mad in the late fifties: progressive liberals were spurned due to its vitriolic anti-government stance and conservatives stayed away in droves due to Rand's over the top atheism.As provocative and controversial as it is, I wondered at the society that had produced Rand and marveled at the influence she had on our culture since its publication. I have read many controversial books, and have wondered how many critics have actually read the work; Atlas Shrugged makes me wonder how many fans have actually read it.Rand would no doubt be critical of big business today with its corporate dollar laden cushions and aristocratically removed \"leadership\". Rand's libertarianism shares with Sinclair's socialism in that it looks good in print.The length? Yep, it's a 1300 plus page monster. Rand forces her readers to be submerged, to live in the dystopian wasteland for two or three months to fully comprehend her vision.Finally I am left with a feeling, an assurance, that I do not like Ms. Rand and don't care for her arrogance and her casual dismissal of much of what is good in society.*** 2021 - thought about this and have decided that even if I don't care for Rand, disagree with much of her ideas, I did like parts of this book"

Now.):Shouldn't it be \"If you want to know with whom the female protagonist has deep and meaningless sex\"? Anyway, read the book.Get Your Copy Free or Pay for It and Get a 200% Tax DeductionPeopled by larger-than-life heroes and villains, charged with larger than life accoutrements, struggling with towering questions of good and evil, and an adolescent's curiosity and enthusiasm for sex, \"Shagged At Last\" is a philosophical revolution told in the form of a soft-focus, hard-core action thriller with conveniently positioned tax-deductible PowerPoint slides explaining Objectivism from an historical point of view and revealing the correct use of all body parts from an hysterical point of view.Disclaimer:The televisualisation of the hysterical perspective is currently subject to the formalisation of contractual relations with Manny and Jessica Rabbit.Ayn Rand Plays Lady MacbethYou won't find in meThe milk of human kindness,Just dire cruelty.Only Her Self to BlameRand's philosophyFucked a whole generationWith its selfishness.Turn Me On and Turn Me OffYour fans are turned onBy Sex ObjectivismBut it turns me off."

        "user_review": "After working on this book for several months, I finally finished it and loved it. I've learned that I rate a book highly when it forces me to think and broadens my perspective. Rand definitely accomplishes this in Atlas Shrugged and earns five stars. I am amazed at the depth of her philosophy, her intelligence, and her ability to write and communicate her ideas through strong, entertaining fictional characters.In Atlas Shrugged, she shares her philosophy which she calls Objectivism, which in a word is a system of justice. Before reading this book, I always viewed justice as cold, distant, and inferior to mercy, but Rand helps me view the essentiality and virtues of justice. In a few other words, Rand is an advocate of reason, logic, accountability, production, capitalism, agency, human ability, and she believes that working for one's happiness is essential and each person's personal responsilibity. She is against pity, mediocrity, taxation, seizing wealth and production from those who produce to redistribute to those who are unwilling to work hard. In the story, she illustrates what would happen to the world if incentive to produce is removed from the intelligent and able - the motor of the world would stop.I love how Rand's character Dagny Taggart is such an example of intelligence and ability. She will move heaven and earth to accomplish her purposes and she approaches life with such passion. She runs the leading transcontinental railroad in the country, and Rand created this character in the 1950's!Despite my love of the book, there were a few drawbacks for me. Rand believes that one's professional work, what he is able to produce, is THE purpose of life, definitely a \"live to work\" approach. Also, I didn't find any thread of mercy in her philosophy, which makes me wonder her view on caring for those who cannot care for themselves. Rand also has a sexual theme that emerges several times in the book which I didn't know I was in for when I began the book. Be forewarned that it's there, and she has a strong theory on sexuality that you'll be exposed to in reading the book.Reading Atlas Shrugged reminded and empowered me to work hard for what I want in life, to stop making excuses, and to hold myself accountable and responsible for what I do or don't acoomplish."

        "user_review": "A Modest ProposalI'd give this book 10 stars, but it only gets five, because really, Ayn didn't have the courage of her convictions. She wussed out at the end and gave in to EVIL Liberal Blackmail. The problem withAtlas Shruggedis that it doesn't go far enough. And so, to correct that, here's an addendum, a modest proposal to supplement Ayn's book.We're taxing the wrong people. Why are we taxing rich people more than poor people? Rich people don't need government services. If they want a highway, they'll build it themselves. If they need electricity, they'll build a god damn dam. It'spoorpeople that need the government to build these things for them. So, the tax structure should work this way:-- Everyone in the bottom half of income earners pays 50% tax.-- Those in the top sixth decile pay 40%.-- Those in the top seventh decile pay 30%.-- Those in the top eighth decile pay 20%.-- Those in the top ninth decile pay 10%.-- And those in the top tenth decile pay nothing.This will encourage those lazy bums at the bottom to slave for rich people. After all, it's by slaving away and working hard for them that they can eventually become rich too. It's coddling them otherwise.Why this tax structure? It's logical isn't it? It's RICH PEOPLE that create jobs. Ergo, the more money they have, the more jobs they will create. They are the Job Creators! We DEPEND on them for the jobs. Instead of taxing them we should be eternally thankful to them for even Existing.But even this, EVEN THIS, fails to FULLY recognise how brilliant and innovative and hard working Rich People are. Without them, we'd all be living in mud huts and eating each other to stay alive. Clearly, it's NOT enough to NOT tax them. No, if they are in the top 5% of income earners, we should PAY THEM to stay in our country. Why, just their very presence in a country will mean that its inhabitants will get rich. It's that Well-Documented, Scientifically Proven Trickle-Down Effect.How much should we pay? Obviously, the answer is to let the Market decide: governments should bid against each other in an open auction. Highest bidder wins. And clearly this has to be done as often as the Rich People want to change their country of residence. After all, you can't expect them to just stay in one country all their life. That would be a Fetter on Market Forces! (--booooooo!--)Countries should COMPETE to attract rich people to their shores. Cypress giving them grief? Why the UK will PAY them GBP1 million to come over. Hell, don't go to the UK! We'll pay GBP1 trillion AND sweeten it with a line of grateful poor people lying down at the landing strip for them to walk over so that they don't soil their gold Gucci shoes on our unworthy soil.And for those at the top 1%? Well, nothing's too good for them. No point offering them money since they make more than what any country can offer anyway. No, for them, we'll offer money AND a line of poor people AND control of the government. See a law they don't like? Governments will change it for them. See laws that need to be put in place? Governments had damn well vote them in if they know what's good for them.Oh, and that nonsense about power corrupting doesn't apply to Rich Job Creators. THEY are subject to the Discipline of the Market. That Invisible Hand will come down and smack them upside down if they try anything funny. We don't need governments. Governments are for those rotten horrible poor people. The Invisible Hand keeps Rich Job Creators honest, hardworking, and competitive. They wouldn't dream of selling fraudulent financial instruments, or food that poisons you, or buildings that collapse, or lie about the value of their companies. Nobody would buy their products if they did that you see. It's only when Big Brother Governments intervene that such things happen. It's only when Big Brother Governments that think they know better and force them to obey laws (--booooooo!--) that faulty, dangerous bridges or aircraft get built, or carcinogens get dumped into rivers.All hail Rich People! Without Them, life would be just shit. Civilisation Would Not Exist! Amen!Update (20 Jan 2014)You think this review is just kidding around? Fact is, we already live in anAtlas Shruggedworld: In a world of 7 billion and more,85 people (0.000001% of the world's population) own more than 50% of the rest. Think about it, if YOU became that rich and that powerful, once you got there, why WOULDN'T you do everything you could to make sure the rest would stay there and not pose a threat to your wealth? Why WOULD you let the system that allowed you to get to the top allow someone else to dethrone you? Ayn Rand would be SO proud."

        "user_review": "Based on everything I've heard about Rand, in conversation and online, from her supporters and her detractors, or in interviews with the author or articles by her, I feel there is no reason to believe that this book or any of her others contain anything that is worth reading, not even as 'cautionary example'. Nothing about it sounds the least bit appealing or reasoned.Watching interviews of Rand, herself, I wonder if she wasn't somewhere on the autism spectrum--her entire Objectivist philosophy seems like the sort of approach autistic people have to develop to deal with a world full of emotions, sympathies, and signals they cannot recognize or comprehend. The fact that this philosophy has since been picked up by Silicon Valley culture, itself notorious for high levels of autism, seems logically to follow.Likewise, it would have an appeal for certain types of sociopaths, who also do not feel strong sympathy or emotional connection. Objectivism can thus be seen as a kind of justification for the lives they choose to leave: isolating themselves, putting work and financial achievement above social life, using others to get ahead, then blaming them for being emotionally open, and hence susceptible to manipulation.It's unfortunate that Rand's method focuses on brutalizing, blaming, and denying people who are unlike her, instead of working with them and trying to understand them--recognizing and cherishing those differences, the fact that a society requires many different types of people to run effectively.But then, looking at her life, and her inner circle--the isolation, disappointment, depression, and awkward love affairs as depicted in something like Adam Curtis' DocumentaryAll Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, one sees a Rand who is wounded, alienated, and fragile--a far cry from the philosophy of power and dominance she wrapped around herself like armor--so of course she would lash out at the world and blame it.There is also a curious parallel between her representation of the world and the moral certitude and will to power of modern fantasy novels. She seems to engage in the same sort of 'worldbuilding', where characters and events are structured to uplift a certain philosophy of life, where the story is abandoned for long passages to explain in minute detail the finer points of the constructed world.As such, it's not surprising that she attracts a similar fanbase with her doorstop novels: a group of privileged middle class white folks who feel disaffected and are looking for a mythology structured around them and their struggles, which justifies their biases, privilege, and preferred way of life.So, as nothing about any of her works has ever sounded appealing or interesting to me, and since my goal here is to read as many good books as possible and to do my best to avoid bad ones, it seems best to give Rand a wide berth."

I wasn't, and still am not, a political reader and such messages have to be particularly heavy handed to be noticed, even more so to distract me from the story.As a scientist I had a natural sympathy for our hero who appeared to be standing up for intellect, reason, and clear thinking against a sea of red tape, vested interests, and resistance to change. However, even with the powerful following wind of being in the protagonist's head and seeing everything through their lens, the point of view pushed by the narrative did grow less and less palatable. The bias grew so thick as to stray into parody. Everyone in our hero's way was a useless moocher seeking to rob the earnings he had made with his own two hands. Everyone who disagreed with him was a lentil-farming hippy or a self-absorbed oxygen sink who refused all opportunity to help themselves.I recall that the story remained mildly interesting and I did make it to the end. I had a libertarian friend who, some years later, became teary eyed when describing the John Galt speech as the best piece of literature in the history of writing... I didn't admit to him that I had grown so bored with that part that I skipped to the end of it.It's a long book, and the story (as far as I recall it) is far from terrible. However, the thickly applied lectures on libertarian philosophy - which felt to me deeply selfish, amoral, and as empty as they are shallow - all while describing everyone else as selfish, greedy thieves ... grated on this usually oblivious reader to a point where the potential enjoyment was heavily eroded.Join my PatreonJoin my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes."

It was themust readbook of the day among my group of quasi-whatever we were (not intellectuals of any persuasion I might add) and I struggled through it to the bitter end, telling anyone who would listen that it was the most important book of the century. Yeah, like I would know this at the tender age of 20?!What it was, was BIG - 1100 and something pages - and while I was quite adept at posing with book in hand and able to quote some John Galt verbatim, I really understood absolutely nothing about the incredibly selfish philosophy of Objectivism. This book ofessential readingwas as dry as a dead dingo's donger and just as interesting. In later years, as I read and studied more, I came to realise just what Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Brand were on about and Atlas Shrugged became a personal memento of the shallow crassness of me and my youthful peers in the late fifties and early sixties.20/01/2021 Addendum:I am indebted to GR stalwart, Michael Perkins, for this quote which I copied from his review of Atlas Shrugged:\"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.\" – John Rogers28/09/2021 Addendum:And thank you, Michael, for alerting me to this great comment about Atlas Shrugged:\"I have always found it quaint and rather touching that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough.\" - Christopher Hitchens"

        "user_review": "Who is John Galt? Actually, I think he may be alive and well, and residing in the US Senate this very minute. I hate to accuse anyone directly, but I think he may even be from my own state. Metaphorically speaking of course, because he has many imitators around the world. When I read a book I usually try to seperate the writers personal views and opinions from the novel and read it for what it is, a work of fiction. That's hard to do with Ayn Rand, especially this book, because she hammers you with them in every paragraph. (\"Socialists are weak and evil, capitalists are strong and good. The 99 percenters are trying to feed off the genius and success of the 1 percenters\"). I didn't like the agenda put forth in this book, but I gave it 4 stars because when it comes to putting pen to paper, Ayn Rand could write. She just didn't write what I want to hear. I also gave it 4 stars because it's important for us to pay attention. This book has had, and still does have, a huge influence on millions of people. When Modern Library selected their 100 best novels of the 20th century Atlas Shrugged wasn't on the list, but they also allowed readers to vote and select their favorite novel. Atlas Shrugged was number one. That might have given us a little hint why someone like Trump could be elected president. As I did in my review of The Fountainhead, I will quote Pogo; \"I have seen the enemy, and he is us\"."

Now that I teach it in my AP English class, I've reread it many times, and I'm more convinced than ever that if you are only going to read one book in your life, it should be this one. The unnamed protagonist re-enacts the diaspora of African-Americans from the South to the North--and the surreal experience of racism, rage, and manipulation rarely expressed with such force and eloquence. Ellison follows tried and true patterns from dramatic ritual to spell out his invisible man's journey from cocksure teenager to furious refugee hiding out in a basement in Harlem. The last lines of the book are haunting and almost hopeful through the despair."

I am invisible because people refuse to see me…When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination- indeed, everything and anything except me.\"When I first read the book last year, the above quote really stood out to me. It seemed very Dostevskyan. It has taken a second reading for me to truly process the content of this book, and still I can't exactly say I understand all the symbolism.I really enjoy coming of age books and this one is no exception. The book starts off with the narrator attending a college in the American South. Due to some events I won't get into he moves to Harlem to look for work. We see the maturing process of the narrator as he goes from being an innocent boy to one who begins to question his identity but can't seem to reconcile it with his role as a black man in (racist) 1950s America. And like any coming-of-age story, there is a lot of interior and external conflict.It's hard to really summarize this book because so much goes on. Of course the main issue is about race and how it was for a person of colour living in a racist society at the time. The book also gets political when it outlines different possible approaches for racial integration, one more radical than the other.All in all a great book, a book which I will probably have to read again (or discuss it with someone!) to understand it better."

        "user_review": "Invisible Manis an extremely well written and intelligent novel full of passion, fire and energy: it's such a force to be reckoned with in the literary world, and not one to be taken lightly.\"I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves or figments of their imagination, indeed, everything and anything except me.\"The biggest question the novel raises evolves around identity (or lack thereof) in a world that demands we conform and meet the expectations of others. The unnamed protagonist becomes invisible, well he feels invisible, because the world cannot accept his opinions, desires and intellectual freedom: he must think, act and talk in a way he is told; thus, his personality vanishes as he becomes what he must.He cannot form his own identity because every time he creates a sense of individualism he is knocked back because his expression of self does no adhere to someone's wishes. And this lack of self prevents him from finding any sense of belonging because wherever he goes he is not himself. And this isn't just about blackness in the face of a white society. This isn't just about the postcolonial state of slavery and hybrid identity in the face of a supposed freedom from the shackles that bound the blacks to their masters; this is about American society at large: it's about the world at large.\"When I discover who I am, I'll be free.\"And that's what makes the novel so powerfully emotive and raw. The narrator enters many different communities and societies, each of which impose an idea upon him about the way in which blacks should behave. Some argue for perpetuating the stereotypical uneducated negro, some suggest that the blacks should be violent and reclaim there lost African heritage and others suggest for science and rationality in dictating the future of blacks in America. In each instance the narrator finds himself detached and separate; he plays an inauthentic role in trying to adhere to ideas about himself that he does not feel are right.So as he walks through the world lost and confused, dazed and downtrodden, he tries to find himself and fails miserably. The language Ellison tells the story through is remarkable and perceptive; he has a ridiculously keen ear for dialogue and speech patterns that allow the narrator to express himself in way that demonstrates his disillusionment with the world. He is not a happy man, and this is not a happy book. It bespeaks the blindness of society, ideology and those that profess to act in our best interests.\"Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat.\"As I write these words, I'm about to begin my second read of this spectacular novel. There's just so much in here that one read is simply not enough."

What an incredible bonus to be able to follow in the footsteps of the young man struggling with racial and political identity questions. The physical presence of New York life enhanced the reading, and the city added flavour and sound to the story. Hearing the noise, walking in the lights of the advertisements, seeing the faces from all corners of the world made the main character's confusion and freedom of identity choice evident. And being a stranger in New York myself, I turned into an invisible woman, taking in the atmosphere without being noticed.Following the successes and misfortunes of the narrator, this novel shapes the identity of the reader as well. You can't escape the big questions built into the story.What is reality? What is scientifically true? How do we approach our given environment? Are words more powerful than actions or vice versa? Is there a logical chain of causes and effects between verbal instigation and violent action? Is there objective justice? How do we define it?The answers are not straight forward, but the narrator encourages the reader to try to embrace and understand the various changing shapes human beings take on over the course of their lives. It is better to live your own absurd life fully than to die for the absurdity of others' ideas:\"I was pulled this way and that for longer than I can remember. And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone's way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man.\"Must-read!Favourite quote:\"Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat.\"Postscript: Rereading this review in March 2017, after following the rapid change in America since last summer, I am filled with sadness that we can never take for granted that we have left a certain kind of populism and racist propaganda behind, and that human rights can still be treated with farcical disrespect. I won't return to New York for the time being. The novel, however, is more recommended than ever."

        "user_review": "Invisible Man is unique.I went in without really having any expectations other than knowing that it was a classic novel addressing the trials and tribulations faced by the black community in the mid-1900s. While it is that, the experience of the tragic hero of the novel is very bizarre, trippy, and somewhat unexpected. It is told in a way to make sure it reflects on a variety of possible experiences a black man might face during the time period. But, because Ellison is covering so many in one book and they are delivered in such quick succession, your head might be spinning before it is done.I was surprised at how accessible the writing is. Sometimes I am nervous going into a classic worried that I will be spending more time getting comfortable with the writing style than actually absorbing the story. With Invisible Man, the writing and narrative are very easy to follow, and it only requires a little extra concentration because of the sudden narrative jumps.A lot of the frustrations encountered by our protagonist sound very familiar to what is encountered in America today. Maybe some of it a bit different because times have changed, but it is still concerning that a story written 70 years ago can feel so current. I will equate my feelings on this to a discussion I had with my wife about the show Mad Men. For those who have not seen it, the main storylines are always affected by what is happening in America in the late 50s and 60s. We noted how amazing it is how all the plots around the handling of racial inequality do not sound much different than today. Many may look at the news and say \"Wow, 2020 is crazy! I cannot believe what the response to racial inequality has become!\" But, if you take the time to look back, it has been this way for a long time – you may just not have been listening or watching close enough!A very good book worth checking out – both because it is a good and interesting story, but also because of the message it has to share."

He doesn't want to identify himself with Negro characters in terms of our immediate racial and social situation, though on the deeper human level identification can become compelling when the situation is revealed artistically.\" And here is when things get controversial, when some will stop reading, because to speak of race relations in America is to risk offending. Yet how can you not, when you've just watched someone you love go out for an early morning jog only to head back seconds later, with mounting nervousness, just to grab an ID?Artistic revelation, yes, this is how I would describe this novel.\"Though invisible, I am in the great American tradition of tinkers. That makes me kin to Ford, Edison and Franklin. Call me, since I have a theory and a concept, a \"thinker-tinker.\"Only a few protagonists can bind you, hands and feet, to their inner thoughts like this narrator can; only a few chosen writers can combine dramatic dialogue with self-exploratory meanderings and controlled prose that vividly reveals the life of one black man in America. Consider the metaphorical language Fitzgerald dazzles us with inThe Great Gatsby;think about the clairvoyance of George Orwell in1984,how he produced scripted scenes that came to life years later; remember the racial debate in William Styron'sSophie's Choice,recall the language and riveting voice of Toni Morrison's main character inHome,and you will have considered this novel.How can we not discuss race relations when a young boy just bled to death on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, his body left on the cold cement as a spectacle for hours, when even serial killers are fed elegant meals before they're executed in semi-private rooms? How can you not talk about theinvisible manwho was choked to death on the streets for selling loose cigarettes, even as he screamed,I can't breathe;or how about theinvisible young manwho was shot to death for strolling in his own neighborhood, wearing a hoodie? I could continue with the list that has been growing since the past year.\"Right now in this country, with its many national groups, all the old heroes are being called back to life--Jefferson, Jackson, Pulaski, Garibaldi, Booker T. Washington, Sun Yat-sen, Danny O'Connell, Abraham Lincoln and countless others are being asked to step once again upon the stage of history…Destruction lies ahead unless things are changed. And things must be changed.\"I get chills when I think that those words were written years ago, and yet they are relevant today.You don't talk about these things around peers-- it's ano-no,like speaking of religion or politics. Instead, when you must censor the confusing and nauseating moments you have once you consider how such tensions affect your life, you turn to books. I reached for this book off my shelf and Ellison's words placed within me a sense of understanding and calm like no other writer could at this moment (this makes me take a moment of silence for non-readers). This book is devastatingly beautiful in its cold-hearted truth and individual perceptions. This narrator grows and develops from a young, black, college boy who has not been around his white counterparts, to a learned young man who slowly understands his invisibility and most importantly, understands how everyone--black and white--contributes to his invisibility. It is simply a story of self-discovery as seen from the perspective of a black character. Both tragic and enlightening, it is rife with imagery, unique cadence, \"dialect,\" and rhythmic expose (and a few choice words that could be off-putting for some). I'm glad I chose it and it chose me.Here beneath the deep indigo sky, here, alive with looping swifts and darting moths, here in the hereness of the night not yet lighted by the moon that looms blood-red behind the chapel like a fallen sun, its radiance shedding not upon the here-dusk of twittering bats, nor on the there-night of cricket and whippoorwill, but focused short-rayed upon our place of convergence; and we drifting forward with rigid motions, limbs stiff and voices now silent, as though on exhibit even in the dark, and the moon a white man's bloodshot eye."

        "user_review": "I put off reading this book for years, intimidated by its length and its venomous reputation. When I finally dove in, I definitely found lots of venom but lots of anti-venom too. Lurking behind all the nihilism in the title and particularly the struggles during his college years is a hidden (invisible?) optimism and dark humor I felt. In the US soon post-Obama, we have definitely moved forward superficially in the battle for equality and yet, Ferguson happened, Trump is happening and racism is still ever-present - rather than bodies hanging from trees from the Invisible Man's past, we are still in the car burning and rioting of the Invisible Man's \"present\" and have not moved on. This book made me once again interrogate my own feelings on racism and challenge my \"idées reçus\". It remains a text that is vibrant and relevant. I would recommend following this with Roth's The Human Stain which is another incredibly written novel about how Coleman Silk(zwieg) tries to be come invisible. If only the US would truly look into the deeper causes of racism, perhaps it would prevent another disaster like that of this present election cycle and I would not want to be invisible myself."

If I were making a list of the 10 Best Novels About America, this would be at the top.*I first readInvisible Manin a college literature course, and my 19-year-old self liked it, but rereading it now was a really powerful experience. I definitely appreciated it more and admired Ellison's vision. This novel is the story of a black man in America. We never learn our narrator's name and we don't know what he looks like, but he feels invisible because of his color.When we meet our narrator, he is living alone in an underground room in a building near Harlem. He tells stories from his life, and we see all the times he was treated unfairly, misunderstood, wronged, stereotyped, and ill-used. A good example is a famous early scene known as the \"Battle Royal.\" Our narrator, who was a high school student at the time, was tricked into a boxing match, fighting other young black men, all of whom are blindfolded. The scene is horrifying and gut-wrenching for the way the white bystanders dehumanize the young men, laughing when they are brutally injured, and then rob them of their promised pay.In the stories, we see how our narrator tried to play by the rules and work hard, but he is constantly thwarted or manages to make a misstep, because so many of the rules are unwritten. Another memorable scene is when our narrator, who is a good public speaker, catches the notice of a group called the Brotherhood and is asked to help better the conditions for residents of Harlem. Like so many of his other experiences, our narrator is misused and misled, and he has to think fast to survive. By the end of the book (which is also the beginning), we see how much faith he has lost in his situation ever improving. Our young narrator had such high hopes and grand ambitions! Now he's abandoned in a forgotten room, with electric light his only companion.Truly, it's impossible to summarize the breadth of stories in this novel. There is so much meaning and symbolism in everything that happens to our narrator -- at one point, the poor man gets trapped in an underground coal bin and nearly starves to death -- that I can understand why this book is so widely assigned in literature courses. Lots to discuss!I listened to this on audio, narrated by the actor Joe Morton, and it was an incredible performance. I highly recommend this novel, and if you like audiobooks, I encourage you to check out Morton's version. A very high five stars for Ralph Ellison.*Note:As soon as I typed the words \"10 Best Novels About America,\" my mind started racing to decide what else I'd put on the list. Steinbeck'sThe Grapes of Wrath, for sure. Fitzgerald'sThe Great Gatsbywould make the cut. Lee'sTo Kill a Mockingbird, obviously. Hawthorne'sThe Scarlet Letterwould be good for the Puritan element. Wharton'sThe Age of Innocenceand Connell'sMrs. Bridgeare personal favorites. Mark Twain should probably get some billing. Hmm... I need to get Native American representation, plus something about the immigrant experience. If you have suggestions to round out the list, please share.Opening Paragraph\"I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allen Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination -- indeed, everything and anything except me.\"Favorite Quotes\"What and how much had I lost by trying to do only what was expected of me instead of what I myself had wished to do?\"\"I was never more hated than when I tried to be honest.\"\"And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone's way but my own.\"\"I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself.\"\"For, like almost everyone else in our country, I started out with my share of optimism. I believed in hard work and progress and action, but now, after first being 'for' society and then 'against' it, I assign myself no rank or any limit, and such an attitude is very much against the trend of the times. But my world has become one of infinite possibilities. What a phrase - still it's a good phrase and a good view of life, and a man shouldn't accept any other; that much I've learned underground. Until some gang succeeds in putting the world in a strait jacket, its definition is possibility.\""

This assertion is disproved in the 2007 biography of Ellison by Arnold Rampersand… …Ellison ultimately wrote over 2000 pages of this second novel, most of them by 1959. He never finished.incredible, huh? one is reminded of malcolm lowry who wrote the (unfuckingbelievably great) masterpieceUnder the Volcanoin 1947 and never published again. at the time of lowry's death many half-completed manuscipts were discovered which were meant to be part of a multi-volume cycle of novels of which he was too mad and drunk to properly control.interesting to wonder what it is that separates those people who struggle to produce a single work from those who seem to vomit the stuff out – what separates a lowry from an updike? a vermeer from a picasso? a fassbinder from a kubrick?and then there are those artists who clearly had a single vision and despite laying it all out... they continue. when i'm global dictator i'm planning on putting a stop to this. paul auster is at the top of the list. he's sent to siberia and everything afternew york trilogyis 'disappeared'.anyone have any more suggestions?(mention post-smiths morrissey and you're immediately unfriended)"

It was quite an interesting class as the demographics were literally half African American and half Caucasian, thus spurring provocative discussions. Our professor had us read Ellison's masterpiece and even though I do not remember it in its entirety, I remember the protagonist meeting Booker T Washington, George Washington Carver, discussing the talented tenth and black universities, the back to Africa movement, etc. All in all, Invisible Man stands out as one of the top three books I read in college and I will have to reread it when I have the time."

        "user_review": "\"It's not an important novel. I failed of eloquence and many of the immediate issues are rapidly fading away.\" said Ralph Ellison in an interview afterInvisible Manwas published in 1952 and was showered with praise & won the National Book Award (& since then is a regular in lists of greatest 20th century novels.)Regarding the fading away of immediate issues : in one episode, a black guy is chased by a cop, turns and lands a punch on the cop, who falls, points his gun and shoots the black guy dead. This whole sequence up to and including the community's outrage and the local politician's grandstanding has been replicated beat for beat in all those recent police killings (and the next one when it comes) in the USA. The duplication was stunning. So with respect, Ralph was wrong about the fading away of some of his issues. Unfortunately.WHERE DO I BEGINThis is quite a tough book to review. It's big and very loud. There is a long winding road our unnamed young black man takes from true believer to bitter cynic, and this happens not once but twice.You could say he is an invisible man, not seen as a real person by anyone, and at the same time, it takes him a long time to see through the fabrications of other people. I guess you could say that!Firstly he gets disillusioned with his black college – specifically with the nasty unprincipled Principal. Then he moves to Harlem and gets employed by the Communist Party, which RE calls the Brotherhood, and I'm not so sure he joins as a true believer, but he gets on board with the program :We recognised no loose ends, everything could be controlled by our science. Life was all pattern and discipline.But he fairly quickly sees thatI was simply a material, a natural resource to be usedAnd further, that when it comes to black people, the CP weren't enlightened at all :Outside the Brotherhood we were outside history; but inside it they didn't see us. It was a hell of a state of affairs, we were nowhereTHE B WORDAbout half of this large novel is about our guy and his struggles inside the Brotherhood, and sorry to say, the reader gets awfully tired of this B word. Maybe it is supposed to be a humorous exaggeration of the way communists talked, but it wears thin:\"Be more specific, Brother,\" Brother Garnett, a white Brother, said .andNow several brothers started to speak at once, and Brother Jack knocked for order. \"Brothers, please!\" Brother Jack said.WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES SAID AT THE TIMEParts of it consist of long and impassioned, sometimes hysterical, reveries which are frequently highly obscure. Other parts still seem grotesquely exaggerated or repetitious. And these strange interludes are overwritten in an ultra pretentious, needlessly fancy way. Spasms of torrential rhetoric, they obscure the point of some of Mr. Ellison's symbolic incidents and check temporarily the swift course of his story.(it sounds like a one-star review, but they actually did like it!)This is a book full of big talkers, and none bigger than our embattled narrator – really, it's him doing all the talking. And it is perfectly true that RE loves to conjure up towering piles of lurid anguished frothy clogged meditations at the drop of a hat. It gives a stop-start feeling to the whole thing. Maybe this is sacrilegious, but it could possibly might be that some of the more repetitious bitter self-accusations could have been snipped.LINGUISTIC NOTEThere is one f word, one more surprising c word, and several mentions of people being \"motherfoulers\", which I haven't come across anywhere else. Also one mention of the word \"groovy\" in an approbatory sense. Also : \"You black and beautiful!\" on p301.CONFRONTING STEREOTYPESThere are stereotypes everywhere you look. There is the toadying stooge Dr Bledsoe. There is a character Ras the Exhorter, who promotes Black Nationalism. There is an older black woman who briefly turns into the mother he never had. There is a white woman who wants our guy to pretend to rape her. There are the party apparatchiks, especially Brother Jack, sincere programmed robots the lot of them. There are looters and rioters from central casting. Hopping and skipping and ducking and diving, always in a mad rush, our guy spends the whole novel trying to figure out what the hell is going on.Eventually he decides the best place to be is in a basement underground, hiding from the world.It's such a melancholy image."

Crafting metaphor, simile, stream of consciousness, poetry, surrealism, absurdism, and a variety of narrative devices, Ellison's masterwork must be read.Using a narrator who is never named but from whose perspective Ellison explores themes of nationalism, race, identity, gender, equality, political reform and the rule of law. The style will remind some of Dostoyevsky'sNotes from Undergroundwhile the political and social commentary are reminiscent of Steinbeck and early Jack London.We follow our narrator from a rural Southern origin, through an unsuccessful term in college to the multi-cultural and politically active streets of Harlem. There this natural leader and orator finds that he is nonetheless \"invisible\": minimized and marginalized in the outer world even while being effective amongst \"The Brotherhood\", Ellison's amalgam of socialist / communist / progressive street wise organizations.As smooth, original and innovative as jazz, Ellison's great contribution to twentieth century literature should be on a list of books that should be read at least once in a lifetime."

As a young and very naive black student, he proceeds through his tumultuous life while constantly haunted by his grandfather's dying words.The beginning chapters share how(OMG!)he was treated in a Harlem basement just prior to being awarded a \"scholarship to a state college for Negroes\" for his important and memorable high school speech, but memorable for me was how he ever redelivered the speech in the horrific condition he was in at the time.Our protagonist is a young man who tries to do everything according to the rules, but disaster always seems to follow him around causing chaos and big trouble. Believe me when I say this dudecannotget a break. He can't even dispose of trash without being hassled; he just goes on and on from one catastrophe to another, and all he wants is an education....a job...to be relevant...and to be visible.Filled with treachery, dirty tricks and acts of betrayal,INVISIBLE MANis a memorable and insightful must readespeciallyas we look at our society today.1953 National Book Award winner."

        "user_review": "This is strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist drama from the early 20th century. It suffers from an inability to actually characterize anyone beyond the protagonist. Every other character is crushed by the need to represent a whole class or demographic. All of the other figures are episodes in his life, his personal development, his realization of society's deep-seated decay and his inexorable (and predictable) movement towards disillusionment. Which is to say that it is a heavy-handed, young, stereotype filled book.Yes, it is a worthy historical object. Yes, it is an interesting foil to other pieces of American literature (which does not have too many books of this variety); but I don't think it deserves great praise if it is judged on its own merits. The prose is nothing special, the dialect isn't handled with particular grace, it has an irritating tendency to state the obvious and to self-interpret and the author actually takes the time to call attention to the fact that he is choosing to rant at you for the last five pages--a total admission of weakness.I am, however, giving it two stars in the \"it was okay\" sort of fashion. I'm not upset that I read it. I just won't read it again, teach it or reccommend it to anyone."

If I hadn't known that the novel was published in 1952, I would have sworn it was a contemporary tale. Does that mean Ralph Ellison was ahead of his time, or that time has stood still and nothing has changed in 64 years? So many of the quotes and positions of The Brotherhood could be taken right out of the mouths of our current crop of politicians on both sides of the U.S. presidential race today that it chilled me to the bone.Some favorite quotes:\"My God, boy! You're black and living in the South - did you forget how to lie?\"\"Play the game, but don't believe in it...that much you owe yourself. Even if it lands you in a straitjacket or padded cell. Play the game, but play it your own way. \"\"Be your own father, young man.

What a waste, what a senseless waste!\"\"For the first time, lying there in the dark, I could glimpse the possibility of being more than a member of a race.\"\"And I knew it was better to live out one's own absurdity than to die for that of others\"\"Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in the face of certain defeat. Our fate is to become one, and yet many.....\"I choose to use Mr. Ellison ' s words instead of my own, but I will repeat my first statement: This book is brilliant."

It made me wish I had a teacher and classroom full of students to help me through it. It was refreshingly honest and bold and eloquent.I struggled with this rating because my experience of reading this book was difficult and laborious. I think some context about the work would have helped me to engage. I wasn't sure what I was delving into when I started - only knowing that it was a book on the top 100 greatest American novels of all times. I spent the first half of the novel orienting myself to what the author was trying to do. It was jarring and confusing reading the book without the anchor of historical importance, literary context, etc... By the last quarter, I was fascinated and moved... but up until that point I found myself lost and often dreading opening the book.With books of this type, books of cultural importance, books with deep symbolism and message, I find it helpful to have a preparation in reading it. My experience of the book was skewed because I went in expecting a good story but found instead a story that was heavily symbolic and in every turn. It took me a while to get my focus off the plausibility or likability of the story and characters and onto the message the book was trying to convey. I wonder if my experience would have been better had I known what I was reading. The plot was a framework on which to hang the ideas. The plot was secondary. I made a great error by skipping the introduction.I often avoid reading the back of books or reviews or even the introduction before hand because they give away the story. However, here is a book where I did myself a great disservice by skipping all that. If I were going to be very responsible - I would start again on page one and reread this book from the platform on which I now stand.... but... its 600 pages and I've got a to-read list a mile long. I want to say that I will attempt this book again in the future knowing what I know now... but I can't promise.In the meantime, I plan to read introductions more often.This book not only taught me and challenged me on issues of race relations, questions of identity, problems with ideology, etc... but it challenged my understanding of what it means to be a good reader. I read this book wrong and therefore I nearly wasted it."

He decides now to stay 'invisible' and live an underground life.This book reminded me of Dostoevsky'sNotes from the Underground, with its almost unbearable openness, and Celine'sVoyage au bout de la nuit, with its unadulterated negativity. The style is dazzling and at the same time concise. Only at the end I was a bit disappointed: after the apocalyptic scenes of riots and plunder the story expires on a false note, because we again turn to the starting point.This is a harsh testimony of discrimination against African Americans in American society in the years 1940-50, but by extension it refers to all the 'little'/'invisible' people, even in our present society (migrants, refugees ...) and in some way also an illustration of Sartre's \"L'Enfer c'est les autres\". But still it ends with a clear call for commitment and action. No doubt, one of the great novels of the 20th century."

But part of me thinks I needed to wait to read this. Maybe, and this is hard to admit, maybe I wasn't ready for Ralph Ellison's masterpiece in my twenties or thirties. It was a fever dream. A jazz narrative. A hallucination of pain, beauty, struggle, and life. It was a Hegelian dialectic. It was a black whale just as real as Melville's Moby Dick. It still has me firmly in its grip.

Personas que para sobrevivir tendrán que adoptar una máscara que posiblemente acabará formando parte de su propia personalidad, obligados a medir constantemente sus palabras, sus acciones y hasta sus propios pensamientos y sentimientos, a tener cuidado con todo y con todos. Un estado de cosas que se complica aún más al tener que convivir con el servilismo acomodaticio de muchos que en su misma situación la soportan resignadamente, cuando no la fomentan y la consolidan, o con los que cínicamente la aceptan y la utilizan en beneficio propio. Y todavía más si uno se siente, como el narrador y protagonista de la novela, responsable de tal estado de cosas y con la necesidad de ponerle remedio.\"Te enseñaron a aceptar la insensatez de los viejos como el que tienes ante ti, incluso en el caso de que los considerases unos lamentables payasos. Te enseñaron a actuar como si les respetaras y reconocieras en ellos una autoridad y un poder que tienen en tu mundo la misma naturaleza que la autoridad y el poder de los blancos ante los que ellos se humillan y mendigan, a los que ellos temen, aman e imitan. E incluso te enseñaron a aceptar la actitud de esta gente cuando furiosos o despectivos o ebrios de poder te amenazaban con un látigo o un palo, sin que tú pudieras permitirte contestar su ataque sino tan sólo evitar sus golpes...\"Junto a esta cuestión racial, trasladable a cualquier otro campo de marginación social, la novela trata el problema de la organización de la lucha contra tal estado de cosas y en cómo funcionaban (funcionan) estas organizaciones. La crítica es furibunda, quizá demasiado.La mucha inocencia y optimismo que caracterizaba la lucha obrera de principios del siglo pasado, plasmada en frases como\"Día llegará en que el trabajo y la diversión sean una misma cosa, porque reinstauraremos el placer en el trabajo\", se mezclaba con el férreo control del pensamiento y la dura disciplina de partido que veía todo cuestionamiento como una traición a los fines y a las ideas. Un control y una disciplina cuyas consecuencias eran más sangrantes en cuanto muchas veces respondían exclusivamente al ego y a las ambiciones de quienes lo ejercían.\"Ahora sé que los hombres se diferencian entre sí, que la vida está infinitamente dividida y diversificada, y que sólo en la diversidad cabe hallar el equilibrio verdadero.\"La novela es dura y poética, valiente políticamente, febril emocionalmente y más que notable literariamente hablando. No comparto en absoluto la opinión de aquellos que califican su lectura de difícil o pesada. Es todo lo contrario, la novela está repleta de escenas emocionantes en más de un sentido, de grandes diálogos y, aunque abundan las reflexiones y disquisiciones políticas y sociales, también hay acción, intriga y suspense. Una gran obra."

        "user_review": "I'm embarrassed to admit that for many years I thought this book was the basis for the Claude Rains movie in which his wardrobe consisted largely of sunglasses and Ace wrap. Once disabused of that notion, I still was slow to read it because the title suggested a character that, while not literally invisible, was of so little importance that his very existence wasn't noted by others. Obviously, this is a treatise on racism and, as I already know that racism is bad, what's the point of reading it?Fortunately, I read it anyway and found it to be a stunningly brilliant book, the National Book Award winning story of an unnamed young black man's rise andfallas a community organizer in Harlem during the 1930s and 40s. It does have a lot to say about racism but does so without finger pointing or animosity, displaying it in all its forms, from the ultra-degrading smoker scene in chapter two to the ill-conceived gaffs by well-meaning acquaintances and Brother Jack's imperious\"The brother does not sing!\"In places it felt as if no page was without some subtle, or unsubtle, slight being rendered to the point where I thought of the old torture calleddeath by a thousand cuts.While no assessment of the black experience in America would be complete without a discussion of racism, Invisible Man is so much more than that. I could talk for hours about the many, many fascinating ideas that Ellison imparts, but I will settle for describing one chapter out of the many great ones Ellison created. In this chapter, our narrator has managed to find a job at a paint factory. Approaching the building he sees a sign that says \"KEEP AMERICA PURE WITH LIBERTY PAINTS\". Nothing more is said about the sign but I immediately flashed on a conversation in which a woman once told my aunt that \"It's so rare these days to find someone who is pure\" (pronouncedPEW-uhh). From there it was an easy leap to picture a Klan rally with a fiery orator expressing the need to \"keep America pew-uhh\". Once on the job, our narrator is tasked with mixingOptic Whitepaint, a paint so white you can paint a chunka coal and you'd have to crack it open with a sledge hammer to prove it wasn't white clear through\". The joke, though is that in order to make this 'purest white that can be found' paint, you have to add to it 10 drops, no more and no less, of dead black dope. Again, Ellison makes no comment as to the absurdity of this but he didn't need to for the day hasn't passed since I read that chapter that I haven't pondered and theorized what he meant by it.Bottom line: Ralph Ellison is one of those brilliant authors who doesn't tell his readers what to think but he tells you a story and lets you run with it. I suspect I will be running for a long time to come."

        "user_review": "[update 4/27/2019]: I've spent years figuring out how to review this and maybe I'll never be satisfied, but here is anexcerpt from elsewhere on this site: Though I had been reading a fair amount of books given to me up to the winter of 2004-2005, It would be an assignment to do a report onRalph Ellisonthat would make me open my eyes to the world (and my place in it) in-general, and make me a serious book-reader in-particular. I do not consider myself a \"bibliophile\" at that time, but I was now on my way.I have always felt it difficult to describe the impact thatInvisible Manhad on me, but it woke me from my dogmatic slumber. I had, as most did, gone through a world in which I knew things were more precarious arbitrarily cruel for me because my ethnicity, but I did not truly question—or should I say had the question put to me why this was in such an intense way. In truth, I was not aware enough to question why or what it meant to go through life as a black man— always having a set of rules to go by that were different from…the \"mainstream\" Americans that I heard of on T.V. Life in my neighborhood was a precarious one in which danger and the threat of death was the ever-present miasma. Into this I sat down and opened a borrowed, beat-up copy ofInvisible Manand read that incredible first paragraph of the prologue:\"I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination -- indeed, everything and anything except me.\"By the time I had read the whole prologue, I was Godsmacked. I had felt like lightning had been written into my soul and was trying to understand what I had read. I was coming into my 14th year on this Earth and had never read any lines like that in my life. Maybe in the Bible there were epic passages close to that, but to find something that summed-up what my—and many peoples around me—life looked like and I had only read the first twelve pages of the novel. After a few months just reading that prologue and finally feeling confident enough to go on, I proceeded to read the rest of the novel and decided that I must read everything by this man and understand how to understand the world as he did.[update 9/27/2013: OH BOY, seems like this book has made thenews...and yes human stupidity is involved. I have never made it a secret on this site that I am a HUGE fan of this book. When I found out that this book had been banned by Randolph County [school board], North Carolina for not having any \"merit\", on the weekend before banned books week, the irony could not be more incredible. The book details the personal, cultural, and existential alienation and forcedinvisibilityof the main character and others like him. It won the National Book Award in 1953 beating out Earnest Hemingway'sThe Old Man and the Seaand John Steinbeck'sEast of Eden. It has been ranked in almost every list of greatest novels of the 20th century and is one of, if not the greatest, novel of post-war America. The fact that this book could be banned in the 21st century means that it is still important and the themes it brings up more alive than when it was written. The thing about banning a book is that you usually increase interest in it that way and it was no exception here as demand for the book doubled days after it was banned. What surprised me was how forceful and decisive public outcry was that only 10 days after it was banned(5-2 vote), the ban itself was overturned(6-1 vote). So it seems our nameless narrator can, for the time being, come out of his \"hole\" in Randolph County, NC.][Original Review]...I don't know where to began with this one. I guess everyone who likes to read has that one book. This book is that to me. Before I read this book I didn't know that I had a opinion or view on anything really especially not race or politics. I picked this book up in the 8th grade as apart of an assignment I had to do on the author and my aunt just happened to have a beat up copy of this book. Let's just say that it opened my eyes to the world around me and I still can't fathom the impact that this book has had on me. I have read many books since some could be considered \"better\" but I still hold this book (closest) in my heart and well I know this isn't a proper review (I may yet do one of those later) this is a book I would not have to think twice on recommending to anyone."

        "user_review": "A powerful novel; one of the must reads. Written shortly after the Second World War it is the classic study of invisibility; what it means not be be \"seen\" in society. Set in the US it is an unflinching analysis of racism at all levels of society. The unnamed narrator starts in the South at college and continues in New York. Ellison pours into his writing his frustrations with the attitude of the left in America just after the Second World War.There are some memorable characters, I would like to have seen more of Ras, who was a fascinating and complex character. There is a rich vein of humour in the book, but there is a brutal realism as well. The opening of the book is one of its great strengths as Ellison sets the stall for the whole novel. The narrator's initial hopes are gradually dashed and disillusionment very slowly sets in. He sees the suffering of those around him and the practical effects of racism and discovers he has a voiceand can move people. What to do with that voice? This is where the Brotherhood comes in.The Brotherhood is a left-wing/Marxist organisation commited to radical change in society and Ellison is reflecting his own experiences with the left. The narrator is given a job with the Brotherhood, to assist with their efforts in Harlem. The Brotherhodd have sections which deal with different aspects of their work and the committee dictates policy and practice. The narrator is taken out of poverty and given a new flat, but is bound by policies which he does not always understand. At one point the narrator is taken away from Harlem to work on the issue of women's rights because the committee disapproves of some of his actions. The incendiary climax can clearly be seen coming, but is no less shocking and poignant; the futility of it all is striking. The real villains are the Brotherhood. The racists are, well, racist and behave as you would expect. However the Brotherhood are about equality and change in society and ought to know better, but they turn out to be just as racist and lacking in compassion as the rest.I remember being involved in debates in my youth concerning left wing politics. Whether it was race, gender, sexuality, the environment; everything was secondary to the primacy of how Marx said things should happen in terms of revolution and change; economic issues were always primary. Others issues when it came down to it were irrelevant, a great mistake as Ellison powerfully shows. The Brotherhood use the race issue when it suits them and discard it when it does not without a thought for the people involved.I'd like to say that things are completely different to when this was written; in many ways times have changed, but there are still indicators that old attitudes may be dormant rather than gone. When times are difficult people still vote for those who play on fears and prjudice (the last few days in the UK have shown that); outsiders are still stereotyped. That is what makes this book and Ellison's message so important."

Δεν έψαχνα κάτι να με συγκλονίσει το περασμένο καλοκαίρι. Πειραματιζόμουν με τον εαυτό μου, προσπαθώντας να με ξυπνήσω από μια λαίλαπα κακομοιριάς, αυτοοικτιρμού και κολλήματος με επεισόδια του Πουαρώ στο youtube. Στην πορεία, παράτησα πάρα πολλά βιβλία. Το βιβλίο αυτό δεν το παράτησα, γιατί με δάγκωσε στα μούτρα. Δεν είχα κανένα βαθμό διάθεσης να συγκινηθώ, δεν είχα καμία όρεξη να εμβαθύνω, ούτε να ξενυχτήσω, ούτε να καπνίσω πολλά τσιγάρα. Αυτό που ήθελα ήταν, σχολώντας απ' τη δουλειά, να ξεχνάω πως υπάρχω. Δε μπορώ να αποφύγω το κλισέ που λέει ότι βλέπεις τι συμβαίνει στον κόσμο σου και λες ξύπνα ρε κακομοίρη, ρε παρεξηγημένε και δες πως κάποια πράγματα έχουν συμβεί και έχουν αποκτήσει μια δολοφονική ομορφιά, σαν ιστορίες, που όμως δεν ήταν ιστορίες. Μπορεί αυτό το βιβλίο να μην είναι η Ισπανική Διαθήκη, που περιγράφει μια κορυφή. Αλλά μιλάει για τον αργό θάνατο, που μπορεί να καταφέρει η πλειοψηφία πάνω σε ένα λαό, που παρόλ' αυτά δεν παράτησε την κουλτούρα του, δεν αφέθηκε τόσο πολύ. Και όμως αυτό, αποτελείται από πολλές μικρές ιστορίες ανθρώπων, που δεν τα πήγαν τόσο καλά. Που συμβιβάστηκαν, που έσκυψαν το κεφάλι, που είπαν συγνώμη και σας ευχαριστώ που μου πατάτε το πόδι. Είναι μια ιστορία ενηλικίωσης και εμβάθυνσης κι αυτοπροσδιορισμού. Και μπορεί να μη τα λέω τόσο καλά, να μην τα αναλύω ιδιαίτερα, αλλά είναι ένα βιβλίο που μιλάει για το βάθος. Το βάθος που υπάρχει μέσα από τα μάτια, μέσα από το αίμα, αυτή την κεντρική ιδέα που συνδέεται με νευρώνες και φλεβίτσες με την κεντρική εικόνα, που τόσο πολύ διαφορετικούς μας κάνει και την ίδια στιγμή, τόσο πολύ κύκλωπες. Και όλοι έχουμε υπάρξει αποκλίνοντες και όλοι έχουμε συμβιβαστεί και όλοι θα θέλαμε να μην υπάρχει κάτι παραμέσα και να ποδοπατάμε με ευχαριστημένο μαζοχισμό τον εαυτό μας, μαζί με τους άλλους. Έλα όμως, που κάτι υπάρχει. Κι αυτό που υπάρχει δε θα πάψει ποτέ να φαίνεται, όσο μικροί σα μπαλάκια κι αν γίνουμε, όσο απαρατήρητοι κι αν επιτρέπουμε να γίνουμε. Η ουσία μας είναι εκεί."

        "user_review": "This book is packed with so many important themes and ideas it's amazing that it's so readable and tangible. WEB DuBois's concept of double consciousness kept coming to mind as I read this - our black narrator couldn't be his authentic self because he was constantly treading and adjusting his words and actions to what others expected of him. How can a black man be sure of his identity when everyone who interacts with him sees what they themselves project or expect to see in his black body?Ideas were paired frequently, black and white of course, but also blindness and invisibility, stereotype and prejudice, subservience and leadership, integrating and segregating. We follow our narrator whose life reflects a lot of black experience and history including emancipation, coming from a sharecropper family and a grandfather who had been freed; the diaspora, coming north after fleeing college; low level factory work segregated where black labor does the hard and important parts but the white workers get the credit and higher wages; inability of competing ideologies to solve the problems facing the black community in the face of relentless put downs by whites, police and social policies.Deep and dark, and yet surprisingly and beautifully hopeful at the end. Not just an important book but very moving and readable too."

        "user_review": "The chief irony, as has been noted through article headlines, is that in drawing a most stunning portrait of an invisible man, Ralph Ellison became arguably the most visible black writer of all time (Toni Morrison, assuredly would also receive votes). The irony being a result of Ellison using key events of his life as a foundation for the major plot points of his novel (attending an all black college, a move north, communist association), and then after telling this story of invisibility suddenly garnering praise and winning awards. Yet this irony is most keenly viewed through our 21st century eyes; we must remember that Invisible Man was released in 1952, a full dozen years before The Civil Rights Act. And thus, for Ellison, his visibility was mostly seen as the rise of a great Negro writer despite his best efforts to shed that appellation. And, to put it bluntly, the critics of his day were wrong. IM is not just a great work of African American fiction, it is a great and timeless work of art.Ellison is able to paint the struggle of Invisible as rationality (education, logic, reason) versus irrationality (patronization, racism, Jim Crow). The hues of paranoia that shade Invisible foreshadow Pynchon, and DeLillo, writers whom, to be sure, do not work with Negro themes. Invisible is universal because he represents any rational man who attempts to navigate an irrational society. The specific plot points obviously deal with black themes of racism and black identity, but in no different way than Philip Roth deals with anti-semitism, and Jewish identity. Ellison also incorporates nuanced symbolism borrowed from Europe's Modernist movement: the black puppet that Tod Clifton sells, the briefcase that accompanies Invisible on his journey, the paint company representing white supremacy (whose paint is used on goverment buildings). These are more out of Joyce, or Eliot, than Langston Hughes.And yet, within this Western-styled novel that contains a universal narrator and protagonist, the most advanced ideas of black identity are explored. Invisible is a white man's destiny, as that man decides to treat black colleges as a way toward building a legacy, not toward black equality. Or the Brotherhood (a loose parallel of the communist party, with whom Ellison had a falling out) using racial inequality and blacks frustration with the status quo to help agitate and propagandize: not in order to truly help blacks gain equality, but in order to boost membership and further their cause of spreading communism. At every turn Invisible is used, never asked for his opinion or ideas, but told what is best for him. Even the black authority uses Invisible - the brutal Dr. Bledsoe who sells out Invisible by subtly manipulating him, encouraging him to run, nigger, run. And this drives him underground, this irrationality that allowed a nation founded on freedom to contain four million slaves, that allowed tenants such as seperate but equal, that allowed a master novelist and artist to be called a Negro writer. And yet within IM there is hope of reconciliation: where the Prologue (which reads more as a Foreword) is filled with violence, drug use and theft, the Epilogue (reading as an Afterword) contains philisophical gestures of understanding, and reluctant acceptance. Just as Ellison attempted to reach across racial lines (sometimes to the detriment and consternation of other black writers and intellectuals) and use his individual intelligence and creativity to push white racial prejudice further into the realm of irrationality. But Ellison also bemoaned his own race's unwillingness to seriously take on Western art and ideas and not just fall back on minority provincialism (to use his words). Because to Ellison, blacks are not just minorities they are part of the American concsiousness and he should know, he gave them their voice."

        "user_review": "InInvisible Man, an unnamed narrator moves through a series of events that highlight racism and inequality both in the society and in the people within the system.This is a book that is difficult to describe and may need to be experienced.The writing is powerful and builds like a punch in sections. I listened to the audiobook while on a walk through the woods so maybe that's why I was so sensitive to the rhythms.I'm not a black man and I've never walked a mile in his shoes, but this book gives a short sojourn into another person's life.The material is sobering and shocking, at times, lyrical and beautiful in others. Rather like life.At the end of the book, I found myself hopeful for the narrator. Hopeful that he would move forward from all of the challenges that he faced into a new dawn of understanding and racial equality.I'm always hopeful for improvement. Always.I think society sometimes uses aspects of our lives (like gender, race, social status, level of education, sexual orientation) to place people into tidy boxes or make them invisible like the narrator in Ellison's novel.One way to combat this evil is to know that we're not alone as we travel through life. We're all in this together. We see each other and acknowledge each other's strengths and weaknesses.We are seen and appreciated for our uniqueness by the communities we create. It's a big responsibility.I read this classic because it is painted on the staircase of the library where I work. I'm trying to read all of the classics recorded there in an effort to become \"classically\" well-read.What do I mean by classics? The most-tagged classics on Goodreads.com include such notable books as \"1984\" by George Orwell, \"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J.D. Salinger, and \"Of Mice and Men\" by John Steinbeck.Of those three, dear readers, I've only read one.So, the next problem with this aspiration of mine is — Where do I start? Who is the definitive voice when it comes to choosing classics?Who better than a library, I thought, literally.I had the privilege of working at O'Fallon Public Library during the Great Renovation of 2015 to 2016. One of my favorite pieces of improved library space (other than the bubble wall!) are the book spines that were painted on our stairs.I'd like to invite everyone to read along with me as I \"climb the stairs\" by reading the classics listed there. The goal is to share the books our community deemed important enough to preserve in our library space for all time.The next title on the steps isWatership Down, another classic that I have not had the pleasure of reading. (Portions of this review first appeared on the O'Fallon Public Library's blog.)"

        "user_review": "The Lovely Bones has got to be the most baffling, poorly written, jaw-droppingly bad book that I have ever set my eyes on. It is truly a black, black tragedy that the words in this book were placed in that particular order, published, and distributed. How could this have ever possibly been popular? Is it for the same reason that the song \"My Humps\" hit number one? I mean, I don't technically believe in burning books, but this novel really got me thinking. About burning it.If it serves any use at all, it might be a perfect guide on how not to write a book. Here are some of my gripes, problems and issues that we can hopefully use to prevent something like this from ever happening again to us, our children, or our children's children:It is filled with some of the worst sentence-level writing that I have ever encountered. From bad description to horrible grammar to utterly confusing metaphors, Sebold covered it all. A tell-tale way to spot a weak writer? They can't stop weirdly describing people's eyes. Don't believe me? Try this sentence: \"Her eyes were like flint and flower petals.\" Or this one: \"The tears came like a small relentless army approaching the front lines of her eyes. She asked for coffee and toast in a restaurant and buttered it with her tears.\" Really? She buttered the coffee and toast with her tears? Or this one, this time about someone's heart: \"Her heart, like a recipe, was reduced.\" What the hell?And here's my favorite eye description in the book: \"Her pupils dilated, pulsing in and out like small, ferocious olives.\" That's right. Ferocious olives. I've read MadLibs that make more sense than that.It seems to lack a plot. You know, that thing that books are supposed to have. I'll never forget my first workshop with Brady Udall, in which he threw my story onto the table and said, \"This isn't a story, Sarah, it's a situation.\" And as much as I despaired when I got home, he was right. Sebold has the same problem: her book is a really long situation. A girl dies and watches her family from heaven. Okay. That's nice. But what do the characters want? What drives the story forward? Nothing. The characters get older and keep bumping into each other. Things change, and things often do, but there is no forward movement and certainly no building of suspense.Since there's no plot, the ending is just a bunch of weird stuff happening. I read the last thirty pages on the train this morning, and couldn't stop a few outbursts: \"Oh, no she didn't!\" I'd say, talking to Alice Sebold and her crazy ways. She is just plain bold when it comes to doing whatever she feels like, and she feels like doing the weirdest stuff ever. It's not that I don't want to write spoilers here, it's that I can't even explain to you what happened at the end of the book. And I bet she can't either. I'm not exaggerating.Her characters never have interesting or complex thoughts. Not even the serial killer or the mother whose daughter was murdered. It seems that Sebold's characters do one of two things: they laugh (which means they are happy) or cry (to butter their toast, somehow, when they are sad). As you might guess, there is a lot of laughing and crying in this book. When a character is confused, they laugh and cry at the same time. This also happens often.I feel a little better after venting. But I'm still deeply sad and angry. I feel like my own writing might have been permanently damaged by reading this book… like a couple of… ferocious… olives?"

        "user_review": "One book, two rapes. How's that for a bargain? (The book only advertises one.) Yuck.The book in question isAlice Sebold'sThe Lovely Bones. I'm not giving anything away by saying it's a book about a girl (the narrator) who was murdered. That's revealed in the book's second sentence. It's also not a big deal to let you know she was raped and murdered by a neighbour, George Harvey. That all is related pretty early on. What isn't revealed until maybe the last fifty pages is that the girl herself, Susie Salmon, becomes a rapist.Ideologically, I'm not certain which one is worse. I could be persuaded.But the way the book presents the two incidents is markedly different. One is revealed in low lights and has a horror edge to it. It's seen unilaterally as an evil, wicked deed. The other is the book's highlight, the moment at which the author breathes a sigh of relief and says that everything else made right. I suppose it makes sense; the narrator probably wouldn't see her actions for what they were. But in the end, both George and Susie deal with their childhood victimizations in that manner typical to the criminal genre these days.Both George and Susie had horrible things happen in their formative years that leave long-lasting scars. The only difference is that George Harvey lived and Susie Salmon died. Not that it makes much difference. Susie is as alive a character as George for the purposes of the story. They both want what they want and care little for the well-being of the women who get in their way. The difference is that George Harvey is portrayed as the villain he is, while little Susie Salmon is treated as a hero.Those who have read the book may not have even noticed Susie's complete abandonment of moral sense or care for the woman she violates. After all, she doesn't exactly couch things in those terms. So here it is, laid out for you.When Susie was alive, there was a boy who liked her, Ray. In the years after her death, Ray grows up to be, in the narrator's view, an attractive young man. She watches him and loves him. Somehow, events conspire to allow Susie to possess the body of Ruth, a friend of Ray's. Susie uses the opportunity to seduce Ray and they make love several times in the course of a few hours. And then Susie has to go back to heaven. Leaving Ruth, a victim of Susie's power over her body.Imagine that you're Ruth. You wake up. Naked. Probably a little tender. Used. In the back of some bike shop. With a man in the shower. That's what I call horror. Not only was she not conscious or aware for any of the immediately preceding events, but the guy who's been really her only friend in the world is now naked and telling her that he screwed her brains out while she was unconscious. And even if he doesn't tell her that, there's a very short rail of evidence and it all points to that conclusion. And now. She could be pregnant. She could be diseased.Yep. The crowning act of love on the part of the tale's heroine is little more than a petty, rapacious act of power over the helpless woman who got in her way. Good job Susie Salmon. You and George Harvey should get along nicely.p.s. even though I called it a spoiler, I think that Alice Sebold spoiled the book. Not me."

        "user_review": "Haaaaaated it. I am one of those OCD literary nerds who takes on a war bunker mentality with books that I've started and dislike: \"I will see this through to the end.\"For \"The Lovely Bones,\" I made an exception.Somewhere, sometime, someone told Sebold she could write. That person should be made to apologize to me, in person, and to all other poor souls who were duped into buying this shlock.The literary press also needs to break out the cattails for a serious bout of flogging. Lev Grossman of Time Magazine is at the top of my flogging docket; he called this book \"a beautiful, sensitive, melancholy novel\" and repeated that claim a year later in a review for a book called \"The Dogs of Babel\" (a book just as terrible as The Lovely Bones). I can only assume that Mr. Grossman confined his reading to the zeros on the check accompanying the publisher's blurb or else has some sort of vitamin deficiency that causes his brain to process ham-handed tripe as \"beautiful\" art.It was Mr. Grossman's review along with the alluring premise of the novel (a young girl posthumously tries to make sense of the events that led to her death) that led me to order \"The Lovely Bones\" and \"The Dogs of Babel,\" which at the time were only available in hardcover. Financial reasons made this an extremely uncommon practice for me, and my experience reading both of those novels ensured that I would never do so again.To further illustrate how absolutely wretched this novel is, I'm going to provide a paragraph of background. The \"substance\" of the novel will be criticized in the subsequent body of this review.During the summer of 2003, I was occupying space as an intern at a company that accepted me at the last minute and had nothing for me to do. The company was white-collar and behemoth in office space. HR sent me to an deserted floor to file documents that took up, at most, 2 hours of my 8-hour day. Even in this vacuum of monotony, I could not finish this book. I chose to watch paint chip away, and pick up dust bunnies with recycled paper (I didn't have a broom) rather than finish this book.So with that said, I suppose I should actually mention something specific about the book I hated. My caveat here is that I am unwilling to punish myself by picking through a copy of the book for textual examples. I'm going by memory and online synopses alone.The narrator and victim is \"Susie Salmon.\" Let me stop there. SUSIE SALMON. That really should have clued me in, but I was too eager to see how the author would represent the afterlife, to catch a glimpse of this beautiful pain of looking a life that goes on without you.Unfortunately, Sebold managed to bleach out anything remotely interesting out of the plot in spectacular fashion. Heaven is a school, you see, not that Susie spends much time there or learns anything. Her rapist and murderer is a creepy loser while somehow being the dullest of all of Sebold's numerous dull characters. The \"reason\" for his murderous tendencies could be guessed by anyone who's ever even heard of a pop psychology book.You'd think her family would at least be interesting in grief, but Sebold reduces them to one note drones.Everything in The Lovely Bones is a gimmick, played cheaply for sentiment and with no other reward. I'd compare to a Hallmark movie, but Hallmark movies do not adopt the pretension that Sebold belabors with terrible pseudo-post-modernist metaphors.All of this would be bad enough, but what made me throw this book \"aside with great force\" is the offensive, and unjustifiable resolution to Susie's laments that she did not get to live. This unfairness, although poorly developed, was at least a cause of sympathy until Susie decides to forcibly correct it at the expense of others. In the hands of someone else, this last turn could've been bleak insight into motivations of the cycle of victimization but Sebold conveys not one iota of ambivalence.Much of my hatred of this novel results from its inexplicable popularity and commendation from people who have a responsibility to promote reading. I shudder to think who else picked up this novel convinced it was the best that the contemporary literary world had to offer. It is not my intention to slam those who enjoyed this book. If you did, I am glad to hear it. I love books, and I want others to love books. I simply fear that someone who is tempted out of a long vacation from reading might pick up a novel like this and give up the cause for lost."

        "user_review": "I worked at Borders for more than a year and I worked the boring ass registers, usually at night whic was always slow. I leaned there with my chin in my hand staring at the shelvesactually wishingthat I could help customers in their purchases. It's purely insane, but I think that's what happens anytime you place someone in any kind of confinement. The thing is that if I wasn't a register girl, I would haveconstant actual contactwith the books themselves.All lunacy aside, one book that I stared at the entire time was this one, cuz it was literally on the number one shelf in the front of the store for a good two years or so. It sounded interesting and got good critical reviews despite its sucess with the bookish Oprah-watching housewife types. So, I REALLY didn't wanna jump on the bandwagon and read it. But at the same time I would open it and try. But I just didn't get into it.Last week or so, I was reading a friend's blog and she talked about reading the book and how it was so affecting that she found herself driving to work in complete tears. From then on an invisible seed had been planted. I went to the library the other day to pay my fines ($2.75! Man.) and suddenly remembered the book.I read it in three nights. Sebold's voice is entirely unique. Never seen it before ever. I think that being allowed into the vision and point of view of another person is probably one of the awesomest feelings ever. I think that's what it is to be in love, actually. Get in someone's skin, sit in a recliner in a little theatre located behind their eye sockets, and just watch. Not judge, not worry, not affect. Just experience someone who is so not you.Sebold allows this on two levels. She sets you up in the front row seat right next to Susie the murdered and raped 14 year old while she watches her former world from Heaven. But she also delivers this language that is new, original, totally fresh and yet entirely accessible. At 3am. In bed. From a free city library borrow.Her characters are completely amazing individuals, but not unreal or impossible. The way she wrote the book, from Suzie's viewpoint, was definitely some work on her part. And she pulls it off. What I really enjoyed is the way she would sneak in these little pieces of info - I call them \" 'omg, are you serious?' mystery info nuggets\". She would just be writing a scene, and at an unsuspecting moment she'd just add in a little sentence. And ofcourse, since the story revolves around the grief of the family and the Susie's unsolved case, their are moment of utter thrill as the reader joins the characters in their search for understanding, motive and the killer himself. The sentences feel like when you've been looking for something non-urgent for a while, and it's not really a big deal to find it now or later, but when you do find it your like, 'Man, now I can do this, and this and that, cuz I finally found this thing that I've been inactively searching for for a while'. So, the nuggets definitely keep you reading and sometimes they even make you say, 'omg' out loud.As always, if you read the first few pages and hate it, then don't force the feeling. Just cuz I thought it was a total modern classic, don't mean anything if it really ain't your thing. Either way, truly a great story, even if your mom thinks so too."

        "user_review": "Out of my entire reading list for 2022, more people commented about The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold than all of the other books combined!The Lovely Bones begins with the tragic death of a fourteen-year-old girl, Susie Salmon (like the fish). From there, we follow Susie's family and friends as well as Susie's murderer.The Lovely Bones starts off very strong, and the impulse to read more is almost overwhelming. However, the book is downhill from there.Writing a book that begins with a death is very unusual. Most authors usually begin in the middle. Unfortunately, the death is the most interesting part of the book, so the rest of the book simply dragged. In my opinion, the plot was interesting, but the execution lacked.First, The Lovely Bones would have been more compelling as a short story. Another book that begins with a death is The Death of Ivan Ilych, and it is 86 pages. The Lovely Bones is 328 pages (in my copy). The author glosses over a number of years in a single chapter, highlighting a few key events. However, I didn't feel invested with this vague style of writing (telling rather than showing).Second, if I was the editor of this book, I would have given each character their own chapter. There were a great number of characters in this book, and the author should have gone deep instead of wide. I'm still not even sure who Hal is. And I was confused whose boyfriend was Lindsey's and whose was Susie's. Also, whatever happened to Len?Third, the ending is horrible, entirely forgettable, and almost laughable.Overall, The Lovely Bones had a strong beginning, but the storytelling should have been much stronger.A big thank you to everyone who participated in The Lovely Bones Readalong!Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

The tragic loss of a daughter accelerates her departure from those heavy burdens and into the arms of the detective working the case.-Father – obsessed to the point that he neglects the living members of his family destroying his relationship with his wife. Only in her absence is he able to fall in love with her \"all over again\".-Detective – his 'sob-story' past (wife committed suicide) explains his devotion to make sense of senseless death by solving cases of murdered women. This leads him into the arms of the latest victim's mother (who, incidentally, reminds him of his dead wife - eww).-Mrs. Singh – the exotic, wise, independent, and strong foreigner who calmly dispenses cool sage-like personal advice to near-strangers.-George Harvey – the 'odd-but-harmless neighbor' otherwise know as the psychotic pedophile/murderer who builds dollhouses in his spare time. Queue soundtrack with mangled version of a nursery rhyme transposed to a minor key ungainly lobbed from a detuned piano. Snippets from his mildly troubling childhood are revealed…explaining nothing.-Grandma Lynn – the often drunk but all-knowing grandmother with a 'wacky' liberal perspective on life.-I could go on…the youngest sibling who sees the ghost of Susie as his imaginary friend, the sister who struggles to become her own person from under the shadow of her dead sister, her boyfriend as the complete antithesis to the evil Mr. Harvey, her boyfriend's older brother as the macho gear-head with a heart of gold.The NarrativeThere is only the occasional passage where the narrator's voice sounds like that a teenage girl from the mid-seventies (\"Lindsay had a boy in the kitchen!\" – oh the giddiness of it all!). Small blessings. Cliché after cliché. If you haven't already gotten a sense of the hackneyed construction of this book please re-read the first page of this rant. Only a sportscaster from some small-town cable station would stand a fighting chance of besting Sebold in a contest of cliché slinging.The EndingWorthy of Hallmark. Every loose end is tied up with nobody owning up to the consequences of their actions (with the exception of Mr. Harvey, because he's bad, you see). The family is reunited, the murderer is murdered, the daughter marries her high school sweetheart and has a child of her own (thus proving that life does go on…sniff), and lastly, the teenaged ghost of murdered Susie Salmon transcends her personal minor heaven (a staging ground for spirits who persistently cling to the living world) by 'falling' back to earth, inhabiting the now 20-something body of a lesbian acquaintance in order to trespass into another person's home and have sex with the now 20-something boy she had a crush on shortly before her murder. The moral? Only after wilfully experiencing the delightful carnal pleasures of the flesh can one, even the spirit of a murdered teenaged girl, let go of those lost earthly pleasures and move on to a higher and presumably more enlightened plane of existence where you are free to smite those that have wronged you. Touching, really.The Lovely Bones reviews-Why do they always say \"brutal\" murder or \"brutal\" rape? Is that opposed to the \"wonderful\" murders and \"superb\" rapes in other novels?-Did any of these reviewers even read the book?! They just seem to be reading each other's reviews, praising the unique first person narrative of a protagonist in heaven and how it deals with such a horrifying topic. The fist person perspective does not offer anything new and the only thing horrifying here is that people consume mind-numbing garbage like this at an alarming rate.-There's nothing new here. What was the point? Aside from, paranormal sex is a wonderfully liberating experience for both the possessive-spiri"

I was greatly disappointed.How has this book become such a worldwide success? It's slow, boring and there is no real connection with any of the characters. I found myself disliking everyone in the book.The overall idea could have been very good, even though it isn't exactly original, but I just thought the author didn't make the most of this great idea that she had. The best part of the book, without meaning to sound gruesome and morbid, was the death scene at the beginning. I admit that it was creepy and well told, I read that and geared myself up for a good book. But for me, it was as if the story ended there and the rest was a load of slow-moving waffle. The great idea had come along, happened for a while, and then died a painful death with the protagonist. The characters weren't interesting enough to hold up the rest of the story, I was just relieved when I finally got to the end. It was a painfully boring book... and I've lost count of the times people have told me how much they love it - why? Did I miss something? I honestly feel like I've read a completely different book from everyone else... I do not understand it's popularity at all."

        "user_review": "This book has single handedly shown me that I spend too much time skimming and not enough time really reading and thinking about the books I have been reading. I have two kids and so I'm busy and I often find myself reading when I am stealing time or tired. But that is not even an excuse for this book. When i read the book I thought it was pretty good. Not great, but not bad. I liked the concept and the fact that the girl was the narrator. I like a murder mystery, so I liked the suspense of waiting to see if the guy would get caught, etc. So when all was said and done and I finished the book, I thought - yeah, okay. Not bad, but not great. Then I went online here and read the other reviews, particularly one by TheDane (http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16...) and I went - HEY!! That's right! I mean, the writing alone is something I should have picked up one had I really been paying attention. Pupils pulsing like olives?? Buttering toast with tears?? Umm... I really must have been distracted or skimming like crazy because that is ridiculous. And the real meaning of the final scene went WAY over my head, which I am somewhat ashamed to admit. When I read it, I really was like, yeah yeah, oh that's sweet she got one night with her boyfriend which she had been cheated of and all. But when you slow down and really think of this, the enormity of that is overwhelming. A young girl who dies after being RAPED. A girl who's first sexual experience was RAPE by an older man. A girl who actually barely knew this boy in her life. This girl can only let go of life after having sex. With that boy. That she really didn't know that well. That alone is enough to send of some big alarms. But then you add that she was allowed to go back to earth - to have sex??? Not see her family, not comfort her father and brother and sister? Not point out the killer?? Nope, heaven lets her go back, then of all times, not earlier when she wanted it more, or could have done more both for justice and her family? So the admission to heaven is teen sex? Really? The way to overcome deep grief and gain acceptance and peace is.. again, teen sex? Wow. I missed out as a teen because that was NOT my experience. Okay, now louder warning bells should have been going off. But the final issue - she takes over the body of a \"friend\". Without the girl's knowledge or permission. The \"friend\" who is a lesbian. And uses her body to have sex with a boy. Just taking over her body is a violation. Taking over her body and using that time to have sex is another violation. And to have sex with a boy, knowing that is the antithesis of everything this \"friend\" would have wanted or agreed to is yet another violation. What the hell??? And none of that gets brought up or mentioned. No, it is a feel good ending. yeah! I mean, I have some pretty close friends - some I have known for at least triple the time these two girls have \"known\" each other - and if I somehow managed to just steal their bodies and have sex with a woman?? Well, it would be good for me that I was already dead. That is a betrayal in the worst sense on so many levels it is shocking. And what of the possible consequences? Pregnancy? STDs? Never mind the \"lesser\" consequences of emotional damage, damage to their friendship, the trust issues, etc etc etc????? After thinking about it more and more, I was truly embarrassed to have not seen these dark and disturbing connotations, made all the worse for the fact that the author serves this up as the feel good ending - not noticing the irony at all of having the main character who was raped and violated in turn rape and violate a friend, while denouncing the first act as a heinous crime and lauding the second act as happy ending? So in short, I have learned my lesson and I am now making more of an effort to truly read and then think about what I am reading!!!"

The scenes from In-Between are one of my all-time favourites. And the moment when Susie's father destroys the ships in bottles is just the best; it keeps popping on my Youtube because I just watched so many times. So, if I go a couple of moths without watching it, Youtube is like: \"Here, watch it.\"Usually, I'm not much of an audiobook gal, but if there is a version which was narrated by Saoirse Ronan, I'm gonna listen to it!My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.Anyway, why am I talking about a movie here, right? Because I saw it first, I did not compare it with the book, and I believe if I knew the book previous to watching the movie, I would see it in a different light.However, right now, I see them as two separate entities, there is a movie I enjoy, and a book which is fantastic and both have the power to break my heart.\"And I was gone.\"It's very hard to describe this book without spoiling much. All I'm going to say that even reading quotes gives me the \"tension\" feeling in my jaw, which I usually have right before I'm about to cry. It just breaks my heart. Because of Susie. Because of the real Susies who go through the same thing she did. Because of their families. And because Georges Harveys exist in the real world.\"The living deserve attention, too.\"But I have to say that this book is right up my alley, I enjoy books when people die and get a chance to relive their last day to make things right, where they are still there and watch their families. It might not be for everyone — definitely something to consider before picking up this book."

The delicate sweet soul of a father; a grandmother with the heart of an empath; a sister whose youth and adulthood travel arm in arm; a numb and emptied mother; a young girl then grown woman living pierced on the periphery. This book is about the people in my life and yours whose very essence is pinned down to a spot in time and space--these lovely bones, growing in a soft-shelled skeleton around our lives. It is by turning the pages where these bones grow, that I could reflect on the wheel of life--what a joy (can you call it joy when it's sad?) to witness humanity breathing ceaselessly, moving forward, and loving without remorse. I am at peace to think that this sweet family, though scarred, will smile at another sunrise.To touch the living is a precious thing."

He finished what he started and dismembered her body as viciously as he ruined her innocence.He dumps her into sinkhole and throws at her charming bracelet in the pond!As her spirit flees from her personal heaven, she starts watching how her family struggle with their lives. She even watches her killer and sees him struggling, too, touching the knife he cut her throat, suffering from emotional turmoil. She wants him dead.She also finds a way to connect with a school outcast Ruth Connors. From now on there are so many resemblances you can catch with Swayze's Ghost. Even the ending has so many resemblances.The book started impressively, earth shatteringly strong and Susie's heart wrenching and extra traumatic, sad spirit story who is trapped in teenage body with a mature, experienced voice to tell her sadness about the people she left behind and her vengeance story was outstandingly emotional and well written.For too long, I was planning to read this book. I can only tell one thing, please stay the hell away from the movie adaptation. ( of course it's not about my hate for actress Saoirse Ronan!) After I watched it, I skipped this book for too long but now I understand they just ruined everything about the story starting with killing its essence and spirit!It's truly deep, compelling, unconventional and disturbing story but at least the ending was relieving, more hopeful and taking the emotional pressure out from your chest.It's a great book as my flashback Saturday choice.Here are some quotes I'd like to share:\"Sometimes the dreams that come true are the dreams you never even knew you had.\"\"Each time I told my story, I lost a bit, the smallest drop of pain. It was that day that I knew I wanted to tell the story of my family. Because horror on Earth is real and it is every day. It is like a flower or like the sun; it cannot be contained.\"\"Between a man and a woman there was always one person who was stronger than the other one. That doesn't mean the weaker one doesn't love the stronger.\"\"My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered.\"\"If I had but an hour of love,if that be all that is given me,an hour of love upon this earth,I would give my love to thee.\"\"There was one thing my murderer didn't understand; he didn't understand how much a father could love his child.\""

That said, the endless cloying sentimentality in this almost made me throw it in the bin on several occasions, and it contains the single worst simile I've ever encountered in an entire lifetime of book-reading."

        "user_review": "THE LOVELY BONES by Alice Sebold earned 5 intense stars from me!My Tease…Heaven'sInbetweenis for \"the watchers,\" those souls who aren't ready to leave behind their connections to Earth. Souls…who have unanswered questions or unfinished business. Who haven't learned to accept their deaths.Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon is a watcher.Although Susie knows that Mr. Harvey (whose house is in her neighborhood) raped and murdered her, none of the living know. At least Susie's father and her younger sister Lindsey have growing suspicions about the loner who has a bird's-eye-view of Susie's junior high school and the adjacent sports- and corn- fields from his second floor window. Trouble is, the police have no evidence to implicate Mr. Harvey. All law enforcement knows is that the eccentric widower answers all their questions.In herInbetweenHeaven, Susie has her own questions, only she doesn't know the answers. Should she spend her time watching Mr. Harvey, in hopes that he will be stopped? Or should she watch her family as they struggle to accept her death and move forward?Which focus will heal Susie so she can leave theInbetweenand transition to the Heaven intended to bring her peace?Thoughts…MESSAGE:For me, THE LOVELY BONES offers a spiritual message, which is remarkable since I don't remember religion being mentioned once!The story, however, is much more than its surface. From my perspective, THE LOVELY BONES addresses the ancient question of where we (the living and the deadnotresting in peace) should focus. Should we focus on plucking out the weeds (like vile Mr. Harvey) in our \"fields\" of existence? Or…should we focus on growing the corn or wheat or soybeans (which when healthy, will choke out the weeds)?This seems to be the very question character Susie Salmon struggles with.I can empathize with this internal conflict, as I wanted more than anything to have Mr. Harvey plucked from the Earth and thrown into burning Hell. To be frank, it wasthisdesired outcome that compelled me to flip the pages.In fact, I actually wanted to take away a star from my rating because…I didn't get what I wanted for a long, long time. Mr. Harvey lived on and on and even became secondary in the story. I started shouting to the author…WHAT ABOUT MR. HARVEY??? He's still on Earth STALKING AND KILLING young girls and women??? DO SOMETHING!NOW!!!Years later, something FINALLY does happen to Mr. Harvey, but it feels more by chance than by intention. (The movie made it seem like a deliberate intervention, but I didn't get that from the book at all.)But then I restored the star because…this is a story of acceptance and finding peace,noton delivering retribution. Of knowing what youcancontrol and what youcan't.About growing and finding peacedespiteevil lurking in cornfields or neighborhoods or parks or buses.Not sure about you, but this focus and practice are difficult to achieve. Which is why the message is so important. Which grows peace faster…growing goodness or weeding out evil? The answer is certainly worth thinking about!WRITING:The writing is outstanding. Even the simplest sentences carry emotional weight:\"Inside, my sister's heart closed like a fist.\"HUMOR:No doubt, it is hard to interject humor into a story like this; however, there is some humor found:\"Grandma Lynn predicted I'd have a long life because I had saved my brother's life. As usual, Grandma Lynn was wrong.\"OVERALL:This was an intense read that offered a surprising message.I highly recommend this 5-star read about finding acceptance and peace among the vilest of weeds.Note: This book contains triggers regarding rape and sexual violence toward children, girls, and women."

        "user_review": "3.5⭐The Lovely Bonesis a story told by fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon who was killed while on her way home. She walks through a cornfield on a freezing December of 1973 when her neighbor Mr. Harvey convinced her to check out the underground room he has built. Readers get a glimpse of Susie's heaven and follow her while she watches her family and friends.I felt it was very interesting to start with the death of the MC. I was hooked at the beginning of the book. It's my mistake to think this is a thriller which it is not, maybe more of a drama? Even though we witness what Susie's family goes through from the moment she was missing to realizing that she wouldn't return to finding her killer, I was not emotionally connected to the story or characters as I had hoped. In no way was this a bad book, but I wish I loved it more. I'm looking forward to watching the movie this weekend.The audiobook read by the author should be avoided if possible. Alice Sebold literally just reads it to you."

        "user_review": "\"These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections – sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at a great cost, but often magnificent – that happened after I was gone.\"I hardly ever read books when they are first released. I always seem to be a few years behind, for whatever reason. Sometimes this works to my advantage, as it allows me to avoid a degree of hype that surrounds certain books. I do remember seeing the blue cover of The Lovely Bones on shelves in every bookstore when it was released a few years ago and seeing mentions on best-sellers lists. But I didn't take much interest in it because, sometimes, when a book/movie/album gets so many rave reviews, I'll expect it to blow me through the roof and will end up disappointed when it's only mildly entertaining or moving (see: The Time Traveler's Wife).I prefer to go in with low expectations and let myself be surprised with greatness. Not that I'm a bitter person or anything. Not at all. Ok, I'm working on it.Anyway, I was visiting my tiny local library for the first time, searching for a book to check out, when I saw the blue spine peaking out from the shelf. Since I had already read the few classics they had in stock, and don't really go for Harlequin romance, I took Alice Sebold home with me. Much to my surprise, I finished the book in a day's time.It wasn't so much Sebold's writing style, which is good but not spectacular, or even the tinges of mystery in the plot that captivated me. It was the raw human emotion that she so perfectly conveyed through each character. The characters felt real—both their positive qualities and their shortcomings. The pain, confusion, regret, and maybe even hope that they each felt in their own ways really impacted me.The Lovely Bones is the story of a young girl who is raped and murdered in her neighborhood. She speaks to the reader from her version of heaven (it can be different for each person), and looks over her family as they unravel after the tragic event. Perhaps it had something to do with my already delicate state (I was home sick while reading) but the book managed to make me cry. More than once. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that, and the book snob in me would prefer to believe I am \"above\" sentimental plot devices, but to be honest—the book is just really sad.I also liked the subtle message of hope that carries through the novel, without reading like a \"Chicken Soup\" book. The ending isn't the overly hokey \"I will survive\" type, and still has a shade of melancholy, but seems to say that even through utter grief and personal devastation, life goes on."

        "user_review": "I was really disappointed with this book. The first half was easy enough to read and then unfortunately I started getting bored particularly when Sebold started rehashing the same old lines which was just frustrating after a while. However, if that was the only problem I had I wouldn't be complaining.There were a bunch of unfeasible \"random\" coincidences such as Samuel and Lindsey pulling off the road in the rain, running to the abandoned shack then running all the way home only to ... find out at the conclusion that Ruth's dad owns the house. What about Hal, what was the point of Hal's character? To be Grandma's sidekick? I felt like there was no point to these side-line stories and superfluous characters.I also would've liked to have seen some insight into the mother leaving and completely abandoning her family. So okay, I'm not the author and the author chose to not take that route but I think if you're going to include something as dramatic as that in the novel perhaps touch on it a little more. For me, it would've made it a juicier read. I didn't want know that she was working in a wine factory, I wanted to know what was going on in her head! I mean, she wandered back into the final pages, had a cup of tea with another random character, her son runs past because he has new drumset ... yikes.I'm not a believer in heaven but am interested in other's perceptions of it. I found Sebold's ideas disappointing. School buildings? A few people dressed up as snowflakes at Christmas time? A very random connection with her Grandfather? To me, this novel felt like a good first draft and just really felt like it needed a good edit, or a heavy rewrite.The ending was particularly irritating; falling to earth into a body to have sex with some guy who we didn't really care about ... for no reason? I was pretty confused because she'd watched her murderer stalk her sister hours (minutes?) beforehand and didn't use the opportunity on earth to confront her murderer, which is something I, and I presume many people, would've done. But okay, let's just accept that she's not that kind of person, the ending bothered me because the first half really did have promise but then Sebold threw me into an unexpected (and unwelcome) supernatural spin.Great idea. Poor execution. Maybe that's what everyone got so carried away with. The idea was grand - so grand that they were blinded by the weakness of the actual plot. Further, I guess people find comfort in the idea of heaven. The fact that we mean so much to people that we'll continue having such a huge impact on them once we're gone, that we get to watch them from above after we're dead (voyeuristic much?).All in all, if people love this book and it affects them, changes their life, their outlook, makes them feel warm and fuzzy, makes them tearful or full of rapture - that's a good thing. I'm just disappointed that such a top seller couldn't do that for me."

Even if I didn't like it, I don't think I'd find so much in it to HATE it. The approach is different, which some might call trite or some call imaginative. I think I just liked Susie. She spoke what was on her mind, the perspective was fresh and the subject wasn't typical. Maybe this was a product of hype? I hadn't heard of it until a few friends recommended it to me last week. It took me a few hours to read and I enjoyed it. I won't rave on it, but I appreciate a good story."

I don't read a lot of juggernaut pop-fiction, but at least with \"DaVinci Code\" I can see the appeal; this one's draw baffles me. Besides being uninteresting, there are two plot points that were just rancid:1. The mom suddenly deciding to return to her family when the dad has a heart attack.2. Susie possesses Ruth's body so she can fuck the med student. So if you die a virgin, God lets you back on Earth for a few hours to bang someone with another person's genitals, putting them at risk for an STD or unwanted pregnancy? What if you die as a toddler, do you still get to come back and fuck someone? Also, she says she doesn't want to go after her murderer while in the host, that's real fucking nice, Susie, the whole book's about you wishing you hadn't died and the strain it put on your family, and you'd rather take a dick in a bathtub then stop him from raping/killing more children. That's great. And that whole idea was a rip-off of the movie \"Ghost,\" remember? If you're gonna plagiarize from a Patrick Swayze movie, please make it \"Roadhouse.\"P.S. The real version of this book is called \"Remember Me\" by Christopher Pike which I read when I was ten."

        "user_review": "\"The Lovely Bones,\" had me crying from start to finish. This book is extremely emotion packed. But this book was interestingly written because it's from the point of view from a girl who was murdered. The book starts like this: \"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\" Already you want to read it; right? You follow the life that this young girl once had as she tells you about the memories she had, the things she learned, and the people she loved. Susie also talks about her \"heaven.\" In her heaven, Susie does not let her family and friends go. She follows them through the years, watching her younger sister Lindsey does everything that she would have done if she was alive. Susie can't let her family go, and they see her everywhere; in the valley where she was killed; in her fathers work room. It makes you value your family when you read about the devastation they were left with. I especially was sympathetic for her father. Through out the book you can see how difficult it was for him to realize and begin to let go of the fact that his first born had been killed. It's hard to imagine losing a child, but from reading this book I've begun to realize that it's a kind of sorrow that can only be felt by a parent. If you are in the mood for reading a depressing story then this book is definitely for you.The diction that Alice Sebold uses creates clear visuals in my head of what it was that Susie saw, and what she felt like being dead. You invision her family members and the environment that Susie had once been in. Another things that made me like this book so much was the fact that there were details that were used to help describe Susie that were also about me. A simple once was the fact that she was reading Othello in school. The use of details to develope the characters are very well done by Alice Sebold."

        "user_review": "Reviewed by Cana Rensberger for TeensReadToo.comTHE LOVELY BONES will haunt you. This book tells the story of the most horrific thing a family could ever endure, the murder of a loved one, a child.The child is 14-year-old Susie Salmon. We see the murder through her eyes, after she is killed. Susie narrates her story from heaven, a place like I'd not before imagined. Her heaven begins as her school playground. Slowly it grows to become more. Susie merely longs for something she misses from earth, and it appears, except, of course, the living. Although she can watch her loved ones, know what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, she cannot be with them, or they with her.The book begins with the emotional, frightening, and vividly shown homicide. Through Susie's eyes, we understand how he tricked her. We feel her terror as we realize, with her, what's about to happen. Then the scene moves to another, equally heartbreaking moment, three days later when a neighbor's dog finds a body part.You would think, at this point, that you wouldn't be able to read further, that you'd close the book and never reopen it. But you won't be able to. Like Susie, we want to know her family will be okay. We want to know the killer won't get away with it. The author, Alice Sebold, artfully forces you to read on.Susie watches her friends whisper about her at school. She watches as her younger sister, Lindsey, hardens to stone. Her four-year-old brother, Buckley, is passed from neighbor to neighbor, having sleepovers, told his sister has just gone away for a bit. She listens to the detective, Len, tell her parents the inevitable, that they are now investigating her disappearance as a murder. Her family slowly begins to crumble and Susie can do nothing to help.This sounds like a suffocating, depressing book, but as you read you'll feel encouraged as Susie's family begins to move on, never to forget, but to begin to live life without her. Buckley struggles to understand the meaning of forever. Susie's dad becomes obsessed with proving he's not crazy, that he's certain who killed his daughter. Susie's mom handles the stress by hiding from it. And Lindsey, known as the girl whose sister was murdered, strives to find herself again. She searches for love. And she takes a huge risk to help her dad flush out the killer.The ending is incredibly sweet. Amazing as it may seem, you will feel Susie's joy as she lets go of those she's left behind. For me, the ending wasn't perfect, it left me wanting, but I imagine that was deliberate. Life itself is not perfect. But life has hope. And that's the feeling that will stay with you as you turn the last page. It's a memorable read, not for the faint of heart. Expect to feel. To fear, to cry, and, yes, to laugh. THE LOVELY BONES will touch the very core of your being. Alice Sebold has written beautifully of the ugliest scenario possible. Wow."

        "user_review": "Well that wasn't a happy happy good time...The Lovely Bonesis going to be difficult to review without spoilers, so if you haven't read it yet I'm gonna have to go ahead and ask you to leave, m'kay?Why am I not surprised to learn that Alice Sebold was raped at a young age? Because only someone who'd been through something as horrific as that would write a book like this. I'm not just talking about the subject matter, but rather the tone. Everything about this book is a victim's silent scream. Suzie, the dad, the surviving kids...it seems like everyone has someone taken from them. Maybe even the mom. I mean after all, the life she wished to lead was raped from her after she had the chance to lead it.Honestly, I thought this was going to be even more depressing than it turned out to be. There's an unexpected hopeful strain through out, a nice pairing with some of Sebold's better writing.On the other hand, some of her writing is irritating. Most notably were the many instances in which she attempts to utilize suspense writer techniques. As readers we are expecting a divulgence of information regarding the focal murder of the story. So, it's a big old tease when Sebold abruptly states \"I saw him.\" Many times out of the blue she starts a new paragraph or section with just such a line and then goes on to talk about the family dog or some other nonsense. It's bullshit.Overall though, this isn't bad. At times I enjoyed this look (maybe not the POV from which the story's told) at the after affects of a young girl's mysterious murder. The grieving period for family and friends, and the various paths each of them takes, is portrayed with authenticity. Some grieve harder than others. This isn't a murder mystery, this is real life. It's not always interesting or entertaining. Sometimes it's just sad and thought provoking.So yes, I did likeThe Lovely Bones, but as for my tepid 3-star rating, all I can say is, Oprah lied. She told millions to read this and their perseverance upon that endeavor eventually got me to do the same. I read it. I was not Oprah-amazed. Why blame her? Because if she hadn't kicked it all off with her recommendation, I never would've read this. It's just not in my wheelhouse. Thus, I never would've had the opportunity to give this a lower rating. So, if you feel 3 stars is too low, blame Oprah."

Susie follows the lives of her family and friends as they struggle to cope with the aftermath of her death. In watching her family on Earth, Susie's journey to understanding the life she was robbed of becomes the central idea in the extraordinary novel \"The Lovely Bones\" by Alice Sebold. \"The Lovely Bones\" evokes joy and sorrow in its reader, making the whole reading experience worthwhile.Alice Sebold delivers originality in her novel by creating a heart-warming story told from the fresh point of view of a young girl in heaven. The novel begins with the protagonist, Susie Salmon, already in heaven. Most novels do not start by introducing a central character that is deceased before the story unfolds, but \"The Lovely Bones\" begins with the main character saying, \"My name was Susie Salmon […] I was fourteen when I was murdered […]\" (Sebold 1). The most interesting aspect of the novel is the point of view from which the story is told. The point of view also plays a significant role in the novel. Even though the main character, Susie, is dead, she still manages to evolve throughout the novel, therefore being dynamic. As Susie watches her family from heaven, she matures with them and experiences life by observing. The idea that life continues after death is the central theme of the novel. After the protagonist dies, she manages to stay in touch with her family by appearing at certain moments, almost like a ghost. Susie lets her family and friends know that the dead are here \"All the time. You can talk to us and think about us\" (Sebold 309). A connection between the living and the dead is established throughout the novel, which ties into the central theme. Eventually, through this connection, Susie and her family gain a better understanding of the love, life, and unfortunate circumstances that often tie people together in the world.Apart from the viewpoint, Sebold's writing style adds to the fresh appeal of the novel by contributing vivid descriptions of the setting and characters. In the novel, heaven is said to be different for each character. Susie and other deceased people \"Had been given, in our heavens, our simplest dreams. There were no teachers in the school. Our textbooks were Seventeen and Glamour and Vogue\" (Sebold 18). Sebold depicts heaven as a young child would depict a colorful candy store. Because Susie is only fourteen when she dies, the novel uses language and ideas that most teenagers would use. However, as the novel progresses, Susie's thoughts and opinions seem to mature, almost like those of her family and friends on Earth. Just as she would have on Earth, Susie learns that life must continue, even when it seems as if it is the end of the world.\"The Lovely Bones\" offers a new outlook on life, death and the journey in between. It sheds new light on the importance of family and the magnitude of love by focusing on a road to recovery after tragedy occurs. The novel leaves the reader feeling as if they have gained insight, but it also leaves the reader feeling empty once there are no more pages left to turn. Alice Sebold demonstrates originality by seamlessly connecting the living and the dead in her rightfully acclaimed novel. \"The Lovely Bones\" gives reason to believe that life does not have to end when death takes hold."

A very fast-paced story that involved a man's family into conflict once he found a precious item that could solve all his problems but that item only ended up creating new ones. And Steinbeck's writing is always emotional and I think most people who take the time to read this story will enjoy it. If you are looking for a short story about family and hardships, would recommend you reading this one.It is not good to want a thing too much. It sometimes drives the luck away. You must want it just enough, and you must be very tactful with Gods or the gods.Interesting story."

        "user_review": "Steinbeck does it again. All my experiences with his writings have been fantastic. Every word, every description, every plot point, every twist - perfect!The Pearl is very short but very amazing. It is a tale of greed and how people around wealth or who come upon sudden wealth are affected. Many of us think our life would be perfect if we won the lottery, but I think all of us could benefit from the lessons in this story.I picked this book now because I am on vacation in Hatteras, NC, and the locations along the sea seemed like they would blend well with my surroundings. I was correct! Many key scenes occur at or in the ocean, and reading this while my toes were in the surf added so much to the atmosphere.Do yourself a favor and take a quiet afternoon, get away to somewhere (a beach if possible), and read The Pearl. Your literary senses will thank you!"

        "user_review": "John Steinbeck's chilling novella The Pearl is the short story selection in the group catching up on classics for January 2017. In his retelling of a Mexican folktale, Steinbeck tells the tale of a fisherman named Kino who finds the pearl of the world on one of his dives. Showing how money is the root of all evil, Steinbeck delivers a poignant tale.First published in 1945, The Pearl is the story of Kino, Juana, and their baby Coyotito who one day discover a giant pearl on one of their fishing expeditions. All of a sudden, their entire village measures time against when Kino found his pearl. Even though fish and pearls are the source of Kino's livelihood each member of the village desires part of his newfound wealth. Rather than congratulating him on his prized discovery, each villager offers their unique suggestion as to how Kino should spend his winnings.Tragedy strikes. Coyotito is bitten by a scorpion, and Kino and Juana rush to town in attempt to persuade the doctor to treat their child. In a situation permeated with racism, the doctor of Spanish descent refuses to treat the apparent Native American Kino unless he comes up with substantial monetary payment. The only item of value that Kino possesses is the pearl, and he assures the doctor that he will be rewarded once the pearl given to brokers.Just like the doctors, the pearl brokers attempt to swindle Kino. Even though Kino has large dreams of what to do with his money, tragedies continue to befall him throughout the novella. Juana urges him to rid himself of this object that is clearly an agent of the devil. Through this folk tale, Steinbeck conveys that money is the root of all evils in the world. Underlying is a message of socialism, which was the world's response to the fascist dictators defeated in World War II.Although Steinbeck's skills as a master storyteller are evident in this novella, The Pearl does not resonate with me the way it does with others. At first I was elated that a poor villager found a jewel that could turn his life around only to see him face tragic tests. A literary masterpiece that should be read nonetheless, I rate The Pearl 4 stars- 5 for Steinbeck's prose and story telling skills, and 2.5-3 for a story that does not captivate me enough as perhaps it should."

        "user_review": "'For it is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more.'I love short Steinbeck novels. They tend towards brevity while being profuse in beauty, often written in idyllic tones that contrast with the darkness inside them.The Pearlis such a novel, a condensed tale warning against greed and materialism and a critical look at colonialism that is quite deeply moving. When a poor pearl diver discovers a giant pearl, dubbed the Pearl of the World, he thinks his luck is about to change. However, the innocence of his life becomes marred as finds that great wealth does not beget happiness but rather greed and sorrow as he must constantly defend his wealth. It becomes a parable of sorts, one that reminds us how often our possessions come to possess us and not the other way around.'Luck, you see, brings bitter friends,'Originally began as a movie script, Steinbeck published this as a short story under the titleThe Pearl of the Worldin 1944 before expanding it to the novella length a few years later. Perhaps from that, there is a cinematic quality to the narrative here that really pulls you along. Set on the coast of the Gulf of California, which Steinbeck would later write about inThe Log from the Sea of Cortezdetailing a 1940 expedition with his friend, marine biologist Ed Ricketts (who is the basis for Doc inCannery Row), Steinbeck is at home in his themes of good natured people living in poverty and the gatekeeping of society that ensures they stay this way. In many ways,The Pearlcan be read as a parable of colonialism or how for the poor and colonized any attempt to rise above their status is swiftly, and often violently, dealt with. When Kino has possession of the pearl and upward mobility, the plans and evils of men conspire to take it from him and we see how his poverty of spirit would be required for the wealth of materialism (something later expanded upon inThe Winter of Our Discontent).'If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.'This book has all the elements of a great tale, one that feels much older than it actually is, as if it has been a moral parable passed down for generations. There is the whole man vs nature with the scorpion attack at the beginning, man vs man with the people coming to take the pearl away, and man vs himself as Kino's ambitions become an increased zeal to obtain wealth from the pearl. Calling it the Pearl of the World initially seems a commentary on it's great size, but as the story progresses we see how it is much more abstract than that and a commentary on the universal nature of greed and violence in the name of wealth. Steinbeck does well to keep everything pointed and direct, but still vague enough to feel like a moral lesson that can be applied in many ways. The ending leaves much open and I sort of love that.This is a nice little book, rather devastating as short Steinbeck's tend to be, but quite powerful and beautiful all the same. I read this originally back as a high school freshman and this is a good one for a classroom.3.75/5"

        "user_review": "‭The Pearl, John Ernst SteinbeckThe Pearl is a novella by American author John Steinbeck, first published in 1947.It is the story of a pearl diver, Kino, and explores man's nature as well as greed, defiance of societal norms, and evil.Steinbeck's inspiration was a Mexican folk tale from La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, which he had heard in a visit to the formerly pearl-rich region in 1940.In 1947, it was adapted into a Mexican film named La perla and in 1987 into a cult Kannada movie Ondu Muttina Kathe.The story is one of Steinbeck's most popular books and has been widely used in high school classes.The Pearl is sometimes considered a parable. When Coyotito, an infant, is stung by a scorpion, Kino, his father, must find a way to pay the town doctor to treat him.The doctor denies Kino, an indigenous fisherman, out of racism, which enrages him. Shortly thereafter, Kino discovers an enormous, lucid pearl which he is ready to sell to pay the doctor.Everyone calls it \"the Pearl of the World,\" and many people begin to covet it. That very night Kino is attacked in his own home.Determined to get rid of the pearl, the following morning he takes it to the pearl auction in town; however, the auction is actually a corrupt sham and always has been.The buyers normally fake auction each pearl and pretend bid against each other, but in reality they are all paid a salary by a single man, they all turn the pearls over to him and he resells them outside the village, thus cheating the locals.The corrupt pearl buyers try to convince Kino that the pearl is the equivalent of \"fool's gold\" and they refuse to pay any more than incredibly low amounts of money.Kino decides to go over the mountains to the capital to find a better price. Juana, Kino's wife, sees that the pearl brings darkness and greed, and sneaks out of the house late at night to throw it back into the ocean. When Kino catches her, he furiously attacks her and leaves her on the beach. ...Characters:Kino, Juana, Coyotito, Juan Tomas, Apoloniaتاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه اکتبر سال1974میلادیعنوان: مروارید؛ اثر: جان اشتاین بک؛ مترجم: محمدجعفر محجوب؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر آرمان، چاپ چهارم سال1349، در203ص، چاپ پنجم سال1353؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20مداستان یک «مکزیکی» فقیر است، که بزرگ‌ترین «مروارید» دنیا را می‌یابد، و در دل، آرزوی خوشبختی خانواده‌ خویش را دارد؛ اما گنج، ارمغانی جز نابودی آنها ندارد؛شخصیت‌ها: («کینو»، شخصیتی مغرور و غواصی فقیر، «جوآنا» همسر «کینو» شخصیتی اندیشمند، که نشانه‌ های هشدار را که «کینو» از پذیرفتن آنها خودداری می‌کند، می‌بیند؛ و به خاطر وفاداری، و فرمانبرداری دیرینه از همسر، یارای دیگر کردن آنها را ندارد؛ «کویوتیتو»، پسربچه «کینو» و «جوآنا»، که در آغاز داستان، عقربی او را نیش می‌زند؛ «جوآن توماس»، برادر «کینو»؛ «دکتر»، شخصیتی که فاقد ارزش‌های اخلاقی است؛ او از درمان «کویوتیتو»، تنها برای اینکه، آنها پولی ندارند، سر باز می‌زند؛ اما پس از شنیدن خبر یافتن گنجی گرانبها، توسط «کینو»، خود جهت درمان بچه، به خانه ی آنها می‌رود)»؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 25/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

His under the mangroves flimsy brush house has three inside the pearl diver, his wife Juana not official, their first an only child a son the baby Coyotito he loves his family and the neighbors an uneducated superstitious group, as destitute as he yet a great generous \"tribe\" who have been exploited for 400 years by the European conquerors. A tragic almost fatal occurrence happens and the very concerned parents go on a desperate quest to see the only local doctor a rare visit, they know his reputation a racist that considers the indigenous animals, doesn't work for free will he treat their much cherished boy ? The whole neighborhood follows including his older brother Juan Tomas and wife Apolonia, it is quite a sight the whole town stares at the procession mesmerized by the strange parade of the impoverished in the early morning light...Arriving and the expected no money no medicine, so the couple comes back home and pray for the best to Jesus or the gods, Juana does both. Life must continue however Kino and Juana push their old much repaired canoe that was his grandfather's into the calm, warm green gulf waters swiftly jump in and paddle vigorously until they reach the pearl beds below...Kino can stay under for two minutes, he has a knife for prying open the oysters and two ropes one attached to a basket for the would be precious mineral and the other a rock to send the skilled diver to the bottom of the ocean quickly...It will change the way people treat the poor Indian , later his astounded friends will call it,The Pearl of the World a huge iridescent object as big as a seagull's egg men have killed for less, they try to cheat Kino , steal, deceive destroy his whole family he must leave and seek a honest person to buy the pearl in a large city, Coyotito needs to go to school be baptized, fine clothes for Juana get married in the Church a rifle for himself, away from the evil surrounding him the happy songs will not be sung , the little family walks away into an uncertain destiny the black night grows thicker, and the evil will follow...John Steinbeck's wonderful fable, simple in plot with a few characters involved in the story yet they are enough to articulate his views of the corruption of the individual when avarice consumes a man's soul and the endless cruelty inflicted on others to achieve his unsavory goal... sad but true."

        "user_review": "Overall, it's just not very good. I keep debating whether I should rate it one star or two, but ultimately the Goodreads definition of the two-star rating, \"it was ok,\" pushes me over the edge. It wasn't ok; nothing about this was ok.The writing style is bad, though I haven't read enough Steinbeck to know whether his stilted, awkward prose is just an affectation for this work (in an insulting attempt to illustrate that his main characters are poorly educated), or whether he is just always like this.His treatment of his characters is truly awful. Steinbeck strikes me as the worst kind of liberal; he's full of compassion for the circumstances of his characters, but that compassion never rises above the level that any of us would have for a sick animal. At least in this work, he seems like the kind of person who loves the poor, but only for the fact that they're poor. In short, he doesn't seem to think of his characters as people, just creatures buffeted by terrible circumstances.And the moral of the story is nearly reprehensible, to the extent that it makes any sense. The reason bad things are happening to these poor creatures? They wanted a better life. Steinbeck seems to be saying, \"don't try to do anything to improve yourselves, and you certainly should never dream. Be satisfied with where you are, because trying only leads to failure.\" If his moral were something like \"money doesn't bring happiness\" it would be fine, but this is more insidious, because he never even gives his characters the option of being poor and happy. His choice is a stark \"poor and miserable\" or \"poorer and more miserable.\" I can just see Steinbeck rewriting the Horatio Alger stories: a sad, poor boy tries to pull himself up by his bootstraps, but the bootstraps snap, and he falls off a cliff, breaks his neck at the bottom, and his corpse is eaten by syphilitic bears.If you like heavy-handed stories with a poor moral sense and bad writing... you can still do better than \"The Pearl.\""

        "user_review": "\"It was a morning like other mornings and yet perfect among mornings.\"This novella opens with the simple contentment of a young Mexican pearlfisher: at peace with his life, wife, and baby, living in a tightknit community, and accompanied by the \"Song of the Family\" that plays in his mind.Pearls, by contrast, are a consequence ofimperfection - possibly of pain or discomfort. But from the irritation caused by stray sand, rare transfixing beauty can occur. Unlike gold and diamonds, a pearl needs no finishing, and yet its allure arises from its imperfections: the shifting elusiveness of the watery light it exudes, the unexpectedly grainy surface, the not-quite spherical shape, and the glowing warmth it imparts to eye and skin.Be Careful What You Wish ForQuiet contentment would not make much of a story. But wherein lies the greater danger: a scorpion, poised to pounce on a resting babe, or a huge pearl that could pay for school, and thus enable little Coyotito to \"break out of the pot that holds us in\"?There is mystical hope when \"the need was great and the desire was great\", but beware, \"It is not good to want a thing too much.\"Oyster being opened, sourcehere.Fortune shines. \"In the surface of the great pearl he could see dreams forming.\"Fortune is fickle. \"The pearl has become my soul\". Wealth brings power, and power tends to corrupt. What once offered warm lucent promise turns \"gray and ulcerous\".The possession possesses him.Ultimately, this is a story of sacrifice - specifically, of choosing what and when to surrender. Make the wrong choice, and you risk losing everything.Story in SongThe people of the Gulf of California had songs for everything, though maybe only Kino hears them now. The story is encapsulated in the evolving sequence of songs (minor spoilers implied):* \"Clear and soft… The Song of the Family.\"* \"The Song of Evil… a savage, secret, dangerous melody, and underneath, the Song of the Family cried plaintively.\"* \"A secret little inner song… sweet and secret and clinging, almost hiding in the counter-melody, and this was the Song of the Pearl That Might Be.\"* \"The music of the pearl had merged with the music of the family so that one beautified the other.\"* \"The music of evil, of the enemy sounded, but it was faint and weak.\"* \"The music of the pearl was triumphant… and the quiet melody of the family underlay it.\"* \"The music of the pearl had become sinister… and it was interwoven with the music of evil.\"* \"The Song of the Family had become as fierce and sharp and feline as the snarl of a female puma.\"* \"The Song of the Family was as fierce as a cry… a battle cry.\"* \"The music of the pearl, distorted and insane.\"* \"The music of the pearl drifted to a whisper and disappeared.\"Faith… in What?Kino and Juana blend belief systems: ancient magic invocations, Hail Marys and prayers, and a resentful faith in the knowledge and consequent power of white settlers. A traditional remedy might be as effective as one from the doctor, but \"lacked his authority because it was simple and didn't cost anything.\"For those raised on Bible stories, it's impossible to read this without thinking of the pearl of great price, the desire for which Jesus likened to the Kingdom of Heaven:\"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.\" Matthew 13:45 - 46 (KJV)But it's an oft-misquoted proverb that comes more sadly and strongly to mind:\"For theloveof money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" 1 Timothy 6:10 (KJV)For the mere prospect of great wealth changes priorities, changes people - for ever. Transfiguration is not always for the better.And the Moral Is...Unlike a traditional parable or morality tale, there is no explicit teaching point, not even a clear ending. Just a new, stark, and very uncertain beginning.\"Oyster Pearl,\" Hawaii, by Anna. Licensed under CC By 2.0.Steinbeck's PhilosophySteinbeck distanced himself from Christianity over the years, and atheists sometimes claim him as their own. The Bible was certainly part of his heritage, but broader, non-sectarian social justice permeates his works.Of particular relevance to this novella:* Steinbeck grew up in California, and was always interested in Mexican culture around him.* His concern for the poor and marginalised is reflected in his writings.* He was shocked by race riots in his easygoing state, and wrote this two years later.* He was also reeling from the success and infamy of Grapes of Wrath.* This was written with the intention of its being filmed for and by Mexicans. And it was.* Steinbeck studied marine biology at university (but didn't complete the course).Quotes* \"The uncertain air that magnified some things and blotted out others… so that all sights were unreal and vision could not be trusted.\"* \"There is no almsgiver in the world like a poor man who is suddenly lucky.\"* \"So lovely it was, so soft, and its own music came from it - its music of promise and delight, its guarantee of the future, of comfort, of security. Its warm lucence promised a poultice against illness and a wall against insult. It closed a door on hunger.\"* \"The sky was brushed clean by the wind and the stars were cold in a black sky.\"* \"The land was waterless, furred by the cacti.\"* In the desert, \"pools were places of life because of the water, and places of killing because of the water, too.\"* \"He had lost one world and had not gained another.\"Neil Gaiman's take on PearlsIn American Gods, Gaiman says we insulate ourselves from the tragedies of others: \"we build a shell around it like an oyster dealing with a painful particle of grit...

They can barely scratch together enough to feed themselves, but what they lack is made up for with love.When a scorpion stings their baby, and they can't afford to pay a doctor, Kino and his wife desperately launch their canoe, searching for that elusive pearl which could mean the difference between life and death.There is something to be said for the art in simplicity. Steinbeck's scant-yet-beautiful writing style painted a vibrant picture of this family and their journey. I was wholly invested from the beginning.I readThe Pearl, a novella, in the space of a few hours. Its symbolic message led me to consider the meaning of true wealth and the price we pay to capture our own 'pearls.'If you haven't read it, I highly recommend this thought-provoking tale."

Nonetheless, there is a common denominator in the American author's charming writing: the story is always rooted in the orality of the tales and legends that the ancients transmit over time to new generations so that they never forget they came. Here he is inspired by a traditional Mexican story.This little parable can be read in one go, as the writing is rich and limpid. The themes dear to the author and familiar to many of these novels are still omnipresent.Steinbeck portrays misery to raise awareness of unhappy lives, but above all, he denounces pearl fishers' living conditions, exploited and enslaved by the merchants of precious stones.He denounces protests repeatedly against the social divide and the painful and hopeless misery it generates.What brings life to life are dreams and flourishing imagination. But the goals of the poor are systematically trampled on by the most powerful.Despite a realistic but very pessimistic vision of society, all of Steinbeck's finesse illuminates The Pearl, whose melancholic music had permanently embedded in my memory."

Una historia sencilla, narrada en forma clara, sin rodeos ni términos difíciles. Steinbeck logra atraparme siempre con sus libros. Al igual que como con \"De Ratones y Hombres\", \"La Perla\" nos muestra una historia en donde apreciamos la naturaleza humana al desnudo, las emociones a flor de piel en situaciones límites.No he leído \"Las Uvas de la Ira\" ni \"Al Este del Edén\", pero siento que Steinbeck es poderoso en este tipo de novelas cortas. En este libro todo gira alrededor de esa perla, cuya \"canción\", como él la denomina, comienza a infectar el alma de Kino.Ese pescador afortunado (¿afortunado?) por el descubrimiento de la gema que busca la felicidad a partir de él. Kino y Juana junto con Coyotito emprenden una travesía al estilo Sam y Frodo con una perla en vez de un anillo, pero no hacen falta 700 interminables páginas para describir la travesía, no hace falta describir enredos agotadores para lograr un efecto maravilloso en el lector.Tan sólo un objeto, una perla, que nos pregunta a todos, al narrador, los personajes y al lector: ¿tú, qué harías ante una oportunidad así?Para Kino es una bendición, para Juana, una maldición y para nosotros, los lectores, una maravillosa historia."

        "user_review": "This is a deceptively simple Mexican fable. It's written by Steinbeck, so of course, it's written beautifully. The story is pretty straightforward--poor, uneducated peasant finds monster pearl and now has everything previously denied to him within his grasp. Or does he?*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Kino is happy despite his poverty and his low position on the social scale. He and the other natives in his village are under the control of the wealthy Spanish people who have taken up residence in the nicer part of town. The wealthy Spanish people live comfortably in their brick and plaster houses, exercising an iron control over the laws and economics of the town, while Kino and his ilk live in brush huts. Kino, however, is happily married to Juana, and they are both content in their relationship and with their beloved first-born son, Coyotito. The serpent enters their tropical Eden in the form of a scorpion that stings the baby--a possible death sentence. When the Spanish doctor refuses to treat him because of their poverty, Kino goes pearl-diving, laboring under tremendous emotional agony. He finds a large, obviously old oyster, and it yields a magnificent pearl--the pearl of the world. It is at this moment, when Fate drops a fortune into Kino's hands, that his real troubles begin.Okay, so as we follow Kino through the increasing complexity of the problems that develop as a result of his ownership of this pearl, many issues are raised. What, exactly, is Steinbeck saying? The old adage, \"Be careful what you wish for,\" comes to mind, and is certainly apropos. I have read that some see this as a critique of capitalism and the American Dream. Certainly Kino seems to have achieved the American Dream when that pearl drops into his hand. But that dream, his good fortune, is ruthlessly hunted and destroyed, piece by piece, by faceless individuals who could be anyone--his friends, his neighbors, or the greedy members of the wealthy community. So Steinbeck could be saying that the American Dream is a myth, that the system is stacked against those who need it the most. What about capitalism? Under the principles of capitalism, Kino should have been rewarded for bringing such a rare, desirable object into the marketplace. Instead, it is treated with contempt by those who should have been most interested in acquiring it. In reality, true capitalism was never really at play. There was no competition; the market was controlled by one person. So is Steinbeck saying that capitalism, too, is a myth? That human corruption will always interfere with the free and unimpeded flow of the marketplace?Greed is condemned in all forms, and everyone seems to feel it. After the news of Kino's find circulates, various people all start calculating how his profits can personally affect them. The doctor belatedly hurries to the side of the baby, eager to charge exorbitant fees for his assistance; the priest begins to mull pressuring Kino to donate to the church for repairs; and even the town beggars begin to anticipate Kino's generosity to them. But is Kino guilty of greed, as well? Is he reaching for too much, demanding too much, of life? He is certainly punished for attempting to have more.I teach my students that in order to determine the themes of a text, you look at what happens to the main characters. By any interpretation, the themes of this story are bleak. Either Kino allows the pearl to give him delusions of grandeur that cause him to attempt to fly too close to the sun, and, like Icarus, tumble to his doom, or Kino is an example of how a poor, uneducated person has no chance of prevailing against the system and bettering his life in any way. Not only will he not be permitted to move up, but he will be severely punished for the attempt.I personally believe it is the latter theme that is best supported by the text, but I don't believe it is a true statement about the condition of the American Dream in our country today. While breaking free of poverty is difficult to do and is a complex issue, I do not believe that people attempting to do so are faced with certain defeat, as Kino was. Therearepeople who accomplish it, so it is doable.Steinbeck, like Charles Dickens, used his writing to fight fiercely for the rights of the poor and downtrodden, and I think that the enduring nature of their works is a testament to how very effective they were."

        "user_review": "The Pearlis Steinbeck's retelling of a Mexican folktale. With his beautiful writing, Steinbeck tells us the story of Kino, a poor pearl diver, whose simple and peaceful life changes, irrevocably, with the finding of the \"pearl of the world\". With the newfound riches, Kino dreams of making a better life for his family, educating his son, hoping he will uplift them from the class of \"outcasts\". But, fate or evil or greed or whatever you like to call it won't let Kino see the dawn of his dream. Instead, only tragedy follows in its wake.This tragic story is gloomy and depressing. My heart went to Kino and his family. At the same time, I was feeling angry at the injustice of it all. Kino only wants a better life for his family. But his efforts are thwarted at every corner. He is cheated, threatened, and persecuted just because he wanted to get a decent sum for his pearl so he could make a good living out of it.When I read a little into the background of this novella, I saw that one of the main themes is \"good and evil\". When interpreting the theme it can only be understood that Kino's former life, the simple life before the finding of the pearl, is \"good\" and the comfortable and better life that he hopes to have with new riches is \"evil\". With it goes that all is Kino's fault. It'shis greedthat has been his undoing. He mustn't have dared to rise in life, to aspire to reach higher status. But that cannot be right. Steinbeck couldn't have intended that. I think the story goes deeper. It is the society that is evil, and that \"evil society' persecutes the \"good Kino\" and his innocent dreams. Society is unhappy to see its pattern change. It doesn't want to see Kino and the likes rise from their \"given status\" to a higher one. And it's not so much of Kino's greed that brings him evil, but the social norms and attitudes. This bitter truth is simply shocking and disgusting.Although thematically interesting, the story didn't quite resonate with me. There was drama and excitement, and at times suspense, but, the overall storyline was thin and weak. Steinbeck usually rouses powerful emotions within me, but here, they weren't strong. However, Steinbeck's writing compensates for this deficiency. His magician's wand (by which I mean his pen) brings to life the setting, the landscape, and Kino's thoughts and emotions beautifully. I particularly enjoyed how he described Kino's mind with reference to music. It was wonderfully clever of him. I can quite honestly say that it was his beautiful writing that absorbed me more than the story. Overall, it is not the best of Steinbeck, but still, a good read."

        "user_review": "This is the first Steinbeck's book I've read, though it won't be the last, despite the horrible first impression. I hate everything in this book - from it's anticlimactic writing to its incommodious characters. There is nothing worth praise in here. After I reached the end, I've been so angry and almost ready to punch something.Poor low-class man, living with his wife and their baby, finds a giant pearl, decides to sell it and then use the money to buy medicine for his child, who just got bitten by a scorpion. The selling part didn't go well, shit gets real, people die without any real purpose and it all happens in about 90 pages. In between, there are large amounts of racism, bigotry, and misogyny.The reason bad things happen to this poor family is that they wanted a better life and the guy didn't want to let anyone stop him from getting it. Basically, his wife is superstitious, tells him the pearl is evil, he doesn't listen, so tragedy happens. Steinbeck is actually telling us to be satisfied with what we are and not try seeking better options because we're inevitably going to fail in the end. Also, he justifies when a husband beats his wife and she obediently suffers because HE'S A MAN AND HE KNOWS BEST. Maybe I should've tried more to read between lines but this was too much for me. Try and see it for yourself.The narrator literally has no personality, so I don't know how I'm supposed to empathize with any of his struggles. He had some abrupt reactions, but when it comes to recognizable emotions he's pretty blank. I hate it when I can't connect to the main characters or ANY of the characters. And their difficulties were severe."

Summoning songs of despair and songs of hope, soothing lullabies and wrathful incantations, this folkloric tale unfolds between oscillating paeans to love and hate, repression and freedom, good and evil and ponders about the thin line separating the power of dreams from blinding ambition.The ritualistic tradition of simply drawn characters and linear storytelling becomes even more distinctive in this novelette, in which Steinbeck's unpretentious lyricism blends with the gist of thought and spirit.A pearl of unparalleled beauty disrupts the life of a humble fisherman and his family and leads them to a fatal outcome following the style of classical tragedies. The impossibility of defeatingfatum, that adverse destiny that enslaves mankind with the manacles of greed and pride and nurtures self-destruction is the beguiling voice and true protagonist of the story.On this occasion, lethal music embodies what is common in John Steinbeck's books: a criticism of social injustices, a history built on rulers and subjugated, abuse and spoliation, illusion and treachery.But the dominating melody of the author's outspoken nonconformity is not what stayed with me after I turned the last page of this slim volume. For it is in the nacreous surface, in the seductive roundness of the pearl where the real dilemma arises.Is purity of beauty more deadly than the venom of a scorpion?Is man unworthy of divine exquisiteness?Can you hear the echo of deception that hides behind the mask of flawless perfection?Steinbeck did. And so he wrote a song to exorcise mankind's despair after realizing he can't capture the beauty of the world neither with melodies nor with poetry. It is only the reflection of his own shadows that he is after.\"If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.\"One can only hope for fleeting moments of bliss when the vertiginous currents of poetry wash away the mediocrity of existence and cruelty is smothered with tenderness and the song of doom is interrupted by the purity of silence.Can you hear it?Steinbeck could."

        "user_review": "\"It is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more.\"The Pearlis a moral allegory in narrative form; it is a revealing and instructional tale. At its very core, the novel establishes that wealth (in the form of a pearl) is not the answer to all our problems. In fact, it can create many more problems than it solves.When Kino finds the treasure, he dreams of the opportunities it can bring him. He wants to get married in a big fancy church and he wants to send his son to school. However, when he attempts to sell it, he finds himself cheated by merchants (who see him as a dumb uneducated animal) and the object of envy from his neighbors. He finds himself in a dangerous situation as he is targeted by thieves and those who would do him, and his family, harm just to get their hands on the pearl. Kino becomes obsessed with protecting it and protecting the dreams he thinks it can realize.Set against a backdrop of racial prejudice and a disparity of wealth and opportunity, the short work depicts the rural Mexican experience in the face of a modernizing world. Kino has more decency and respect for others, but often finds himself treated as lesser. He has better values, though for all his good intentions, he doesn't quite grasp the opportunistic nature of the world. Human greed and materialism are virtues many live by.The Pearlworks towards establishing how dangerous and foolish such virtues are.Overall, it is a very good novel with a powerful central motif. It is, however, somewhat vanilla, and unemotional in its narrative power. The story falls just short of greatness as it fails to capture the intensity of the human experience with its bland diction and expression. The characters don't really drive the story forward, the pearl does, and because of the brevity of the work they never really establish themselves or develop (until the reversal at the end.)Moreover, the novel lacks a certain sense of drive and plot. Compared to the complexities ofThe Grapes of Wrathit's a bit of a basic story. Indeed, the characters from ofOf Mice and Menare well crafted and deeply flawed individuals by comparison. The ones here don't quite have chance to shine. For me, this is very much a weak novel by a great writer who has done much better. It's certainly worth a read, but I feel it could be a much better price of writing.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________"

        "user_review": "There are a few novels I consider perfect andThe Pearlis one of them. Steinbeck's parable is a complex symbolic story told in simple poetic language. The symbolism is built up layer by layer, like an oyster coating a grain of sand, and the result is a flawless tale, smooth and clear, like the Pearl of the World.This is the story of the dawn of consciousness: The story human beings have been telling themselves since human beings started telling stories. The story of us, what we are, and how we came to be. The perennial story. Steinbeck tells it as well as the best of them.The Pearlis fable as poetry, fable as philosophy, like the story ofGenesis, like creation stories the world over, a fable that tells every story from Adam and Gilgamesh and Achilles to the Greatest Story Ever Told, the story we need to save us ~ if we will allow ourselves to be saved, to spit out the fruit, to give up the God-likeness that makes the origin story necessary in the first place.In the beginning, there is peace. La Paz. The little family lives in harmony with nature. Kino wakes up in the morning and hears the song of the family. He looks at the world around him. The crowing rooster. The rooting pigs. The waves lapping on the shore. The dog curled up at his feet. \"It was very good\" (1).\"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good\" (Genesis1:31).In his primitive idyll, Kino is both animal and God. Both less than human and more than human. He lives in an eternal present, like an animal, like God. He is whole. He has no ego. Consciousness has not yet emerged in Kino. He is not yet \"fallen.\" The songs that he hears are the nonlinear and nonverbal impressions that prefigure thought. Steinbeck's prelapsarian man is Julian Jaynes' bicameral man.In this preconscious paradise, Kino observes and understands without turning everything into a narrative. After his awakening, after consciousness dawns, he starts to tell himself a story: Coyotito will go to school. He and Juana will marry in the church. This story replaces his music. Thus begins the fall.Kino says each thing out loud and by doing so, he makes it real. For as all primitive people know, words are magical.\"And suddenly he was afraid of his talking\" (26).Kino is right to be afraid. He is already losing his \"deep participation with all things\" (55). The familiar sound of crickets, tree frogs, and toads has become a song of evil. He sees only his story now. He doesn't even see the dog at his feet. He is alone, like Jaynes' bicameral man when the voices of the gods were gone. And with the dawn of consciousness comes the expulsion from paradise. Kino and Juana \"went out into the world\" (68).Kino tries to return to animal innocence, but it is too late. There is no going back. He removes his clothing, replacing his white shirt with his brown skin, but to no avail. The apple cannot be unbitten. Man and consciousness are now joined as are Kino and his pearl.The only way out is through.Consciousness has overreached itself. God is dead and his absence,deus absconditus, is the fatal flaw (the Achilles' heel) of consciousness. It is time to go under ~ like Nietzsche's Zarathustra. To go under ~ into Freud's oceanic feeling. Maybe microdose the water supply. To go under and live as the rest of creation lives. Not without reason. Athens had reason. Not without faith. Israel had faith. But without discontent (to use Freud's word).All language began as poetry and all language must resolve into poetry. Pure symbolism. Blake understood this. Novalis understood this. I think Steinbeck understood this too."

I've decided to order them from my library and other sources and what ever shows up in my queue is what I read next. I just would not know what to select and want to read them all.Steinbeck's The Pearl was inspired by a Mexican folk tale he heard. It tells the story of Kino, his wife Juana, and their baby Coyotito. One day Coyotito is stung by a scorpion and Kino takes him to the dr for help. But the dr is greedy and doesn't think the payment is adequate and refuses to treat the child. Kino, a fisherman, goes to the ocean to find a pearl for payment and finds the pearl of the world. The biggest pearl that anyone has seen. And so begins this wonderful, heart breaking tale of determination, greed, evil, and family. You feel for Kino, he wants what he feel he is owed for this pearl, to make a better life for his son, but along the way becomes a different person. He becomes hunted by evil for this pearl.Oh I'm so glad I read this one, eh, listened to the audio narration. Again, another fabulous audio, this time done by Héctor Elizondo (who btw is in one my fav movies Frankie & Johnny). Love his voice and it was great to hear this story told, adding so much to it. It's very short, a little over 2 hrs in duration but such an unexpected treat. And now, I'm excited to see what shows up next in my library queue."

        "user_review": "When you're reading books like The Hate U Give, you're reading someone's decision against silence.This book has made me feel every single possible emotion at the same time. It was truly incredible and I have SO MUCH to say about it I wish I could actually just send everyone a howler containing the entire script of this book instead.\"What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\"In all honesty,The Hate U Givehas made me realize just how simply clueless I was as to the continuing day-to-day actuality of systemic racism in America. A reality in which on any given day, some innocent person likeTommy Lecan get shot hours before his high-school graduation because he was carryinga pen, or another innocent person likeSandra Blandcan get into a car, and then three days later she is going to end up dead in jail, ora five years old childcan get shot and wounded after the police kills his mother. A reality in which justice is dead and the police kills black youth with impunity.And so many other real stories I read about that truly made the atoms making up my body have enough of being anchored to this awful reality in this human form and wish to move on, become a light wave or something.See, I don'tknowwhat it's like to be black in America, but I have 18 years of experience in being a brown Muslim woman and I can tell you this: being in the minority is like being stuck behind a glass wall and whenever an injustice occurs, you breathe onto it and you write it in HUGE letters in the condensation...but nobody seems toreallysee it. Nobody seems to really seeyou. You're completely and utterlyalone.(x)The Hate U Giveis about institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system where the police can violate the civil rights of thousands of people publicly and openlywith almost no consequence at all.It's about what happens when racialized and marginalized communities stand up for their rights in any visible way whatsoever. It's about how piles and piles of evidence showing sustained corruption and racism and literally hundreds of civilian deaths per year at the hands of the police is still somehownotenough to delegitimize a deeply flawed system.It's about how instead of standing in unwavering solidarity with the non-violent protests by Black Lives Matter in the face of actually violent, overtly discriminatory and oftenfatalactions by the police and demanding societal redress and justice, there will always be people who will decry and get enraged by it, people who will try to justify those injustices byanymeans to curb their own cognitive dissonance.\"A hairbrush is not a gun.\"I mean, this is the 21st century. We evolved. America had elected its first black president. Humanity must've left 'racism' back up in the trees from the jungles we descended from.... right?Maybe there just aren't many \"social experiments\" on YouTube where privileged folks get to dress up like oppressed groups and have cameras following them around in order to find out that racism is real, since apparently you really need the personal account of a white non-Muslim girl who tries on a hijab for a weekto find out that racism and islamophobia do indeed exist,or a straight person pretending to be gay tofind out that homophobia does exist, or an able-bodied person pretending to be disabledto find out that ableism does exist.You don't need any \"social experiments\" to understand oppression. You don't need to plagiarize lived experiences when you can justlisten. Not to the personal accounts filtered through a white person butlistento the testimonials of all the people of color across the globe who experience these issues first hand - no matter what their socio-economic standing is, and who areignoredwhen they actually reach out to educate you even though they shouldn't even have to.No oneshould have to debate about whether or not they should have basic human rights.No oneshould be expected to be the mouth piece for an entire group.No oneshould have to defend their humanity at every single step, repeatedly and constantly.Butracism does exist.And I don't usually comment on other people's reviews, but if you've read this book and chose to ignore the important message it conveys to get offended over the main character's remark about the way white people call 'target'tar-jayand \"hey hey that's racist!\" because you think a harmless joke could possiblyequatethousands of black lives unjustly killed every year at the hands of the police, or say \"but what if it was the other way around?\" when you havezero concept of power dynamics and historical context,you are missing the point.Now you can justify youroutrageby bringing up the definition of racism like I've seen so many people do, but I don't think dictionary definitions will help you there when they are the most basic forms of words and often can't even be taken in a sociological sense.Just like how they won't help with the usual cries of 'reverse racism' or even the moronic nonsense like trying to claim that anti-Islamic bigotry is not racist because \"Islam is not a race\".It won't change the fact that members of marginalized groups suffer under the yoke of all forms of social inequality, from racism to misogyny to ableism to so much moreon a daily basis.It won't change the fact that these words are a constant, inevitable factors of the lives of the minority,allfound on different levels of existence,allcarrying various levels of trauma.I thinkScott Woodssaid it best when he said that racism is bigger than just \"conscious hate\". That it might look likehatebut it is just one manifestation. And privilege is another. Access is another. Ignorance is another.Apathyis another.\"You can destroy wood and brick, but you can't destroy a movement.\"Khalil's story is one I will never forget, just like I won't forget all therealstories this book has opened my eyes to.(x)☆ko-fi★blog☆twitter★tumblr☆"

        "user_review": "The truth casts a shadow over the kitchen—people like us in situations like this become hashtags, but they rarely get justice. I think we all wait for that one time though, that one time when it ends right.Maybe this can be it.There are those books that are important and timely, worthy of reading because of the social and/or political message that they send. They fill a gap in the market; they make waves. They need to exist. And there are other books that are well-written, emotionally-charged and unputdownable - books that are notimportantas such, just really fucking good. But, on occasion, you find one of those rare wonderful creatures that is both important AND really fucking good.The Hate U Giveis one of those books.I could tell you that this book is inspired by the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. I could tell you that it rips unapolegetically into a subject that needed to be ripped into - the shootings of unarmed black people by police officers, as well as racial bias in the justice system. I could tell you that it opened my eyes to aspects of white privilege I never considered. All of that needs to be said, for sure, but I feel like I'm doing this book a disservice by highlighting its sociopolitical importance over the fact that it's also afantastic, powerful and utterly unforgettable book.I don't know what your experiences were as a child, but when I was young, I remember my parents giving me a talk about how if I was ever lost or in trouble, I should look for a police officer. They would protect me, look after me, and make sure I got back to my parents unharmed. They are the people in society we should be able to trust. But the black protagonist of this book - Starr - gets a very different talk. About how to behave around police officers so she doesn't get arrested. Or shot.Unfortunately, her friend - Khalil - never got that talk.I've seen it happen over and over again: a black person gets killed just for being black, and all hell breaks loose. I've Tweeted RIP hashtags, reblogged pictures on Tumblr, and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down.Now I am that person, and I'm too afraid to speak.The Hate U Giveis about how Starr deals with the aftermath of witnessing Khalil being shot by a cop for... doing absolutely nothing wrong. Her fear is palpable as she confronts a system that she knows is working against her. She's afraid to speak out, yet angry that Khalil's murderer could escape justice. We see, through Starr's eyes, how the media presents young black men as guilty until proven innocent - and when you're poor, black, and from a rough neighborhood, it's virtually impossible to appear innocent.Though, at its heart, this book first and foremost captures the perspective of a scared young girl. A girl with a loving family, complicated friendships with white teenagers at her school, and a white boyfriend. The relationship dynamics run alongside the fight for justice and are no less compelling. Thomas deftly portrays complex, nuanced relationships between all the people in the book, considering the divides between Starr and her white classmates, but never allowing anyone to become cliche or one-dimensional.Little humorous gems lay scattered throughout the dialogue:Momma reaches her fork onto my plate and breaks off a piece of pancake. \"What is Tumblr anyway? Is it like Facebook?\"\"No, and you're forbidden to get one. No parents allowed. You guys already took over Facebook.\"\"You haven't responded to my friend request yet.\"\"I know.\"\"I need Candy Crush lives.\"\"That's why I'll never respond.\"It's incredible howThe Hate U Givemanages to both break your heart and warm it in the space of just a few pages.What else can I even say? If you want to have your heart ripped out - read this book. If you want to read a great book about a girl dealing with family and relationships - read this book. If you want to cry, laugh, and then cry some more - read this book. If you're ready to change this stupid fucking world - read this book.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube"

But I added it to my TBR pile and forgot about its existence.But here we are now.The Hate U Give.That stands for THUG, right? Well, it does because Tupac said so.The book revolves around Tupac's motto: THUG LIFE – The Hate U Give Little Infants F-s Everyone.It might sound too \"ghetto\" or it might sound completely bullshit. To some people. But it is actually deeper than ignorant people can handle. It is the rough way of saying that hate is given to people from infancy. This hate grows and evolves into something that can affect everyone. No one is safe when raised with hate. No one.\"I can't change where I come from or what I've been through, so why should I be ashamed of what makes me, me?\"Starr is only sixteen and she's already lost two of her best friends – one at ten and the other at sixteen. For the last one, she was the only witness at his brutal murder.From the outside, whatever happens in the hood is cruel and dangerous. People from the outside label those who live in the ghetto, but they never hear their backstories. No one cares about those backstories. And this is why Khalil's murder is not being validated. Because he's been labelled as a drug dealer, gang member…a young thug. And not as the boy who loved his Mama more than he loved himself. Or the boy who loves bubble baths. Or the boy who tried to sacrifice everything for his family.\"He was more than any bad decision he made.\"This is a book about standing straight in from of the unfairness of life and shouting for your freedom. It's about the racism, the violence, the abuse and the punishment some get and others don't.Now, I really want to say thatI love Starr's family.They annoy the hell out of each other but they love each other and they always put family first. They know how to protect one another and they are going to do so under any circumstance.Their love and affection for each other made my heart cry.Also, even though Nana wasn't really the best mum for her children when she was younger, she was a hell of a character throughout the book! Like for real, every passage of the book containing even the least reference to that woman made me laugh. She's hysterically sassy!And since we are here, Nana was also the one that said that when it rains while the sun's out, that means that the devil is beating his wife. Putting aside the domestic violence that this belief leads to (that I am really not approving of and I think it should be abolished), this is actually more of an accurate saying than we have in Romanian. Because, we also have this in Romanian (because we have a hell of an imagination and we somehow believe in everything the folklore says but also we don't, just because).Take every single child in Romania outside while is raining when the sun is out and they're going to tell you that it is \"cat's wedding\". What the bloody hell does that mean, we don't know, but that doesn't stop us from saying it.I am not looking for masterpieces in general when I read books. I don't think all books should be masterpieces. Some of them ought to be fun. Some ought to inspire. And that is the beauty of them all.Drawing now a line, I have decided that this book was not meant to be a literary masterpiece. No. It was created to raise awareness of various factors that are real and alive. And that I why I salute this book with almost 5 full stars. It's worth my stars because it was worth my time.\"Don't let them put words in your mouth. God gave you a brain. You don't need theirs.\"Speak up your mind. Dare to be you in a world everyone wants you to be something else. Find your voice to fight everything that doesn't seem right to you. Live life as you think you ought to, not as others dictate you to. Raise awareness."

        "user_review": "This is aMUST READfor 2017 releases.I absolutely adored this book. I truly don't feel like it has a single flaw. Every topic addressed was approach so wonderfully and did not hold back. If you're looking for a diverse read that stands out amongst most YA,The Hate U Giveis the book for you.I love Starr Carter so much. She's honestly such an inspiration to girls looking to find their voice. She is resilient, authentic, and everything we need in adolescents today. Although she is not completely fearless, she embraces the adversity in her way and stands against it. I don't know many people who could juggle the stresses in her life and come out weapons (in this case, words) blazing. Every moment in this book just filled me with pride for this girl and it was a pleasure being able to watch her grow.I also love the family dynamic in this book. I think it honestly might be the most healthy, realistic, close-knit family I've ever read in a YA. The siblings may tease each other, but they protect each other fiercely. The parents may not always get along, but they are head over heels in love. They always attempt to do what is best for their children, even if it may not be their own personal preference. It was so nice to have just a scene of a family sitting down to watch sports together, throwing a pool party, always working together. It is something I truly valued from this read.The strongest aspect of this book is it's social commentary and political criticism. This is the kind of book that should be in the hands of teens, making them aware of current issues, educating them on pressing matters, and encouraging them to get involved to create change. I absolutely left this read with an entirely new perspective I will carry with me in the future. It poses many important questions about racism, police brutality, discrimination, and prejudice while also answering them in a comprehensive and inviting way. It was fascinating to see the integration of such a powerful movement implemented into an accessible form of media for teens. I truly don't think you can leave this book without SOMETHING that will have made you say \"I never thought about it this way\", \"When you put it this way, that actually makes a lot of sense.\", and \"I'm glad someone finally told me this.\"Although this book is full of important moments related to the current state of marginalized populations, it is primarily about using your voice. I believe this book has the power to make readers realize just how much their words matter. Starr Carter is a perfect example of an individual who feels their voice does not matter but through courage, risk-taking, and ultimate strength, she realizes how crucial it is to speak up for what you are passionate about no matter how terrifying the consequences may seem. And I believe you will leave this book with that revelation as well.I cannot recommend this book enough. It's absolutely one of my favorite books of the year. I am so happyThe Hate U Giveexists, and I'm even more ecstatic that it is a 1! NYT best seller, out in to the world, ready to help teens realize how important they really are. Please pick up \"THUG\". You will not regret it."

Corporate America don't bring jobs to our communities, and they damn sure ain't quick to hire us. Then, even if you do have a high school diploma, so many schools in our neighbourhoods don't prepare us well enough. Our schools don't get the resources to equip you. It's easier to find some crack than it is to find a good school around here.Now think 'bout this. How did the drugs even get in our neighborhood? This is a multibillion-dollar industry. That shit is flown into our communities but I don't know anybody with a private jet.Drugs come from somewhere, and they're destroying our community.You got folks like Brenda, who think they need them to survive, and then you got the Khalils, who think they need to sell them to survive. The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean, and they can't pay for rehab unless they get jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs, they either spend most of their life in prison, another billion-dollar industry, or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start selling drugs again.That's the hate they're giving us, a system designed against us. That's Thug life.\"This book opened my eyes. I don't want to say too much, but I love how popular this book is, being No. 1 on the NYT bestseller list and already having cast Amandla Stenberg as the lead actress in the movie adaption. We need this, America needs this, YA fiction needs this. Angie Thomas gets so many things right, and so many readers can learn about Black culture, cultural appropriation, covert and internalized racism and so much more through this.Apart from that, this book is simplygood. It could be a biography, that's how realistic it feels. The characters have real depth, and honestly, it's so so hilarious. Doesn't matter if the characters are joking about books and fandoms or getting their butts whooped by their parents, it's laugh-out-loud material. The only thing is, I wasn't overly emotional while reading this. I didn't cry ugly tears, didn't have my heart broken like I did in TFIOS, despite the horror described in the book. But it's real and it's perfect.Find more of my books on Instagram"

It's not the plot, or prose, or characters that count, but the story itself. The sheer significance of the work negates any need to dwell on the details that tend to make a book what it is.This is the best example of that phenomenon I can think of.This is a story of unreal importance that came out exactly when it was needed and made its way into the hands of exactly the millions of people who would be most impacted by reading it. This is a story of unbearable suffering and injustice happening right now, and it was devoured by millions upon millions of young people.I can't wrap my mind around readers and reviews of this book who choose to get caught up in moments of uneven prose or slightly stilted characters. How could you decide to focus on such inanities considering everything that surrounds them?The Hate U Give examined one of the most important movements happening today, wrapped it up in a narrative, and gifted it to the young people of the world. That gift became one of the bestselling novels in recent memory.What could matter more than that?That's my bottom line.----------------pre-reviewnot even a tiny bit overhyped.review to come----------------tbr reviewme: oh my god i'm so happy the hate u give won the goodreads choice awardme: wait i haven't even read the hate u giveme: ...wait it's not even on my shelvesme:"

As a white reader, the experience this story affords its readers cannot be taken for granted. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this book takes you into the heart of Garden Heights after the main character has witnessed the wrongful murder of her best friend Khalil by a police officers. Being Canadian, as well as being white, I have the privilege of not having to deal with any of the things Starr deals with on a day to day basis but the experience of being alongside her as she grappled with the injustice of it all gave me a completely new understanding of what is going on in America. Canada has it's fair share of race issues as well and I obviously am not ignorant to it all, but this just felt like an honest firsthand account. It really is indescribable. This is such an important read and I highly encourage you to pick it up.I will do a full spoiler free review and spoiler discussion on my channel very soon."

        "user_review": "Wow. Just wow.In my life so far, I've had the opportunity to experience many different things, but there are certain things I'll never get/have to experience. For example, I'll never experience childbirth, not that I'm complaining, although I once had a cortisone shot in my hip flexor, and my orthopedist said she thought those hurt just as badly. (You can debate on that.)I'm also fortunate enough that I'll never have to worry about the police viewing me as a threat as soon as they see me, just because of the color of my skin. I'll never have to think about the possibility of a routine traffic stop turning into something more dangerous just because a policeman gets nervous. That's something I take for granted, but I won't now that I've read Angie Thomas' searing, powerfully movingThe Hate U Give.Starr is 16 years old. She feels like there are two of her—the devoted daughter who lives in a poor neighborhood and saw her best friend get killed in a drive-by shooting when they were 10, and the student at the fancy prep school her parents sent her and her brothers to in order to get them out of the ghetto, the student who doesn't speak the way she does at home, and lets very few people into her \"real world.\" Even her boyfriend at school, Chris, with whom she watches reruns ofThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airdoesn't know the \"real\" Starr, although he says he wants to.\"Funny how it works with white kids though. It's dope to be black until it's hard to be black.\"One night while Starr is at a party in her neighborhood, she runs into her childhood friend Khalil. Khalil was her first crush, and although she hasn't seen him for a while, it feels good to reconnect. When a fight breaks out at the party, the two leave before things get out of hand. Not long afterward, police pull Khalil's car over, and before they know it, Khalil gets shot and killed by the cop. He was unarmed.Khalil's death throws Starr and her family into a tailspin. The media has already branded Khalil a drug dealer and a thug. Starr doesn't feel like she can tell her friends at school what happened because that would be exposing them to a part of her she has tried to keep hidden, but she is angered by the attitude of one of her friends toward Khalil's shooting. Starr is afraid of the ramifications of telling the truth of what happened that night to police, prosecutors, everyone—what if police target her family? What if others think she should just keep her mouth shut? And will speaking up make the difference anyway, if most of the time white cops don't pay the price for shooting black people?\"I've tweeted RIP hashtags, reblogged pictures on Tumblr, and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down. Now I am that person, and I'm too afraid to speak.\"Starr's involvement in Khalil's death uncovers friction in a number of places—between her parents, who argue about the merits of getting their family out of their neighborhood versus their responsibility to making sure it doesn't die; between her father and his nemesis, the leader of a powerful gang, who is intertwined with Starr's family in too many different ways; between her and Chris, as well as her friends at school; and between the factions of their neighborhood and others in the community, some who riot for the sake of rioting and don't care what destruction they cause, and some who understand the power of their actions.The Hate U Giveis tremendously moving and just so current given what is happening in our society. While certainly it focuses on police brutality and the anger minorities feel when the authorities don't get punished for doing wrong, it is quick to point out that not all police are bad, just as not all black people are drug dealers, gang members, or looking to do harm. This is a book about racism, but it's also a book about family, friendship, loyalty, community, and how often it truly does take a village to save someone. This is a book that addresses the plight that many young black men face, but it doesn't place the blame on anyone but them, either.I thought Thomas did a great job with this book, making sure it wasn't too heavy-handed in its messaging or too extreme in its plot. She created characters you grew to care about, characters you were invested in, so when pivotal events occurred, you were moved by them. This really blew my mind, and I think this is a book which really deserves all of the hype it is getting.Several times in the book Starr's mother uttered the quote, \"Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.\" I hopeThe Hate U Givereaches those despairing whether doing the right thing is still worth it even if it doesn't get the result they want. Because it really, truly is.See all of my reviews athttp://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."

        "user_review": "Audiobook: A VERY NON-TRADITIONAL REVIEW: - just sharing....not really a review...My typical days are like boot camp lately -walking between 7-10 miles a day -PLUS an hour circuit weight resistance class ( 4 mile walk to class from my house) -- then I often walk to a cafe - eat & drink something - check-in with Goodreads -- try to touch base with this community- a few 'one-on- one' chatting exchanges--during my sitting break.Sometimes I try to talk into the phone while I walk. Typos exposed!Before walking to my weight residence class - I'm often at the gym at 5 AM-- a few weights & stretching to begin - then an hour to 90 minutes of cardio 'while' reading from my paper white -BEFORE THAT....I've read in bed a few hours 'before' the gym....Exhausted yet? For relaxation-- I've added back an OLD FARTS YOGA CLASS.....AN EASY CLASS .... much too easy for me --but it's perfect! The breathing alone and time for inner blessings -private time to experience being 'one' with the world - hoping to be a better person, is worth the extra time spent in class. I send out blessings to family & friends while I'm in my own space on my own yoga mat. ( very private & personal but real for me)....Why am I sharing this? I retired from traditional reviews--- but I may write a few NON- TRADITIONAL REVIEWS as my way to feel connected with people here I love and am forever thankful for!!!After receiving the crappy diagnosis of osteoporosis on July 3rd this year --I knew I had to make changes. Take the yucky medication - and not fight it.. GET THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF CALCIUM in my diet not under-eat... and get out of the chair. Writing reviews that take an hour or more won't build bone density.So-- I started downloading as many audiobooks I could get my hands on - free- from the library overdrive. I paid for a few too. Getting ready for walking- moving daily boot camp - reading included.When I finished \"The Hate U Give\".... taking my turn at this book, which I recommend everyone take THEIR TURN, ....I still had about 1 more mile walk home. I was DYING TO CONNECT WITH MY DAUGHTERS. This book did that to me.So.... HOW DOES A MOM CONNECT WITH THEIR ADULT KIDS WHEN THEY ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY - and they can't talk at the moment?Perfect solution: play music that reminds you of them!!!So-- I immediately listen to Aerosmith, \"Don't Want to Miss A Thing\", from Armageddon---Ali insisted on playing that song as her 'opening song' at her Bat Mitzvah.....nothing Jewish about it!- and we have a luv/thing with Aerosmith together.For Katy - I played \"Someone Else's Story\" from the Broadway Musical \"Chess\". It's such a beautiful song ( listen to it). Katy use to sing it often! She always brings tears to my eyes when she sings it. Her voice is beautiful.And how does ANY OF THIS RELATE TO \"The Hate You Give\"? I have no idea ....other than all these emotions - thoughts & feelings ARE ASSOCIATED with THIS BOOK.Somehow they are all tied together!!!!I'll leave you with one sentence in this book that - for me - represents the context of this beautiful- heartbreaking story.\"A Good Garden Needs A Good Conversation\".5 Strong stars!!! I vote the audiobook!"

        "user_review": "\"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\"- Martin Luther King Jr.If you ask me there is no quote that would describe the essence of\"The Hate U Give\"better than this one. Heaven knows, to speak up for yourself and your beliefs is never easy, but if you don't do it your voice won't be heard and things will continue to go on the way they were before.It's a lesson our heroine Starr learns the hard way and it's a more than just important lesson as well.\"I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down.Now I am that person, and I'm too afraid to speak.\"I could understand Starr's internal battle and I could relate to her so much. To admit that she's the witness, to speak up for Khalil and to say what truly happened... well, it takes guts to take that step. Especially because she was smack in the middle of it all. On the one hand there were the King Lords and the gang members at Garden Heights and on the other hand there was the police. Neither of both sides was all too keen on hearing the truth about what went down that night (and this is putting it mildly), but the truth needed to be heard and I think it was very brave of Starr to find her voice. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed watching her journey.\"Oh, we know the truth, that's not what we want,\" says Daddy. \"We want justice.\"Of course her family tried to protect her from harm and wanted to keep her identity anonymous but the more things happened, the harder it got to stay out of it. You might say that Starr eventually ended up in all that mess her family tried to protect her from, but then again it wasn't really like she had a choice. If your best friend would have been murdered in front of your eyes, if he would have been unarmed, his back to the police officer that shot him, the only thing he did a concerned glance into his car because you were the co-driver and he didn't want you to get hurt. What would you have done after you held him dying in your arms?\"The truth casts a shadow over the kitchen – people like us in situations like this become hashtags, but they rarely get justice. I think we all wait for that one time though, that one time when it ends right.\"Yes, you would have wanted to get justice too! At least I would have wanted it because there's nothing in this world that makes me feel more helpless and angry than injustice and the injustice that happened in this book was outrageous!!!\"But Khalil didn't stay put, did he?\" she says.\"He didn't pull the trigger on himself either.\"I loved Starr so much for that statement alone! There were two police officers interrogating her and all they tried to do was to put the blame on Khalil. Because of course it was his fault that he got shot! He was a drug dealer after all, right?NO!! HELL, NO!!!!Even if he would have been a drug dealer this wouldn't have made things right! He was unarmed, he didn't do anything wrong, he only checked on his friend and he had to die for it.THIS IS NOT OKAY!!! THIS IS NOT RIGHT!!! THIS IS WRONG!!!And no matter how much people tried to discredit him, nothing of what they said about him was the truth!!!\"Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.\"The truth is that he was just a normal kid, driving home his best friend after they left from a party. End of the story. Or it should have been... What I really liked about this book was that it made you think. I mean Starr's own uncle is a policeman and a good and righteous one at that. Yet there were also those officers that treated her father so badly and tried to intimidate her. Just because you're a cop you're not automatically a good person, just because you're black you're not automatically a drug dealer. Just because you go to a private school you're not automatically rich.Angie Thomas plays with ingrained prejudices and subjective perceptions. In\"The Hate U Give\"she shows us that supposedly good people can be bad and that people who seem to have a bad reputation can have a kind heart too. There occur at least as many prejudices against white people as there appear against black ones. For instance Starr's father Maverick doesn't like her boyfriend and is distrustful of him because he's white. And Starr is the cool kid at her school because she's one of the few students that attend the school and are black. Quite honestly, if I go by Starr's and her friend's definition of being black I'd be black through and through. *lol* I don't like green bean casserole and for me Macaroni and cheese is a snack that comes out of the oven (thus a side dish) So I guess according to their reasoning that makes me as black as them! XD\"At an early age I learned that people make mistakes, and you have to decide if their mistakes are bigger than your love for them.\"Despite all the humour that can be found in here, the message of this book is quite clear though: We're all human, we all make mistakes, family is important and got your back, justice must be practiced and lived, we shouldn't be judged for our skin colour and we should always stand up for our beliefs, no matter how hard it is.I think that's a great message and one that should be heard! So thank you Angie Thomas for writing this book, for giving Starr a strong voice, for allowing us to get a glimpse of other people's lives and for showing me that Starr's family is as funny, caring and crazy as mine.A great book with an important message! Read it and let it be heard! =)__________________________________I'm probably the last person who reads this but I finally got a copy from my library!!!I wanted to read\"The Hate U Give\"for ages but as it seems this book is still in high demand.Also a fun fact that probably makes me one hell of a super oaf:When I was at the library I was always looking for \"The Hate U Give\" and about two months ago I was skimming through the book shelves and saw a book spine that had \"THUG\" written on it.I was like: \"Huh? That's a strange book title!\", but eventually continued to skim the shelves.Erm, well yeah. I get a feeling I could have read this book way sooner if I would have known this was the shortcut! *lol*This said, let's finally do this! XD"

As much as we think life is \"us against them\" it is really \"us against us\". Across all races there are good and bad people, wise and reckless decisions are made, opinions formulated, etc. But, in the end, there is not much difference between all of us.This book does a great job of opening the discussion with fairness and open-mindedness. While the setting was inner city in the midst of racial tensions, the book was well written to be accessable to all readers. This is awesome because I think all people should give this story a try. Even if you don't care for YA or worry the subject matter might make you uncomfortable (in which case, you probably need a little uncomfortableness in your life) you should still give it a go.I listened to the audiobook and the narrator was fantastic. If you tend to prefer audio or are thinking of reading this and wonder which format to try, the audio is definitely worth it. Bahni Turpin gives Angie Thomas' already lively dialogue an extra bump of passion with superb delivery and characterization.Again, we all live together on this planet and there will not be enough room for us if we continue to let the hate between us grow. This book not only shows what happens if the hate grows, but also what happens when we work together to overcome it."

None of this is about me and this review is probably pretty inconsequential in the larger scheme of things, but I simply do not feel comfortable leaving it as it is or even just deleting it without explaining why.On a simply literary level, I still do not think this book was particularly well written.

This book was phenomenal. it completely lived up to the hype.I have a lot of thoughts on this so here they are (keep in mind this is coming from an Asian American from the Bay Area):I loved how educational it was. It really made you understand the Black Lives Matter movement and the reality of it. It hit every single point and put you right in the middle of it.I also liked how Angie Thomas made brought up big points in really subtle ways. For example, \"Funny how it works with white kids though. It's dope to be black until it's hard to be black\" (11). That is so true. People only like black culture when it's cool , but the minute something bad happens to the black community, they distance themselves from it. But the quote that really hit hard was, \"Funny. Slave masters thought they were making a difference in black people's lives too. Saving them from their 'wild African ways.' Same Shit, different century. I wish people them would stop thinking that people like me need saving\" (246). I read that quote and was like, damn, preach it girl!The minority alliance between Starr and Maya made me so happy. It was so good to see a black girl and her Asian best friend team up. Angie Thomas could have done a bit more with it, but it was still nice to see it included. Personally, I think we need more minority alliances because there is more that unites us than divides us and together we can make a big impact. #Asians4BlackLivesI also liked that this tackled interracial dating. It added an extra layer to the complexity of this novel.The pop culture references were a really nice and unexpected touch. I was definitely not expecting High School Musical and the Jonas Brothers to be mentioned in this book.Overall, this book was everything. It should be taught in schools because despite being fiction, it was so informative, thought provoking, and leaves the door open for a lot of discussion."

This book is so amazing!I just love how real the story is. I just love how real the main protagonist's family is. It definitely defines a family.The main themes of the plot, that is, racism or cop violence or shootings has not been overdone. The writing is just to the point and so damn enjoyable. And the best part about the writing which I rarely find in fiction is the humour that is on spot!The trauma is real. The struggles of being a witness, to make our voices heard and how a tragic incident brings out the true colours of the people around us and also how people try to manipulate the situation have been presented so realistically and vividly that it seems like you have been witnessing everything right in front of your eyes. The characters are alive! Whether it's the child parent relationship, boyfriend girlfriend one, friendships fake and real, hatred or just plain mundane relationships in the book, I feel like all these are pretty dynamic and real.At times, I was expecting some cliché parts as it is a young adult fiction but damn, this book went far beyond my expectations. I am so damn happy.And the ending was so well done. All the drama and the tension. All the young adult chaos. Everything wrapped up beautifully! I got so overwhelmed (good kind!) that I ended up crying as the book ended.*I would nominate this one for the best young adult fictional parents characters, best fictional half-brother character, best interracial dating trobe, best family dynamics in YA fiction. And also, one of the cutest best young adult boyfriend character. Chris rocks. Seven, the brother, is so amazing. And the parents! I got jealous cos ... Damn. Everyone deserves parents like them.Oh, this book still needs more hype than it already is being overhyped!"

        "user_review": "After reading this book, I can certainly see what all the uproar is about. 'The Hate U Give' addresses the very sensitive issues of race relations and police brutality in a time when the nation is torn over these issues. Most of my friends are at one extreme or the other when it comes to the #Blacklivesmatter movement. Since I don't want to incite an online mobbing, I'm going to do my best to avoid that movement specifically, while sharing my thoughts and opinions on this wonderful book.First of all, this is a very moving story. It centers on a teenage black girl, Starr Carter, who leaves her crime-riddled neighborhood each day to attend an affluent school across town. In both settings, she feels a need to conform to the social norms. This means that she lives a double-life of sorts -- she has one persona with her black family and friends in her neighborhood and another one with her wealthy, predominantly white, friends from her school.One night she attends a party in her neighborhood that turns violent. After leaving the party with her childhood friend, Khalil, her life and her community is forever changed. A routine traffic stop turns tragic when an unarmed Khalil is repeatedly shot by a police officer after failing to follow police instructions.The events of that night serve as the spark that sets off an explosion. Starr's neighborhood has a long-standing animosity for the police, citing multiple instances of police brutality and harassment. The death of Khalil is only the latest in a long line of atrocities.Begrudgingly, Starr is forced into the center of a media feeding frenzy. Part of her wishes that she could just hide and return to her \"old\" life, while another part wants to be brave and stand up for what she believes is right. She was in an extremely difficult situation for a young girl.Although she initially tries to remain anonymous, as the sole witness of Khalil's murder she eventually speaks out publicly. Doing so, Starr learns a lot about herself and the people that she surrounds herself with. Some will stick around to support her, others will reveal that they were never really who she thought they were.While this book certainly highlighted the issue of police brutality against blacks, there were several other takeaways for me. I applaud the author for not shying away from other issues that are controversial. For example, racism - against multiple races - was prevalent throughout this story. I appreciated that the author was forthcoming in addressing this topic, even knowing that it would likely be controversial. Two wrongs don't make a right. Racism is still racism and it is wrong, regardless of the race.Although I did find the danger of Starr's neighborhood to be exaggerated, the author also highlighted the issue of violent crime, drugs and gang warfare. Several times, there were drive-by shootings or other crimes committed in Starr's neighborhood by the residents against the residents. It was sad and the author did a good job of highlighting this issue/cycle of violence.One notable, older man in the story commented on this and I couldn't have agreed with him more. There was a lot of senseless violence and crime in Starr's neighborhood. As he said, the government needn't look further than that neighborhood to find a real terrorist. The people lived in fear, not only of the police, but of the crime lord in their midst.The conflict in Starr's family over whether to stay in the neighborhood, despite the danger, or move to a safer neighborhood, also was enlightening. There were a lot of mixed feelings and a sense of betrayal that accompanied her parent's desire to \"better\" their situation and that of their children. It reminded me of that saying about crabs in a bucket, always trying to pull one back in before they can get out. There was certainly plenty of pressure and resentment, both within and outside of her family where this was concerned. They had to balance their desire to improve their situation against the repercussions of being viewed as sell-outs. The same was true for Starr's uncle, who was a police officer.Overall, this was a wonderful book. I'd definitely recommend it to others, regardless of their views. It provides plenty of food for thought and raises awareness of several important social issues."

        "user_review": "Wow, talk about a book that can hit you with every emotion possible. Starr's character was so well written that every time she had to interact with her high school friends I cringed at their responses. This is an incredibly powerful book, not just for its political message but for the internal conflict Starr is struggling with. The story was so much deeper than that initial conflict, it really dug into who Starr is and why she feels guilty even though the reader is screaming at the pages \"You have nothing to feel badly about! You did nothing wrong!\"Though I know there are other authors out there with stories like this to tell, it's so great to see this sort of coming of age story receive the commercial success it has.I wish Angie Thomas nothing but success and good fortune in all her future endeavors."

This books and the chaotic days we're getting through made me think that: We need to learn how to fight fairly against injustice actions and decisions and speak freely about our feelings, thoughts and our bottled up anger we keep inside. But we also have to do act like civilized, thoughtful, respectful human beings to differentiate ourselves from the violent animals who disguised in human furs.I wanted to end my thoughts with this meaningful quote which may be guidance for us to a better, hopeful, healthier and fair future:\"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believed that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.\" Martin Luther King Jr."

        "user_review": "UPDATE DEC 4/5, 2017Yesterday I found out thatthis book has been banned in a Texas school district(Katy ISD). And honestly??? I'm so angry right now. Y'all probably don't know this, but I was born and currently live in Texas (hence my use of the word \"y'all\"), so I'm just extremely!! frustrated!! with the state I call \"home\"!!!!The hypothetical reasons for this ban are really, truly, insanely stupid. They say that it might be because of sexual content―sex was literally mentioned only TWICE in this book!!! And I'm sure that some books in Katy ISD's library have more sexual content than this!!! They also say that it might be because of language, and yeah, THUG has a lot of swear words. But again, I'm sure that there are some books in school libraries with just as much language as THUG, and perhaps even more.The last reason is just so SO stupid that I can literally feel my face turning red with anger: The book is banned because of its heavy topics of police brutality. Okay, yeah,it makes total sense for aschoollibrary to ban a book that iseducatingpeople about issues going on in the country they live in!!!When I read this book, my eyes were opened. Of course I knew that police brutality was happening in America; I just didn't really grasp its extent. I can't believe thata school district is banning people's right to read a book so incredibly important in today's world, that talks of issues happening RIGHT NOW and need to be addressed. Every student in Katy ISD is being denied this book from their school libraries, when they have every right to be allowed to read it, ESPECIALLY because of the topics that it handles.A school district should be working towards educating their students in a way that they will grow up to be people who will want to change the world for the better, and banning THUG isn't going to achieve that. The subjects discussed in this book are so so important, andI honestly cannot believe that someone had the audacity to ban such an influential book.They are smothering the voices of almost 3 million black Texans, 45 million black Americans, all because the topics are [raises voice to a whine] \"too heavy\".Banning a book does not make the truth any less real, nor any less uncomfortable;it only makes you ignorant.\"Texas, o Texas, all hail the mighty state\"?? No thanks.P.S. As a form of protest of this stupid ban, you can enterHEREto win 20 copies of THUG for your library or school of choice!!! (US only)ORIGINAL REVIEW-------------------------4.5 stars.This is a book thateveryoneneeds to read.No matter what race you are, this is just SUCH an important book, and if there's one book that needs to be assigned to all school reading, it's this one. It has been a New York Times bestseller for MONTHS, and all for good reason.WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK●It has such an important message.The Hate U Give talks about police brutality in America, and how white policemen are shooting innocent, unarmed black men. It offers a view point from Starr Carter, who witnessed her black friend Khalil's death at the hands of a white police man.●It is just so eye-opening.Many people know about this issue. But THUG allows you to perceive the story from a personal viewpoint. It opens your eyes to how some black people are living because of stereotypes and discriminations—and often, they're not the best lives. Starr has a unique perspective, being from a black neighborhood in a white school, and witnessing racism at its worst, and it just is so enlightening to see this.● I live in America, and while I knew that incidents like this were happening, I didn't think it was to this extent. I was clueless and oblivious and blind. So for me to read this book and realize the horrors that are going on in my country… it was shocking. But that's just another reason why you HAVE to read this book. Becauseit truly opens your eyes to how far racism towards black people go in America.●It is so true and realistic.I honestly almost cried several times because of how unfair and unjust the discrimination was. I got so so frustrated?? Not with the book, but with the world—of how something this inhumane and horrifying can happen, andishappening. I'm not even kidding, it was EXTREME frustration, as in I-want-to-throw-this-book-across-the-room-but-I-won't-because-it's-a-book frustration, and if a book can make you feel deep emotions like that, you know it's good. (My BR partner also was frustrated many times, so you know it's not just me!)●It's written… beautifully??I don't know, I just find Angie Thomas' writing style so easy to read and honest and raw. Or maybe it's just Starr's voice. Whatever it is, the book was just super enjoyable to read, which helped balance out the fact that the topic it was talking about was so HEAVY.●The characters are amazing!!Starr is so precious and I just love her. Even tho she wants people to speak up when they witness things like she did, she just can't find the courage to do it herself. That fear makes her so realistic and relatable and you just root for her the entire book. Her family is JUST as amazing, too. They all have such great relationships with each other—they may have their rough spots but they love each other (and it's great to see such good family dynamics in YA).●The pacing is A+.Usually I have lots of problems with the pacing of contemporaries, but this was just perfect. Although I do feel like some of the novel could be cut out because it was so long, I understand that this novel was meant to be very character-focused.●The ending is just beautiful.It's not exactly thehappiest ending, but it is the most realistic, and that's just what Angie is trying to portray. She presents unfairness and leads you to think of how absolutely HORRIBLE it is… and then reveals that you don't get justice. It's worse in real life, and I think it's such an honest and perfect way to end this book.This book has such high praise from everyone, and it's not for nothing. This truly isone of the most powerful YA books I've ever read, and the message it has so inspiring. In a world today where so many people face racism—even if it's in the form of a \"joke\"—this is a book that everyone needs to read. It is SO SO eye-opening and influential. I can't say it enough, god, just READ THE BOOK.//buddy readwiththe actual sweetest ever"

        "user_review": "For all the white people who said this book was racist, let me tell you one thing : racism was invented by white people. You can feel prejudiced or discriminated against, but don't call it racism.I'm a biracial person - hi my dad's family's from Vietnam. And as a biracial person I found this book quite hard to read sometimes mostly because of all the comments on interracial relationships. But now again, the way I have to deal with racism isn't the same way Black people have to deal with it, so obviously the way I react to this book won't be the same as Black people do. So yes, I see - but still condemn - why white people - mostly - weren't happy about some subjects of this book, but then again guys, this book isn't about you, it's not about how you feel about the BLM movement, not about how you feel 'insulted' by a Black man saying he doesn't trust White people, it's about what White racist people created throughout the years. YES I felt uncomfortable while reading the comments about interracial relationships in this book but YES I realize it has nothing to do with me - because this book isn't about my culture - and YES if a Black person tells you you're being racist you have every right - you're even encouraged - to shut the hell up because I think they know what racism looks like.Also, to everybody who says racism isn't a thing anymore …. how dare you ? How dare you ?! Racism is everywhere, I don't care if you believe it or not, but it is. Racism is taught to us from kindergarten, when someone makes fun of somebody else's accent, of someone else's culture, it's EVERYWHERE so stop saying it doesn't exist anymore. It does. And people are killed in the name of racism, and they never get the justice they deserve, because YES racism is still a thing, even nowadays in our so called 'advanced society'. Racism, racism, racism, RACISM. Get used to this word because it's a reality for a lot of us.And this book shows exactly what I'm talking about, and I was mad while reading it because it hurts to see some people are still so blind, and ignorant, and mean.I also would like to talk about something, because if you don't know this I'm French and policemen in my country don't have guns, so I'm not all that familiar - and I'm grateful - with people being killed because they're people of colour. But unfortunately we're familiar with people being beaten up sometimes for NOTHING but the medias will always find something to defend the cops who did something wrong. Every single time. If an innocent man gets punched or worse by a policeman, I don't give a fuck if he sells drugs or anything else, I just don't care, but what I care about is that this man is basically being told that it's his fault if the policeman reacted this way. And in this book people say it's okay if Khalil's dead because he's a drug dealer and he would have died anyway … but in what world do we live ? People getMURDEREDon assumptions and then it's their fault ? How the fuck does this sound right to you ?This book is EXTREMELY important. If you think it's overhyped, then it means there is a problem with you, because this book isn't. This book is about the truth, the ugly truth. And I liked that it's explicitly said that all cops aren't bad cops, all cops aren't like the one who killed Khalil, because that is important to remember. And the interracial couple was well done. Yes Chris and Starr were cute, but that wasn't just that. Chris is respectful, he doesn't try to 'steal' Starr's culture, but he does everything to understand her and learn from his mistakes. And so does Starr.It would be so easy to quit if it was just about me, Khalil, that night, and that cop. It's about way more than that though. It's about Seven. Sekani. Kenya. DeVante.It's also about Oscar.Aiyana.Trayvon.Rekia.Michael.Eric.Tamir.John.Ezell.Sandra.Freddie.Alton.Philando.It's even about this little boy in 1955 who nobody recognized at first - Emmett.The messed-up part ? There are so many more.Yet I think it'll change one day. How ? I don't know. When ? I definitely don't know. Why ? Because there will always be someone ready to fight. Maybe it's my turn.Around the Year in 52 books 2017.11. A category from another challenge.From the Diversity Bingo Challenge 2017 - POC ON THE COVER."

        "user_review": "I'm trying to write a term paper on this poem (key word is \"trying\") and then I realized, hey, I should waste some time by writing a review of the poem on Goodreads! So here we are.Here's my thing about T.S. Eliot: the man is ungodly brilliant and I love almost everything he's written. Does this mean I understand a single goddamn word of it? Of course not. But (and this is the great part)that doesn't matter. Eliot has been quoted as saying he's perfectly aware that no one has any idea what his poems are about, and he's perfectly cool with that.UnderstandingEliot's poems is not the point; the point is to recognize that he writes with incredible skill and to just lose yourself in the words. My Lit book,How to Read a Poem, said it best:\"Eliot is often see as an intellectually difficult, fearfully elitist writer, and so in some ways he was. But he was also the kind of poet who put little store by erudite allusions, and professed himself quite content to have his poetry read by those who had little idea what it meant. It was form - the material stuff of language itself, its archaic resonances and tentacular roots - which mattered most to him. In fact, he once claimed to have enjoyed reading Dante in the original even before he could understand Italian...In some ways a semi-literate would have been Eliot's ideal reader. He was more of a primitivist than a sophisticate. He was interested in what a poem did, not what it said - in the resonances of the signifier, the lures of its music, the hauntings of its grains and textures, the subterranean workings of what one can only call the poem's unconscious.\"Translation: in Eliot's eyes, we are all uncultured idiots, and he wouldn't have it any other way.So, for those of you struggling to get through the wordy, allusion-tastic, multiple-language maze that isThe Waste Land, I can only tell you this: Relax and just enjoy the ride. You have nothing to fear. T.S. Eliot loves you.Read for: Perspectives on Literature"

        "user_review": "The Waste Land, T.S. EliotThe Waste Land is a long poem by T. S. Eliot, widely regarded as one of the most important poems of the 20th century and a central work of modernist poetry.Published in 1922, the 434-line poem first appeared in the United Kingdom in the October issue of Eliot's The Criterion and in the United States in the November issue of The Dial. It was published in book form in December 1922.Among its famous phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\", and the mantra in the Sanskrit language \"Shantih shantih shantih\".The poem's structure is divided into five sections.The first section, \"The Burial of the Dead,\" introduces the diverse themes of disillusionment and despair.The second, \"A Game of Chess,\" employs vignettes of several characters—alternating narrations—that address those themes experientially. \"The Fire Sermon,\"The third section, offers a philosophical meditation in relation to the imagery of death and views of self-denial in juxtaposition influenced by Augustine of Hippo and eastern religions.After a fourth section, \"Death by Water,\" which includes a brief lyrical petition.The culminating fifth section, \"What the Thunder Said,\" concludes with an image of judgment.For once I myself saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a cage, and when the boys said, \"Sibyl, what do you want?\" she replied \"I want to die.\"عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «سرزمین ویران (حسین رازى، حمید عنایت و چنگیز مشیرى)»؛ «سرزمین هرز (بهمن شعله ور، مهدى وهابى)»؛ «دشت سترون و اشعار دیگر (پرویز لشکری)»؛ «دشت سترون (شهریار شهیدی)»؛ «ارض موات (بیژن الهی)»؛ «خراب آباد؛ معجزه قرن بیستم (محمد حامد نوری)»؛ «سرزمبن بی حاصل (حسن شهباز، جواد علافچی)»؛ شاعر: تی.اس الیوت تی. اِس. اِلیوت با نام کامل «توماس استرنز الیوت»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش ماه مارس سال دوهزار و دو میلادیسرزمین بی حاصل: نخستین چاپ این منظومه با عنوان «سرزمین ویران» با ترجمه جنابان آقایان «حسین رازى»، «حمید عنایت» و «چنگیز مشیرى»، در اسفند ماه سال 1334هجری خورشیدی، در جُنگ هنر و ادب امروز، دفتر اول چاپ شد؛در زمستان سال1343هجری خورشیدی، جناب «بهمن شعله ور» اقدام به ترجمه این اثر کردند، که با همین عنوان «سرزمین هرز»، در مجله آرش منتشر شدانتشارات نیل در تهران نیز، در سال1350هجری خورشیدی، این شعرها را با عنوان «دشت سترون و اشعار دیگر» به چاپ رساندند، که ترجمه ی آن را جناب «پرویز لشکرى» انجام داده بودنددر سال1357هجری خورشیدی مترجم دیگرى نیز به سراغ شعرهاى «الیوت» رفتند؛ این بار جناب «حسن شهباز»، کتاب «الیوت» را ترجمه و به بنگاه ترجمه و نشر کتاب سپردند؛نشر فاریاب در سال1362هجری خورشیدی، ترجمه ی جناب «بهمن شعله ور» را، با عنوان «سرزمین هرز»، بار دیگر به نام خود چاپ و منتشر کردآخرین ترجمه پیش از کتاب حاضر نیز، در مؤسسه ی نشر هما، با عنوان «دشت سترون» انجام شداین کتاب در سال1377هجری خورشیدی در بازار کتاب ایران توزیع شد؛همچنین نشر امتداد در تهران هم، به سراغ شعرهاى این شاعر بریتانیا رفته، و کتاب «سرزمین هرز» را با ترجمه ی جناب «مهدى وهابى» چاپ و منتشر کرده استترجمه هاى یاد شده، در حال حاضر از کتابهاى کمیاب بازار کتاب هستند؛ البته به این فهرست، علاوه بر ترجمه ی جناب «جواد علافچی»، ترجمه ی جناب «هومن عزیزی» را هم، که در سایت اینترنتی «مانی ها» منتشر شده، باید افزودنقل تکه ای از شعر: درخت خشک سایه ندارد؛ جیرجیرک، راحتت نمی­گذارد؛ در این سنگ­های خشک، صدای آبی نیست؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 24/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

So this is where all those lines come from? \"April is the cruelest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and \"Consider Phlebas\"?Well, damn.I was a science major in college, and took humanities courses for fun, but neither one of my two required English classes covered this poem. And so I missed out on deep analysis or even just not too deep explanation. Because I just read it four times in a row — and no, I don't get it. I tried to read some annotations, and I just don't get it. I even found three different Russian translations of this poem hoping that a different language would help elucidate meaning.And still no luck — even after resultant seven(!!!) times reading it.Individual bits make sense (sometimes) but the big picture, the gestalt, escapes me. Unless it's not supposed to come together, in which case I'm cool.Ahhh, that's a good line.I may be a tad suspicious of poetry that requires extensive annotations to get it. Apparently the poem alone is under 20 pages but there is a 320 page book with annotations for it??? I can just picture Eliot rubbing his hands together and giggling in the supervillain-like manner over the image of generations of English scholars mining the poem for meaning.But hey, the opening four lines are just amazing; there's absolutely nothing about them that isn't perfect:\"April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain.\"I mean, I don't even care that reading it seven times in a row, in two different languages, left me confused. Those four lines with that rhythm and cadence and whatever that literary trick of ending those lines like that — those alone are worth it.Oh, and this one caught my attention:\"And upside down in air were towersTolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hoursAnd voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.\"Yeah. Beautiful. And frustratingly difficult.But now I can feel all smug knowing where the quotable lines come from, even if I still have no clue about what it actually *is*.Star ratings? These are meaningless here. So 4 stars for 4 perfect opening lines.——————Also posted onmy blog."

I must know a fair amount of it by heart.Here's a story about \"The Waste Land\" that some people may find amusing. Many years ago, when I was an undergraduate in Cambridge, a friend of mine asked me for advice on how to impress female Eng Lit majors. Well, I said, you could do worse than use The Waste Land. Just memorise a few lines, and you'll probably be able to bluff successfully.We did some rehearsals, and eventually agreed on the following script. He would start off by quoting the first few lines:\"April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain.\"And then he would say, But that's not my favourite bit! and quote the following:\"What are the roots that clutch, what branches growOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,You cannot say, or guess.\"He tried it out a couple of times, and it worked! Female Eng Lit majors, I apologise for assisting with this deception. It wasn't very nice of me."

        "user_review": "I read a lot of poems as an English major back in the day.* Not many have stuck with me over the years, butThe Waste Landis one of them: T.S. Eliot's lamentation about the spiritual drought in our day, the waste land of our Western society, lightened by a few fleeting glimpses of hope. It's fragmented, haunting, laden with symbolism and allusions, difficult, and utterly brilliant.A diverse cast of characters take turns narrating the poem, or having their conversations overheard by the narrator, including:✍ a Lithuanian countess, reminiscing about her childhood and life (\"I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter\")✍ a prophetic voice, like Ezekiel, examining the barrenness of civilization (\"Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you know only A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, And the dead tree gives no shelter ...\")✍ Madame Sosostris, a famous but fake clairvoyant, telling a fortune with tarot cards (\"I do not find the Hanged Man. Fear death by water. I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. Thank you.\")✍ a bored woman of leisure, talking to her husband, who answers in his mind (\"What are you thinking of? What thinking? What? I never know what you are thinking. Think. / I think we are in rats' alley Where the dead men lost their bones.\")✍ Two women talking in a bar about sex and abortion (\"Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart. He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you To get yourself some teeth.\")... and many more. Those are just the main ones in the first two (of five) sections). Symbols of drought and fertility, spiritual waste and renewal, surface and resurface, showing a different facet each time. I'd forgotten that the Holy Grail (cup) and Holy Lance (spear) doubled as a nifty set of female/male sexual symbols!This is a poem that deserves to be read, taken apart and studied, and then simply read again and appreciated.\"These fragments I have shored against my ruins...\"*I still have my 2600 pageThe Norton Anthology of English Literature, which has extensive analysis and footnotes. It also has my helpful handwritten margin notes from 30+ years ago, written in the most amazingly lovely, minuscule handwriting imaginable (seriously, the letters are about a half a millimeter high) that I could never in a million years recreate now."

        "user_review": "THIS IS THE END, BEAUTIFUL FRIENDNon è una semplice poesia: è ben più lunga, è un poemetto.Ma è anche ben più breve della sua fama, di tutte le parole spese intorno a questo componimento, che è entrato nella storia, non solo letteraria, sia per lo splendido titolo, che per quel primo magnifico verso,Aprile è il più crudele dei mesi.Ma siccome non potrei proprio dire che io e la poesia abbiamo un rapporto stretto e felice, dato che ci frequentiamo molto poco, ai celebri versi di Eliot sono arrivato per via traversa.Via cinema, a causa di un film.Uno dei capolavori di Francis Ford Coppola,Apocalypse Nowdove Brando/Kurtz recita Eliot.Anche se non recita questi versi, bensì quelli di un'altra poesia, sempre di T.S. Eliot, intitolataThe Hollow Men.Se non che, Coppola inquadra nell'antro di Kurtz un libro di Eliot insieme ad altri, eThe Waste Landè intriso del famoso romanzo di Conrad che viene sempre tirato in ballo a proposito del film di Coppola: la connessione sembra piuttosto diretta, e una cosa tira l'altra, ho voluto leggere ancheLa terra desolata.Apocalypse Nowfu probabilmente il primo film in lingua originale che ho visto: era quella che all'epoca si chiamava una \"prima visione\". Ero appena approdato in California per la prima volta, non potevo certo perderlo.E ovviamente, l'ho visto senza sottotitoli. Ho capito meno di metà di quanto veniva detto. La voce di Jim Morrison era la cosa più comprensibile, ma su quella ero già ben preparato, conoscevo la canzone a memoria.Mi sono consolato con le immagini, potentissime.Ho rivisto il film più e più volte, non solo perché è molto bello, e perché mi piace, ma anche perché quella prima volta la mia comprensione era stata alquanto zoppicante.In ogni caso fu esperienza utilissima: da allora guardo un film solo in originale (e possibilmente con i sottotitoli) – avremo anche i doppiatori più bravi del mondo, ma il doppiaggio sottrae a un film molto ma molto di più di quanto una traduzione sottragga a un libro letto nella sua lingua.E poi, vogliamo dire di quando DeNiro, Hoffmann, Stallone, Pacino avevano tutti la stessa voce italiana, per giunta con un difetto di pronuncia (credo si definisca zeppola)?!E poi, vogliamo dire che da quando ragioni economiche (= risparmio) hanno ridotto i tempi di doppiaggio, anche la qualità dei migliori doppiatori del mondo è ben altra?La voce di Brando è un'altra esperienza imperdibile.Il film di Coppola per una serie di circostanze è ammantato di mistero, a cominciare dal momento della realizzazione, le riprese: un uragano che abbatte tutti i set, un'isola filippina incendiata e distrutta per esigenze di copione… Vero o falso?Alla première del Festival di Cannes, Coppola portò due versioni, o meglio due finali: in uno Willard torna a casa, nell'altro rimane e prende il posto di Kurtz.Ma le versioni del film sono di più, non differiscono solo per il finale, da una all'altra cambia molto la durata, si può arrivare a più di tre ore."

        "user_review": "I would not presume to offer anything approaching a definitive judgment of this unique and influential poem, a poem which presents us—in early modernist fashion—with a provocativecollageof voices and scenes, fragments which Eliot has collected from the \"heap of broken images\" that litter the desert of our culture, but which he presents in a way that grants them new terror and new poignancy, in a way that shows us \"fear in a handful of dust\" and hints--if only by its absence--at the possibility of a greener world to come.First off, let me say I was disappointed in this little edition. I picked it up initially because it contained an introduction by Paul Maldoon, an Irish poet with a reputation for allusiveness and obscurity—just the sort to illuminate this fragmentary and cryptic masterpiece.But his introduction is brief and not terribly helpful, and his enthusiasm for Irish literature leads him to see literary connections where they do not exist. For example, although I believe he is correct when he says the \"Nighttown\" episode ofUlyssesis a major influence on the poem, he is mistaken when he speculates that Eliot's working title for it,\"He Do the Police in Different Voices\" is also derived from this episode. (It is actually a quotation from a character in Dicken'sA Mutual Friend, who is describing the oral reading technique of her precocious foster child, how he brings to life the crime stories published in the sensational magazine,The Police Gazette.)I was also disappointed in the lack of notes. I was looking for more extensive annotations, because I need them to help me unmask many references in this often obscure poem. But when they said \"notes,\" I guess the editors just meant Eliot's original notes, which are almost invariably appended to the poem anyway, whatever the edition.I'll end by reproducing a few passages which illustrate something I noticed for the first time this reading: the large number of gothic and decadent images in this poem. In spite of its classical allusions, modernist structure and tone, we are still not that far from the decadent '90's here:\"That corpse you planted last year in your garden,\"Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?\"Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?\"Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men,\"Or with his nails he'll dig it up again!\"You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!\"* * * * * * * * *In vials of ivory and coloured glassUnstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confusedAnd drowned the sense in odours…* * * * * * * * *Above the antique mantel was displayedAs though a window gave upon the sylvan sceneThe change of Philomel, by the barbarous kingSo rudely forced...And other withered stumps of timeWere told upon the walls; staring formsLeaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.* * * * * * * * *A rat crept softly through the vegetationDragging its slimy belly on the bank...White bodies naked on the low damp groundAnd bones cast in a little low dry garret,Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year.* * * * * * * * *Who is the third who walks always beside you?When I count, there are only you and I togetherBut when I look ahead up the white roadThere is always another one walking beside youGliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hoodedI do not know whether a man or a woman—But who is that on the other side of you?* * * * * * * *A woman drew her long black hair out tightAnd fiddled whisper music on those stringsAnd bats with baby faces in the violet lightWhistled, and beat their wingsAnd crawled head downward down a blackened wallAnd upside down in air were towersTolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hoursAnd voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.In this decayed hole among the mountainsIn the faint moonlight, the grass is singingOver the tumbled graves, about the chapelThere is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.It has no windows, and the door swings,Dry bones can harm no one.Only a cock stood on the rooftreeCo co rico co co ricoIn a flash of lightning. Then a damp gustBringing rain"

        "user_review": "April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain.The above mentioned lines mark one of the most profound onsets in the history of modernist literature; and perhaps with eruption of the highly dense, heart pounding effusion, a magical spell envelops the reader who would be kept shifting between time and space, embark and decay of civilization, prophecy and satire, philosophy and faith, life and death throughout the mind-clouding, breath- taking journey of around 433 lines; of which, some can stand on their own alone protruding their beings through the undulations of nothingness. The ghostly but spectral voyage starts withThe burial of dead, takes one along through the graveyards, stony mystical landscapes to hyacinth gardens, up to the magical but heart poundings scenes exuded out of mystery of tarot cards. At times, one might feel lost as if something unknown but with mighty prowess is carrying one to nowhere but then a sudden clout strikes your consciousness with a colossal impact, you are taken aback by sudden surge of the intensity as you come toUnreal City;and out of nowhere, death strikes you,Dante'sInfernoemerges out of cloud of your memory. You are taken through threads of life emerging out from dead. The game of black and white squares, arranged in an alternate manner to give a checkered impression, brings you to the stark absurdity of life-the change of Philomelembodies the absurdness prevailed in the life ofPhilomelwhich (who) has been transformed bygods, but as a compensation, and who cries her heart out of agony yet the world is so deaf and insensitive to her anguish that it occurs a heart-rending song toit. You are blown further on gust of wind towards a nether world where the most potent questions, but disguised under the sheath of ignorance (or perhaps incompetence), surge up by opening grand (ferocious) arms, from the depth of being and nothingness.The idea ofThe Waste Land(perhaps) seems to be sprouted out of modern problems—the war, industrialization, abortion, urban life—which the poet addresses in it and at the same time to participate in a literary tradition. Eliot once, famously, wrote his friend Conrad Akein:''It's interesting to cut yourself to pieces once in a while and wait to see if the fragments will sprout\",the imagination of Eliot resembles the decaying land that is the subject of the poem: nothing seems to take root among the stony rubbish left behind by old poems and scraps of popular culture. As the other poems of Eliot are,The Waste Landis highly symbolic and extensively use allusions, quotations (in several languages), a variety of verse forms, and a collage of poetic fragments to create the sense of speaking for an entire culture in crisis. It's a poem of radical doubt and negation, urging that every human desire be stilled except the desire for self-surrender, for restraint, and for peace. The poets has blend satire and absurdity so well that it looks probably a superhuman task to determine whether the use of some themes/ rhymes, in way which cajoles a seemingly comic effect, is deliberate or accidental as surfaces up. The poem is quite meticulously, but effortlessly, written in fragments- not like traditional verses- which would give altogether different effects to the reader when they are read in fragments or in entirely.The poem concludes with a rapid series of allusive literary fragments: seven of the last eight lines are quotations. As one moves through these quotations, it might occur as if the poem becomes conscious of itself, the being of the poem emanates from the verbose kingdom of words and the poem itself stands in front of the reader- staring straight into the eyes of reader; and a sudden shiver runs through his/ her spine to realize what has just traverses through the scanner of 'conscious' eyes.I sat upon the shoreFishing, with the arid plain behind meShall I at least set my lands in order?London Bridge in falling down falling down falling downPoi s'ascose mel foco che gil affinaQuando fiam uti chelidon- O swallow swallowLe Prince d'Acquitane a la tour abolieThese fragments I have shored against my ruinsWhy then Ile fir you. Hieronymo's mad againe.Datta. Dayadhvam. DamyataShantih shantih shantih.It's a great achievement in modernist art but one needs to be patient to truly feel the shivers of its magical existence; as it's a characteristic of modernism, the appreciation of the poem demands devotional labor as well as a sympathetic imagination. Beneath these meticulously crafted poetics lay assumptions about art that were curiously religious, and that fostered theories of poetry as a liturgy for the elect.ExcerptsThe Burial of DeadYour arms full, and your hair wet, I could notSpeak, and my eyes failed, I was neitherLiving or dead, and I knew nothing,Looking into the heart of light, the silence.O'ed und leer das Meer.Unreal City,Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,I had not thought death had undone so many.Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.WHAT THE THUNDER SAIDWho is the third who walks always beside you>When I count, there are only you and I togetherBut when I look ahead up the white roadThere is always another one walking beside youGilding wrapt in a brown mantle, hoodedI do not know whether a man or a woman-But who is that on the other side of you?Datta: what have we given?My friend, blood shaking my heartThe awful dancing of a moment's surrenderWhich an age of prudence can never retractBy this, and this only, we have existed."

        "user_review": "This is the hardest poem I've ever read. Certainly, the difficulty experienced when reading something is not enough reason to leave a bad review. I'm currently readingUlysses,a notoriously difficult book, but I am enjoying it nonetheless. This, however, is an entirely different creature.Despite being an English student I do find poetry difficult. It may be because of my background. I transferred from sciences into English, so I had very little experience beyond a few poems I read at school. So when I entered the world of poetry at degree level I was way out of my depth. It took me a long time to catch up on what I'd missed, and it took me even longer to actually enjoy poetry. The point is reading poetry is different to reading novels. It's harder to do, and I have to concentrate greatly to do it. But, every so often, when you find the right poem for you, it takes you away as you become lost in a mirage of words, images and metaphors. And sometimes, it strikes a chord within you and you feel everything the poem is saying.The Waste Landdoes none of these things. Instead it bombards you with countless intertextual references and information. In order to gain a thorough a succinct understanding of this poem, a poem that takes no longer than thirty minutes to read, I would likely have to spend five-six hours researching the meaning of the terminology, phrasing and historical mentions. That's how difficult it is. Perhaps if I was a white middle class, highly educated man from the nineteen-twenties then I might be able to appreciate this poem more. But, as it stands, I'm not!The worse thing about the poem for me is its lack of coherency. This in itself is not a bad thing. It's a modernist text; this is what modernist authors did. But, when combined with the fact that the surface level of the writing is near incomprehensible to me, it became rather a painful experience to read it. There are some obvious things to take from the poem. It is post world war one and the content is an image of the destruction that followed, the deprivation, the sadness, the darkness and, of course, the actually wasted land ruined by war. But these images aren't enough for me to enjoy the poem.It would be like reading Shakespeare'sThe Tempestand coming to the conclusion that it is a play about the follies of revenge. This is true, but it is also about many other things that combine to form a piece of artistic brilliance. When I readThe Waste LandI feel stupid. I feel like I'm reading something that I cannot quite understand, and this annoys me. I feel like at times T.S Elliot is being pretentious, inserting references just do demonstrate his intellect rather than contribute something meaningful to the poem at large. And I don't like it. I don't want to find out what they mean.For me this poem is everything great poetry shouldn't be. But this is just my opinion. For the right reader this poem would be excellence itself. However, it's not something I'd personally recommend. And, if that wasn't enough, as a side note, T.S Eliot is highly critical towards Shelley- we could never get on!"

And I happily refer to The Waste Land and Eliot's Nobel Prize when I do.However, I can't say I ever understood the long trail of lines that it contains, even though I read it several times.And most bizarre of all, I don't even agree with my favourite quote from it. FEBRUARY is the cruellest month: dark and cold and wet, and no end in sight!Somehow, I don't think I missed the point of the poem though, by misquoting, by disagreeing with the statement, and by not getting it at all. I think The Waste Land means just that: human confusion on all levels expressed in poetic language.February is the stupidest month too, so I might be wrong."

Sort of like my attitude to atomic weapons. You wouldn't dismiss atomic weapons as 'crap', but you could legitimately say 'I appreciate their significance but I don't like them at all.'I don't think there has ever been more literary masturbation about any other piece of writing thanThe Wasteland, and I personally found it charmless, aloof and with nothing to engage my wish to push through that first impression.Yes, it's all the pieces of the 'shattered' classical world, thrown together in a different and hideous mixture to reflect the modernists' belief that the world as they knew it, and all previous literary forms, weren't up to the task of reflecting their contemporary world - but I really don't like the result. It doesn't engage me and it doesn't illuminate me. Maybe that was the point. Still don't like it, and I'm not in university anymore, so I don't have to try to keep up with the intellectual dick-swinging which surrounds this piece. Thanks but no thanks.Anything this determinedly difficult just puts my back up, and the more I learn of Eliot himself the less I feel like tackling it. Okay, Eliot, you're a misogynistic, anti-Semitic elitist who doesn't think anyone without a classical education is worthy of reading your work.Well, fine. Fuck you. I'll take my comprehensive-educated Jewish arse elsewhere."

The flower of words feeds on hummus, and TS Eliot considers this beauty born of the ugly, the unpleasant, and the dreary. Thus, modern life and its dull appearance become spaces of a poetic genre that we would like to confine to the imaginary and the dream. The fog and the dirty glass impose their presence through the verb, which gives them a new weight, almost a new value. An Anglo-Saxon classic to taste in translation or the original language!"

        "user_review": "Akin to a cubist painting, this long poem is told through broken images, seemingly disjointed fragments, and narrated by multiple voices, with the narrator occasionally reemerging in different episodes with a brief commentary, often cryptic, while at other times, albeit rarely, illuminating. Behind this towering endeavor in poetic modernism, there is a profound sense of melancholy for it reads as Eliot's personal lament as well as his quest for a spiritual answer to the alienated, lonely and debased life brought upon by the decadence and degradation of modern times. And it still resonates in this centenary year of its publication. The \"waste land\" is above allspiritualon two planes-personal and civilizational. On the whole, it seems that for Eliot the \"memory and desire\" (already mentioned in the 3rd line), laden with multiple meanings/contexts through the poem, are at the root of suffering in interpersonal relations between the sexes (inflicting equally all levels of the social hierarchy) and in society at large, culminating in the bloodshed of World War I.The poem isverycomplicated, it's monumental in literary, mythological and religious references, impossible to decipher without good annotations. Eliot himself provided the notes, reproduced in the edition I read, that refer to the sources that inspired particular passages, usually inserted in the poem as quotes that underwent different kinds of metamorphoses in his hands. They are encyclopedic in range, whether fromWilliam Shakespeare(The Tempest, Anthony and Cleopatra, Hamlet, Coriolanus), Dante'sThe Divine Comedy, Virgil'sThe Aeneid, Ovid'sMetamorphoses, Wagner'sDer Ring des NibelungenandTristan und Isolde, Augustine'sConfessions, the Buddha'sFire Sermon,The Upanishads,The Bible, Frazer'sThe Golden Bough, Baudelaire'sLes Fleurs du Mal, and dozens and dozens of others. While essential for understanding Eliot's personal inspirations, his notes are certainly not sufficient to understand all the allusions in the poem's text, including those referencing particular names or scenes in London's life in the early 1920s. Since different passages and the poem as a whole have been variously interpreted, I feel that a first-time reader, like myself, is best served with informative annotations rather than with an interpretive commentary.There is an excellent documentary that gives a general sense ofThe Waste Landand Eliot's life, with the phenomenal Eileen Atkins, Michael Gough and Edward Fox reading the excerpts, and discussed by no less than Stephen Spender, Frank Kermode, Peter Ackroyd, and others.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoEHy...4.5/5(.5 taken off as the poem cannot be read and interpreted on its own without annotations about numerous allusions and often obscure references)"

With images coming in and out of focus, and maybe memories, or new memories, new dreams, interfering. Eliot is italicised. I am not.The Burial of the DeadApril is the cruellest month. I was born in April, rather, born on the same day as Adolf Hitler: April 20th. It is true,I read, much of the night, and I dream of goingsouth in the winter. No, south from here is only water, the faithful sea. Swimming the other day: the cold surprised us, as it always does. Skin salt and slick. And underwater, likeforgetful snow, for all the fears washed from my head – they were replaced with water. But it is notDeath by Wateryet. My swimming took me back to the Pyrenees, walking in the hills, swimming in the rivers…in the mountains, there you feel free.A dog's bark. Pine needles. And on the balcony,with a shower of rain- followed by thunder (allow me to move further into the poem here:DA). The thunder rolled through the mountains – in the winter, it makes the snow quiver, and fall from the leaves. I often wonder if a tree's voice would be muffled from under so much snow…Son of man, You cannot say, or guess. When the thunder and the snow held, and thesummer surprised us, wedrank coffee, and talked for an houron that balcony, just a stone's throw from my bed, draped with a mosquito net – as if a veil. I'll say again,I read, much of the night. France, like all other travels, return to me inbroken images. Back in England-under the brown fog of a winter dawn, memories roll away, as if thunder through the mountains. Thosebroken imagesremain. Maybe I'll dream, that in a crowd there is a man I know, with his face turned away. Maybe I'll dream that he has a man buried in his garden. I ask what kind of tree would grow from the body of a man? Answer: A tree that would whisper through layers of snow.A Game of ChessSweat down my back like salt. My brother strikes down a Bishop, I feel fear for a Rook. The sunreflecting light upon the table. In these moments of silence, between another Pawn's demise, one's mind cannot help but wander. A girl I once knew, learning the movements of a King, or Queen. Her parentsfootsteps shuffled on the stair. I could say anything,\"My nerves are bad tonight.\"She would not listen. And as I read late into the night – purple ink through her curtains – she said,\"Why do you never speak. Speak. What are you thinking of?\"So the memories loop. We are bored, so I say –We shall play a game of chess. There is no chance of rain. Even as we play we wonder,What shall we do tomorrow?There is nothing more to do. Another Pawn falls.HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME- dinner. We eat quietly – memories drifting like snow. Until,good night, good night, until tomorrow.The Fire SermonFor I have finished University now, and the list of people to ring has been cleaved in two. No moreempty bottleson a kitchen table at night, no morecigarette butts. Not a singletestimony of summer nights. Before University, my friends left school, and leftleft no addresses.One in Bath. One in Dubai. In College we went to Rome together- we learnt of Carthage – now Tunisia. Rome was our ethereal city, we said – the Tibersweats! Thepeal of bells white towers! And like all great war,burning burning burning burning. If I were Tiresias, I would have known that our days were numbered, that all days are numbered. That time is unstoppable. If only I could bethrobbing between two lives, I cry.I sat down and weptonce for them, in the past, and now I do so in the present:the last fingers of leaf clutch and sink into the wet bank- and they are swept away – forgotten, as I.Death by WaterReturning again to the sea,entering the whirlpool. The water drags one down. My brother almost drowned in a capsized boat. But he didn't, we are home now, around thecry of gulls, with our parents. My mother quiet. My father not. He laughs, crinkle-eyed, and says Iwas once handsome and tall as you- and my brother and I take that for him saying – I know I am getting older.What the Thunder SaidI have spoken of thunder. The downpours in France, England, Croatia… I remember them well. The night after thunder on the beach, clear again:sweat is dry and feet are in the sand, the tide plays with us. Silhouettedmountains of rock- but tomorrow, there will bethunder without rain. Back in the Pyreneesthere is not even solitude in the mountains. Thecicadahas its own chorus. The grass is alwayssinging. When my brother returned from his travels in India, Asia, we all wanted to askwho is that on the other side of you?, as if he brought someone home with him, as if he had grown an extra shadow, become a new man. Travelling gives us rebirth – even in ourempty roomsin Dubrovnik, Yosemite, Budapest, we cut down an old self to create a new one. We whisper:We who were living are now dying. We can tell ourselves this things when we are away from home, because when we are away from home, nothing scares us.I look ahead up the white road- my future – and see, sometimes,falling towers, and other times, apalace. There are reasons. We cannot know how many cycles are left within us, how many times we will be reborn. We do not know where we will go or what we will find. We may find Paradise. Or we may find The Waste land. And yet, I believe, that even in The Waste Land, there is chance for rebirth, for a metamorphosis.These fragments I have shored against my ruins. In aflash of lightningI am, again, anew."

        "user_review": "\"A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,And the dry stone no sound of water.\"\"The Wasteland\", a poem at the deepening crux of modernism, is a whirlwind of broken, disparate pieces fitting to explore T.S. Eliot's vision of a nihilistic world where gentle, purifying youth and spiritual inclinations/beliefs, which assuage us on the terrifying, fleeting journey of existence, float into thin air and lose their ability to free us as even the most calming, cleansing idea of an antidote, water, leads to our inevitable deaths. There is something relentlessly oppressive, habitually slovenly, and drenched chillingly in how haunting it can be to live and feel, which characterizes this poem's greatest intricacies, as it never backs away from entering into the messy realm of our own sentience and ability to perceive that the end will eventually draw near.This idea of the universe becomes absurdly paradoxical as the poem speaks of being able to not connect nothing with nothing. That calls to mind a feeling of desperate alienation and lack of ability to make sense of anything, as you walk around in a confused blizzard of your own making, which exists amidst the depths of your own self-created wasteland. As you also find yourself living in a horrifying purgatory in which you're \"neither / Living nor dead\" and you continue to know nothing, as silence washes over you mixed with vacant light. However, there could also be and arise an omnipotent presence of a dulled optimism, amidst the trapping idea of purgatory, as between living and death springs up like an incalculable flower the capacity to just quietly exist. As that slight awareness of existence fills the hollowed parts of our soul like a herbal tea warming our insides in which we've felt a bitter chill for so long.\"A current under seaPicked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fellHe passed the stages of his age and youthEntering the whirlpool.\"These lines continually whisper with the vividness of harried existentialism with the faintness of a beauty, which exists in beckoning calamity and breathless quietude, astir with temptation and desire to believe and hope. Because to believe and to hope is to stay sane amongst the greater puzzle and riddles that besiege our existence and world. We will never understand or be able to translate the foreignness of an experience we've never lived or understand even the closeness of the world that lives underneath our feet and that was much the feeling that surrounded parts of this poem, but other parts stood out to me with a clarity that I couldn't deny because those parts were part of the ornately rich tapestry, which strings us together, marking a world in which we are connected by our own universality and shared sense of the beauty and pain of the human experience."

        "user_review": "The Waste Land, Eliot's masterpiece, is a poem filled with allusions and references to everything from Shakespeare to Buddha, and one that cannot be quickly read nor easily understood. It is considered one of the most important of the modernist poems, and rightfully so.Written in 1922, in the aftermath of World War I, Eliot explores both the loss of life, its meaning, and the resultant changes in society and values. There is cynicism throughout the poem, and ultimately hope expressed in the final section–a looking back and a reaching forward.Eliot shows us detailed examples of people lost and leading empty, meaningless lives. There is a lack of morality, a turning against the natural order, a lack of faith in the future and a discarding of the lessons of the past. The masses walk through their days with hedonistic fervor and no feeling. The Waste Land is complete, and the waste is personal.The conclusion seems to me to say there is a way to overcome, not only endure, but thrive, however that way requires something of each individual. It requires, per Eliot, \"giving\" \"sympathizing\" and \"control.\" And, it seems to me Eliot tells us that it also requires faith; a faith in something larger than self. The result of such a faith being \"inner peace\".This is the third time I have studied this poem, and each time I feel I have grasped a tiny bit more. I would imagine that I could read this a dozen more times and not have digested it all. It took Eliot three years to write it, so it deserves the time and effort, but to know it in all its complexity, you need to read another dozen works, Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible among them. This edition contains Eliot's notes, criticisms by other prominent authors, and reference materials from Eliot's bibliography.I believe Eliot wanted us to work for his meaning, because I think he wanted us to understand what had been lost and that it would not be an easy thing to recover."

        "user_review": "Bookends. In February 1922, one hundred years ago, James Joyce wrote Ulysses; in December, T.S. Eliot published in America The Waste Land with notes. Both hailed in modernity. The novel would never be the same; poetry took a blind leap forward.Unlike Ulysses that spans 750 pages, The Waste Land is a mere 432 lines. It would not even fill a 32 page book so the American publisher asked and published a version complete with notes. Why? So we can understand the poem better. The notes help but there are a lot of questions that arise.There has been a great deal written on this book. English classes focus on this poem. I was fortunate to have heard the London Review of Books Close Readings series with Seamus Perry and Mark Ford that truly help to elucidate this poem. I read the poem twice and listened to the podcast twice. Believe me it works.Written after the First World War while Eliot himself was on leave after suffering an emotional breakdown, you would think this was a dark poem, as the name suggests. Yes, there is talk of the dead, but it draws from numerous historical and literary references from the Aeneid, Ovid, to the Divine Comedy, Tristan and Isolde, Paradise Lost, Baudelaire, Verlaine, Spencer and even the Upanishad. It also speaks of the modern world: of men, of women, sexuality, spirituality, of loss, of hope, and in particular, of London, England. That's a lot in such a short span. And that is it's modernity.From its beginning:April is the cruelest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain.It's middle:To Carthage then I cameBurning burning burning burningO Lord Thou pluckest me outO Lord Thou pluckestBurningTo the end:I sat upon the shoreFishing, with the acrid plain behind meShall I at least set my lands in order?London Bridge is falling down falling down falling downPoi s'acose nel foco che gli affinaQuando fiam uti chelidon-O swallow swallowLe Prince d'Aquitane à la tour abolieThese fragments I have shored against my ruinsWhy then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.Divided in five parts, the language is what makes the poem daring for the time. The poem is dedicated to Ezra Pound, who also edited the manuscript. I found the work powerful, beautiful and poignant. Yes it was written a hundred years ago but it still fascinates and resonates today.NOTE: I originally read this poem under \"The Waste Land and Other Stories\" in 1982."

        "user_review": "T. S. Eliot, who was a literary man who previously had faith in literary wisdom and social norms, I think discovered during World War I how useless lessons of wisdom and defined social mores were against processing the experience of massive wartime deaths and maiming. His personal tragedy of a very damaging marriage was also very difficult.In 'The Waste Land', I think Eliot was ranting at literature, society, religion and culture for failing to stop the 'collapse' of civilization. Eliot also rages at the ultimate impotence of classic literature to warn the individual or society about the utter devastation and cruelty of war. The poem is full of allusions to those myths and wiseman sayings which reflect the darkness in humanity rather than the wisdom. He includes bits of memory in his poem which emphasize the cluelessness and obtuseness of people.In my opinion, most Westerners suffer at a certain point in their lives a sudden feeling that civilization is collapsing because they think society has moved away from the classic ideals which maintained the life they imagine they grew up in. In most cases however, civilization is actually continuing on as it always has; it's the veils of classic idealism that the educated observer was looking through that were ripped way. To a child, Reality is a description which he has been taught to believe in. Grownups do their best to live ideally, but I think true wisdom is accepting that we often fall short of what we aspire to, but we need to get on anyway. Eliot's poem, though, is a wail of despair.I read that hundreds of thousands of young male aristocrats, many of whom were officers and the next generation of leaders, died in WWI along with millions of 'ordinary' people. I guess that this massive die-off of millions hastened the end of centuries-old medieval-class relationships which probably had given comfort, continuity and stability to most European people of the early 20th century. But the generation educated to rule by maintaining class divisions beneficial to that upper class died.I think wars before WWI used to have long pauses in the conduct of war, which was no longer possible in WWI due to the advances of war mechanization. Adding to the psychological turmoil, for a soldier surviving ongoing warfare it means you get sent to the front on multiple tours. In addition, the aftermath of every war fought close to home is a huge upheaval because of the resulting shortage of young men, a spread of disease vectors, transfers of and new concentrations of wealth, and disrupted markets.But added to the usual wartime disruptions, I think, WWI was the first war which had massive long-distance killing, not the more honorable warrior to warrior battle. Fighting sword to sword probably feels different emotionally than being killed by invisible shrapnel or powerful percussions that come out of nowhere without pause, from hearing the sound for hours of constant shelling, or dying from a gas which suffocates you invisibly. I can only imagine it.I've heard accounts from Vietnam fighters, and I guess among the usual horrors that cause PTSD, in particular, was not being able to see anything because of the thick jungles combined with the distances bullets could travel invisibly. I think the change from single face-to-face combat to sudden mass mechanized death on any army unprepared by training or TV or movies or video games (I'm not being flippant) was exponentially devastating. I know everything about war is bad, but I'm guessing if you can't see, hear, or feel the distant soldier who is killing your friends sitting 1 inch from you is a more searing experience, even with mental preparation.I think random death makes the ideals of unquestioned patriotism and honor more difficult to hang onto. Among the few rewards of being a warrior is that 'mano y mano' victory - I believe it's biology-based for many men. However, when a person's strength and intelligence and value is made moot simply because of where you accidentally happen to be standing or sitting when shrapnel strikes, it probably feels unjust, wrong, unfair, whimsical, more pointless, more meaningless, and random than you can mentally prepare for. You'd have to be shocked by the randomness of dying! It would raise questions about everything you believed about the protective 'shields' of religion, societal mores and expectations; and about being a good person as a strategy for deserving to stay alive, and about the having a purity of purpose to be deserving of winning, even being too educated, thus too smart or valuable to be killed, etc.For most Americans, the closest experience of the possibility of death comes from car or sport accidents and illnesses. Many people, of course, rely on the normal life patterns surrounding them for reassurance that they are magically protected from death. In war, though, there are no normal life patterns around them. Soldiers become aware that anyone can die and no one has magical immunity. No prayer, no amulet, no ritual, no strength or skill, no powerful person or strategy, nothing can protect you from a sudden act of warfare in the physical space around you. In the days of battle you see perfectly decent, good, family men chopped mercilessly into pieces despite their utilizing every bit of training and good fortune.I feel like having a bit of a rant myself."

In faraway lands, the defenseless Frodo and Sam still trying to reach Mount Doom, and just one wrong step away of getting caught, and everything lost.This is it, the end of the line. Tolkien saving the best for last, ending the deed with an other-worldly conclusion for the trilogy that forever changed fantasy history.

But overall, 1000% EPIC.In this final installment we get to visit some jaw dropping locations like Minas Tirith, the White Mountains, Cirith Ungol, Mordor, and Mount Doom. –uh oh scary! Not a lot of new characters stepping in this time, but plenty stepping out. A load of moments to remember by.The Lightning of the Beacons, the Path of the Dead, the Siege of Gondor, the Cave of Ungoliant, and the oopsie at Mount Doom.All questions answered, everything revealed, every single character storyline closed, and nothing left out to chance, or at least, nothing that I can recall. A marvelous conclusion, and a series I'll never forget; and neither will you, when you give it a chance.*** LOTR: The Return of the King (2003) is yet another superb adaptation, highly acclaimed, Oscar galore, my favorite of them all. 1000% EPIC, and maybe I'm selling it short. As always, extremely faithful to the book, although I never fail to remember that the Saruman and Grima ending at Hobbiton was *slightly* altered. And hats down to mighty Eowyn, who took down two oliphants, one nazgul, and nothing less than one immortal Witch King on top of all things, not to mention god knows how many orcs. Did I say it's Highly Recommendable? Probably not. (10/10) (EXTENDED edition)Goodbye my mangled Fellowship!

The Lord of the Rings-----------------------------------------------\"La reseña era sólo una cosa pequeña y pasajera: había likes y comentarios para siempre fuera de su alcance.\"Con Isengard derrotada, la Tierra Media logró un breve respiro; pero la guerra está lejos de terminar, mientras las innumerables hordas del señor oscuro Sauron se ciernen sobre Minas Tirith, último bastión de esperanza del Reino de los Hombres. Los quebrados restos de la Comunidad tratando de alcanzarla, antes de que sea reducida a escombros; y a la cabeza, Aragorn, último descendiente de una línea de reyes largamente olvidada, y masivamente superado en número. En tierras lejanas, los indefensos Frodo y Sam todavía intentando alcanzar el Monte del Destino, y a sólo un mal paso de ser capturados, y todo perdido.Esto es, el final de la línea. Tolkien guardando lo mejor para el final, terminando su obra con una conclusión de otro mundo para la trilogía que por siempre cambió la historia de la fantasía. Completamente cautivadora desde el principio hasta el final, de ritmo rápido, sobreabundantemente cargada de acción, imposible dejar de leer (excepto por las descripcione, canciones y poemas -ejem-), y enormemente emocional. Pero por sobre todo, 1000% EPICO.En esta entrega final conocemos extraordinarios lugares como Minas Tirith, las Montañas Blancas, Cirith Ungol, Mordor, y el Monte del Destino. –uy qué miedo! No muchos personajes nuevos entrando esta vez, pero sí muchos saliendo. Una multitud de momentos para el recuerdo.La Iluminación de las Balizas, el Paso de los Muertos, el Asedio de Gondor, la Cueva de Ungoliant, y el pequeño traspié en el Monte del Destino.Todas las preguntas respondidas, todo revelado, cada trama de personaje cerrada, y nada dejado al azar, o al menos, nada que pueda recordar. Una maravillosa conclusión, y una serie que nunca voy a olvidar; y tampoco tú, cuando le des una oportunidad.*** LOTR: El Retorno del Rey (2003) es otra sobresaliente adaptación, altamente galardonada, orgía de Oscars, mi favorita de todas. 1000% EPICA, y tal vez la estoy vendiendo corta. Como siempre, extremadamente fiel al libro, aunque nunca puedo dejar de olvidar que el final de Saruman y Grima en Hobbiton fue *levemente* alterado. Y todos los honores para la gran Eowyn, que acabó con dos olifantes, un nazgul, y nada menos que un inmortal Dios Brujo como si fuera poco, sin mencionar quien sabe cuanta cantidad de orcos. ¿Ya dije que es Altamente Recomendable? Probablemente no.

        "user_review": "Tolkien is the master of world building. With his writing comes generations of detailed history and lore. Middle Earth did not simply spring up overnight. Instead it is firmly established with the most thorough groundwork that is simply unmatched. And here his epic trilogy comes to an end. I���ve read it many times over the years, and reviewing it is no easy task. So, like my reviews of the first two books, I've picked out ten things I really love about the book. Spoilers ahead.1.The blade that was broken has been remade.\"From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.\"Aragorn never really felt kingly until he was given the sword of Elendil. His commanding presence became more than just a presence when he wielded the sword. We all knew it was coming, but it was great to see it happen nonetheless.2.The last of the stewardsWith the return of the kings also ushers in the end of the stewards. For all Boromir's weakness, and his father's madness, Faramir maintained his honour. Had he taken the ring for himself, the realms of men would have fallen. He played a pivotal role in the action, and his actions demonstrated that men are not as weak as the elves thought. His fate and future titles show such a thing.3.Théoden's SacrificeThere are many heroes within this trilogy, many men who give up their lives to vanquish evil. In spite of Gondor ignoring his calls for aid, in spite of Gondor watching Saruman ravish the lands of Rohan, Théoden still rides to her aid when his own lands are safe. He honours his pledge even when the one made to him was broken. Acting on the advice of Gandalf, he squashes his own hurt pride and rides for war because he understands what is at stake if he does not. Théoden was a true king and one the bravest men of this story. He knew what he rode to, but he went anyway.\"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!Fell deeds awake, fire and slaughter!spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!\"4.Girl Power!\"What do you fear, lady?\" [Aragorn] asked.\"A cage,\" [Éowyn] said. \"To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.\"There have not been many moments for women to show their strength in this story. Arwen's moment in the films was non-existent in the book. Frodo was saved on the river by an Elf-lord called Glorfindel. So when Eowen battled the Witch King, it is the first major moment Tolkien gave to a female hero. In a vastly male dominated genre, it was great to read this scene. If I have one criticism of Tolkien, it's that we didn't see more of such things.5.Golem's internal warGolem almost comes back into the light. He tries so very hard to conquer the ring, though ultimately it defeats him and he succumbs to its power. Had Frodo never been forced to betray Golem to Faramir inThe Two TowersI do think he would have stayed loyal. Perhaps he would have survived the events of this book. What do you think? Could he ever have been on the ships bound to the grey havens after all had done?6.The Siege of Minas TirithThis is probably one of the most exciting action sequences I've read in fiction. Sauron's hoard is unleashed in all its brutal fury, and the realms of men quake in its wake. Their defences are weak; their courage faltering, but they do have one weapon to stem the tide: the white rider. Terry Brooks loved it so much he copied the entire thing, or thereabouts, inThe Sword of Shannara.7.The Mouth of Sauron\"Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? Or indeed with wit to understand me?\"A massively unrepresented character on the screen and one who spent much of the third age waring the dwarves in the north and the elves of Mirkwood, The Mouth of Sauron is the vessel of Sauron's voice. Second only to the Nazgul in the command structure, The Mouth of Sauron is sent in to negotiate, threaten and persuade when more tact is required. Nazgul are clearly incapable of such a task, so it falls to him. I'd love to know more about this character, and his deeds, but his end at the Black Gate in the movie is most fitting. We can only presume that he also died there in the book, though there is no mention of his demise….8.Hobbit loyaltyFrodo: Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.Sam: Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun; I was being serious.Frodo: So was I.Sam saves Frodo so many times in this series. Whilst Frodo has the burden of the ring, Sam has the burden of Frodo. Without him Frodo would be dead, most likely murdered by Golem in his sleep or, if he made it that far alive, eaten by Shelob.9.The Hobbit warIn the films Saruman dies at Isengard. In the book he is imprisoned by Treebeard only to later convince him to let him escape. He and Wormtongue, in a senseless act of aggression, conquer the Shire. Such a situation allows for the Hobbits to show that they no longer need wizards or Kings to deal with their problems. They arrive back, rally their people, and crush the evil that has infected their home. Saruman, who only has the power of his voice at this point, dies in the action. All though this dragged the book out a bit, it was entirely necessary to show the growth of the characters after the story had ended.10.The Grey HavensIt also explains Frodo's decision to leave the Shire, something the movies fluffed up. The Shire is never the same, and any attempt to rebuild it will never make it feel like home for Frodo. He has gone through too much to go back to his old life. So he needs a new one, one where he can heal and attempt to put his past behind him. The beautiful lands to the west await him. I love this final image:\"But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.\"________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________"

I have finally finished readingThe Return of the King, the third and final part ofThe Lord of the Ringsby J.R.R. Tolkien; This means that I am officially done with Tolkien's main novels inThe Middle-Earthuniverse, and I'm proud of myself for it. I've read plenty of epic fantasy series more difficult and lengthy than this trilogy, you might be confused why I'm so proud of this. However, as I've mentioned in detail in my review forThe Fellowship of the Ring, after continuously putting the first book into my DNF pile, completing this trilogy felt immensely satisfying. Plus, no more gatekeepers—despite how many fantasy books I've read—would be able to accuse me of \"you're not a fantasy fans unless you've readThe Lord of the Rings\" anymore. And to be honest, if someone said this to you, you should just ignore them. That being said, now that I've finished this series, I will have to admit that Tolkien certainly earned his fame. The writing may not hold up too well for modern fantasy readers reading this for the first time now, but this being published more than sixty years ago? Truly amazing.Picture:Road to Mount Doomby Donato GiancolaThere's something magical and timeless in the themes told inThe Lord of the Rings, andThe Return of the Kingis the conclusion of it all. It is keeping the fire of hope burning even in the persisting and overwhelming darkness. Often we see underdogs and farmboys story as a cliché now, but as I repeatedly say, they became a cliché because they worked a LOT of times. In the end, it always depends on the execution of the narrative to make us care about the journey and characters of the story, but themes of hope and friendships—among many others—are extremely strong. I think we occassionally forget one very important thing about Frodo and Sam, and that is the fact that they are underdogs and unlikely heroes.\"I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam.\"Really ponder about it again; these Hobbits are unlikely heroes—small and bereft of any physical abilities except to eat so many times in a day—trying to do their best in the name of good, friendship, loyalty. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Eowyn, and all the other warriors, too—despite being separated from the Ring-bearers—believed with all their hearts that they will do what's right. Everything about it is so inspiring, and honestly, the friendship between Frodo and Samwise Gamgee is still one of the best friendships portrayed in a fantasy series. In addition to these,The Return of the Kingalso put Eowyn into the spotlight of the narrative, and I LOVED it; Tolkien has created one of the most iconic scenes in fantasy with what Eowyn achieved in this book.\"But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am, Éomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.\"I also think that bothThe TowersandThe Return of the Kingwere far easier and engaging to read thanThe Fellowship of the Ring. The dialogues—excluding their constant use of odd \"Good-bye!\" and outdated words—between characters were compelling, filled with unforgettable passages, and the songs were much fewer, too. Most importantly, though, there's no more Tom Bombadil; despite many fans' love for this character which I don't think I'll ever understand, I seriously found Bombadil to be so out of place in this trilogy. There's one thing in this book that I wish more newly released fantasy books would still include in their final installment: long epilogue. I love reading long epilogue or \"after the battle\" chapters. Obviously, I don't mean for an epilogue chapter to be as long—the Scouring chapter near the end was so bizarre—as the one featured in this book, but I'm actually surprised that many people hate long epilogues. Personally, after so many battles and destructions, I would love to know about the characters' fate after the conflict ended rather than just saying bye-bye then immediately in one or two short chapters. Sometimes, it feels like the story ended before I even got to say goodbye to the characters.\"It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.\"In my opinion, the most disappointing elements from this trilogy were the action sequences. I've said this before in my review ofThe Two Towers, Tolkien really didn't focus his writing on the action sequences. As someone who utterly loved the movies and the epic battles, the battle scenes in these books were inferior and too short to my liking. I enjoyed reading the build-up and preparations for the battles, but I didn't get the explosive impact from reading the war scenes themselves. The battle sequences in the films and the official/fan-arts conjured out of the movies/text are by far superior to the prose version, in my opinion. In the movie adaptation, the Battle of Helm's Deep inThe Two Towersand the Battle of the Pelennor Fields inThe Return of the Kingwere stunningly incredible and jaw-dropping. I can't say the same about the books; I've read a LOT of fantasy books that have better battle/war scenes.Picture:The Witch Kingby Chris RahnAfter all said and done, I think the answer to whether I love the books or the films more is crystal clear.The Return of the Kingis a classic and wonderful conclusion to Tolkien's legendary series. I will not deny the importance of Tolkien and this series in shaping and popularizing the fantasy genre, that would be insane.The Lord of the Ringsis a great trilogy, but I think the writing is a bit outdated now for modern fantasy readers reading this for the first time. I definitely loved the movies more, and I do believe thatThe Children of Hurinis Tolkien's best—and darkest—story. But who knows? I have a feeling I'll reread this trilogy someday, and I might end up lovingThe Lord of the Ringsmore on reread.\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\"Series review:The Fellowship of the Ring:4/5 starsThe Two Towers:4.5/5 starsThe Return of the King:4.5/5 starsThe Lord of the Rings:13/15 starsYou can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Alya, Annabeth, Devin, Hamad, Jimmy Nutts, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas, Zoe."

And it is impossible to convey to the new reader all the qualities of this series. It's just epic, monstrous, and the tale develops amazingly. Characters, even in an imaginary world, stood absolutely convincing in their details. This story tells- how even insignificant people can change the course of the future through love and doing the right deeds.I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.Precious."

        "user_review": "I´ll just wear the ring one more, last, short time, and then really go to rehabLetting the established storylines collide in an epic culminationThat´s what most fantasy, no matter if high, science, or dark, series keep doing, no matter if it are 3, 5, or 10 parts. Tolkien accelerates the story engine towards an end that has already been prepared and enabled in the first 2 parts of the series, letting it feel like one, big piece. Another genre milestone that escalates to ridiculous lengths and perfection in many fantasy series and makes them so addictive.The big longtime impact is uncomparable to other genresOf course, sci fi and horror have their prodigies and milestones too, but they can go and splitter in many different subgenres, focus on psychological elements with characterization, or just epic battle and splatter, but fantasy is extremely genre standard focused regarding what to deliver and hasn´t that much room for experiments, kind of traditional in what it should deliver. And Tolkien set the standards for it, showed how to do it, and helped to inspire the production of dozens of great series, hundreds of average ones, and an innumerable amount of fanfiction. Of course, his inspiration came from the millennia of storytelling that formed the works he took for his reinterpretations, so any aspiring fantasy author could see her/himself as an ancestor of a tradition to not just pass the stories themselves. But the much more important part, the ability to tell them, to use tropes and creative writing to hypnotize readers and eat away their lifetime with multi k behemoths of fantasy series.Bromance gets tragicThe, some may say a bit too intense gaytrix style, Frodo Sam relationships gets tragic, because as so often with substance abuse, both body and soul get ruined by it and the ones who suffer are family and friends. One could go one more meta step and say that it´s not just addiction, but ideological contamination too, that extremism and faith poison the minds of normally friendly people who carry their toxicity home and make living together hell. Because, all in all, it´sFascism crushed by united, different fractions that understand that they´re just powerful together as one population of Middle earth, no matter how small and hairy or angular eared they may be.Another heavy one, the ending can be seen in many different ways, from just a megalomaniac battle overkill to the deeper meanings of the journeys that make the victory of the good ones possible. Or that everyday people don´t understand the power they could have if they would work together against a dictatorship, economic inequality, and grievances. Or that the evil is still lurking in everyone and that it takes a permanent struggle to keep the peace by controlling the inner demons. Endless interpretations until eternity beyond the straight road to Aman.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "The Return of the King is, along with The Children of Húrin, my favorite work of Tolkien. It's one of my comfort reads. No one wrote about friendship and love quite like the late professor. Sam and Frodo. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Merry and Pippin. Bilbo and Gandalf. Frodo and Gandalf. All those friendships are near and dear to my heart.This world may be imaginary, but its characters feel very real. Most of us aspire to be as pure as Frodo, brave as Sam and Aragorn, cool as Legolas, and wise as Gandalf. Who doesn't admire the fearless Éowyn or the just Faramir? Or my personal favorite; the mighty and selfless Elf-lord Glorfindel. (Glorfindel also appeared in The Silmarillion)There has been a lot of drama surrounding LOTR these past few months. The new Amazon series has caused a divide among fans of Tolkien. That's why I chose to re-read this book. I wanted to purge myself from the negativity and remind myself why I fell in love with this world in the first place. These are some of my all-time favorite books and movies. Middle-earth is my happy place. Well, Rivendell, Lothlórien, Shire, Gondor, and Rohan are my happy places. I have no wish to visit Mordor or Angmar.One of the things I cherish the most is the romance between Faramir and Éowyn, as well as Aragorn and Arwen. Those are some of my favorite couples, along with Beren and Lúthien; and Angrod and Andreth. Perhaps my favorite part of the book is in the appendices. 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen' is a must-read. It's as bittersweet as it is beautiful.*spoilers*And thus it was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long parting; and as he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras Galadhon laden with flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom appointed.Then for a season they wandered together in the glades of Lothlórien, until it was time for him to depart. And on the evening of Midsummer Aragorn, Arathorn's son, and Arwen daughter of Elrond went to the fair hill, Cerin Amroth, in the midst of the land, and they walked unshod on the undying grass with elanor and niphredil about their feet. And there upon that hill they looked east to the Shadow and west to the Twilight, and they plighted their troth and were glad.And Arwen said: \"Dark is the Shadow, and yet my heart rejoices, for you, Estel, shall be among the great whose valour will destroy it.\"But Aragorn answered: \"Alas, I cannot foresee it, and how it may come to pass is hidden from me. Yet with your hope I will hope. And the Shadow I utterly reject. But neither, lady, is the Twilight for me; for I am mortal, and if you cleave to me, Evenstar, then the Twilight you must also renounce.\"And she stood then as still as a white tree, looking into the West, and at last she said: \"I will cleave to you, Dúnadan, and turn from the Twilight. Yet there lies the land of my people and the long home of all my kin.\" She loved her father dearly.Arwen and Aragorn's love story resembles that of Lúthien and Beren. Arwen is often compared to Lúthien by her people. Just like Lúthien, she gave her love to a mortal. Though she never regretted her choice, Aragorn's death left her heartbroken.\"But Arwen went forth from the House, and the light of her eyes was quenched, and it seemed to her people that she had become cold and grey as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Then she said farewell to Eldarion, and to her daughters, and to all whom she had loved; and she went out from the city of Minas Tirith and passed away to the land of Lórien, and dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter came. Galadriel had passed away and Celeborn also was gone, and the land was silent.'There at last when the mallorn-leaves were falling, but spring had not yet come, she laid herself to rest upon Cerin Amroth; and there is her green grave, until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten by men that come after, and elanor and niphredil bloom no more east of the Sea.\"Tragic as it is, it's something we must all face.The love story of Éowyn and Faramir is no less beautiful. These two are perfect for each other. When I tell you I fangirled, I fangirled.And Éowyn looked at Faramir long and steadily; and Faramir said: 'Do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Éowyn! But I do not offer you my pity. For you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten; and you are a lady beautiful, I deem, beyond even the words of the Elven-tongue to tell. And I love you. Once I pitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear or any lack, were you the blissful Queen of Gondor, still I would love you. Éowyn, do you not love me?'Then the heart of Éowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her.'I stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun,' she said; 'and behold! the Shadow has departed! I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.' And again she looked at Faramir. 'No longer do I desire to be a queen,' she said.Then Faramir laughed merrily. 'That is well,' he said; 'for I am not a king. Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will. And if she will, then let us cross the River and in happier days let us dwell in fair Ithilien and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, if the White Lady comes.''Then must I leave my own people, man of Gondor?' she said. 'And would you have your proud folk say of you: \"There goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of the North! Was there no woman of the race of Númenor to choose?\"'I would,' said Faramir. And he took her in his arms and kissed her under the sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the sight of many.Most people say Sam is the true hero of the story. I don't think there is only one hero. Everyone shines equally. No other writer could have created this masterpiece other than Tolkien."

That second book tricked me into thinking this last one was going to be, I don't know, fast-paced & action-y?Not so much. It was actually quite long. In fact, I didn't think it was ever going to end. And then once itdidend and that ring got dumped off into a volcano and they beat Sauron back?It kept going.I shit you not, there is an entire fake history lesson written into the back of the book.Alright. The best way I can describe the lastTWO HOURSof the audiobook version of this is to say that it reminded me of those books in the Bible where so-n-so begat so-n-so.You know what I'm talking about?Yeah, so two fucking hours of made-up names of kings and their made-up kingdoms and a snippet of something these people did.I HONESTLY COULD NOT HAVE CARED ANY LESS.By the end of it, I really felt like I could have used a Sam to drag my ass across the finish line.But I didn't have a brave little Hobbit who loved me, so I just had to put my head down and plow through this shit.PS - all of you who told me there was some awesome love story between Aragorn and Arwen?Fuck you guys. That was awful and I can't believe I was looking forward to reading that. What iswrongwith you people?!Legolas and Gimli had a better love story with a much happier ending. And the thing is, I really thought I'd like Sam & Frodo more, but they were both just too weepy for my taste. As far as buddies went, I was team Gimli & Legolas all the way.A big part of my frustration with this last book is that there were just so. many. unnecessary. conversations.That time Aragorn had a 30 minute discussion about herbs with the healers who didn't know what that herb was that he needed to heal all the people with theblack shadow sickness. The scene went on and on and on as he talked to one old ladynay, me lord! I didn't know whatthefuckever herb was good for healing!and then he talks to the top healer dude who sayswe only use whatthefuckever to occasionally to make sick rooms smell better, sire.and then he has to shake his head sadly and then and get people to run around looking for it and then they find some of it but it's a few weeks old and it turns out that 3 week old whatthefuckever is still good enough to heal the folks...And then he makes a joke about how silly all the healers were later. <--Ahahahahaha!Yes. It was hilarious that you wasted all that time talking about an insignificant herb!Move it along, sir.Good stuff?1) The friendships.There was a lot more hugging and kissing and crying than I thought there would be in a tale about a bunch of dudes. It was sweet. And it was nice to see such deep feelings expressed between men (and elves and dwarves and Ents and horses).2) Eowyn.She was cool and badass and all the things. If the whole book had been about her, I think I would have liked it a lot more.3) Really it was just Eowyn.Sorry.I wanted to love this, and I went into book 3 with the best of intentions. I swear. I didn't read it just to dump on the world's most beloved fantasy novel. I still respect the hell out of the entire trilogy even though I really can't say that I liked it or enjoyed it much.And Idefinitelydon't regret finally finishing this and ticking it off of my bucket list.Well worth it to know the story that spawned a thousand more stories.Recommended for people who like this stuff."

Bring snacks.❗️Note: there are much more scholarly reviews available out there, so if that interests you, I would refer you to reviews like this one:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...or the official Tolkien Society:https://www.tolkiensociety.org/That being said, I hope my layman approach is enjoyable for most 😉Aragorn: \"For Frodo.\"Holy Gimli son of Glóin, I loved this book! Tolkien is a demigod when it comes to worldbuilding and storytelling. You would be hard-pressed to find any fantasy novel that reaches the level of his imagination and literacy. I wouldn't say the book is perfect, but the races he includes with their various languages expressed in song and poem, and the references to internal lore of past events, can make you forget that you're reading high fantasy instead of a true, historical retelling of an epic past.Whenever I read a narrative story, I consciously try and suspend all disbelief to fully live inside the world presented, which can often result in disappointment. But when a novel is well-written and believable, well, there's no better way to experience a book in my view. Tolkien doesn't disappoint, and at no time did he pull my attention away from my quest through middle earth as an integral member of the Fellowship of the Ring.\"Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it'll shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something.\"Who could ask for a better, more loyal friend than Sam? But when developing characters, how do you keep them from becoming too perfect? Well Sam would definitely fit into the \"too perfect\" category if it weren't for the masterful way in which his strengths and flaws equalize. We all love Sam because he has the qualities of superhuman friendship and devotion we all wish for, yet he lacks confidence in his own decisions which makes us empathize with him.Despite his weaknesses, through the novels, Sam becomes more the focus of the story as Frodo fades into a singular mentality of resisting the ring. In the act of protecting his master, he finds within himself the inner strength to make difficult decisions of protection. He staves off Golumn for some time, carries the ring and saves Frodo from the Tower of Cirith Ungol, and even carries Frodo up the side of Mount Doom at the end of their quest. By the conclusion of the novel, Sam is a true hero after the Battle of Bywater and is elected Mayer of the Shire for seven consecutive years. We see the hero's journey not as much through Frodo as through Sam.\"I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone.\"I should mention the return of the king since this book is, in fact, titled \"The Return of the King.\" 😜 Strider/Aragorn, who we all know and love, unlike the movies, accepts his true calling from the beginning as becoming future King of Gondor. He is honorable and fearless in fighting for good and comes into his calling when needed. Plus, he gets to marry his one true love, Arwen, which is like the greatest love story of all time!The Battle of the Pelennor Fields (which is the battle at Minas Tirith), was better in the movie than in the book, as the battle in the book was relatively short and unsatisfying in comparison to an epic CGI final battle sequence, but this is just my opinion. Most often, action in movies is a disappointment without an engaging accompanying storyline, and even then, I just tend to endure them. But some movies hit the sweet spot and it changes my whole perspective. The battles in the LoTR movies did just that, creating realistic, epic battle sequences bolstering the books. Bravo, Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema for a job well done!\"Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\"Conclusion: Gandalf, Legolas, Bilbo, Gimli, Saruman, Galadriel, Elrond, Peregrin, Meriadoc, Golumn, and many other characters were left out of this review who are just as important and interesting as the ones mentioned. Some people find the books tedious, which I can agree with at some points, but there is still an appreciation that can be found through each section alongside the more exciting elements. The level of detail in each individual description of the world around the travelers and knowing that everything is consistent with the overarching lore, can be appreciated as no small feat. So, I'm just saying, give the books their due diligence or risk missing out on one of the greatest epics of all time! 😃"

Then, when we're done with all of the series, it's very hard not to wish that it doesn't end here - but will go on for many more days. This is what I felt exactly with the The Lord of The Ring trilogy. What a wonderful journey has it been?. Each volume delivering parts of an incredible, perfectly put story.Tolkien's Middle Earth is, without any doubt, one of the most detailed, well thought-out, unique, imaginative and wonderful fantasy worlds I have ever come across. And when you place the thrilling plot within this world, what we have is a timeless creation, and one that does not identify any age limit. Starting with the first book, it only ascends in every positive way, never reaching any plateau.\"I'm not used, Master Beregond, to waiting hungry on others while they ear. It is a sore trial for a hobbit, that.\"Before finishing, it feels incomplete if I stop without any reference to the trilogy of movies. I think, movies were amazing on their own, while the best changes applied to plot but without any negative impacts to the story. However, the differences are quite significant in the last of the three. Almost the last third is dedicated to the conclusion of the book. Obviously, a movie might not do very well if it's taking a long time beyond the peak of excitement. But Tolkien do the reader justice by continuing with a very fulfilling end with no detail spared.If one have not read The Lord of The Rings, he or she is missing out literally a world of excitement.\"Rohan had come at last.\""

        "user_review": "The last stand for the control of Middle-Earth!I WENT TO MIDDLE-EARTH AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS CRUMMY RINGThat's the message in a t-shirt that I got in a tourism travel (and I still have it!). I thought that it was appropiate to begin my review about the third part and final ofLord of the Rings.All that fuzz about a ring that can turn you invisible? You may think, but that was the least of its properties. Its major use was being able to control of the rest of ring-bearers with it, and if you think about that many of the most powerful beings in the Middle-Earth possessed a ring, well, it seems logical why all that fuzz. Moreover, a factor that not usually is pondered is that The One Ring also helps to extend the lifetime of a being to an absurd expanse, and since Sauron is just a \"shadow\" of his past self, it's evident why he needed The One Ring so bad.I commented in my review of the first part,The Fellowship of the Ring, about my theory of the plans of The One Ring. Not Sauron's. Not Saruman's. But the One Ring. It was obsessed about the Hobbits, since they were the last bastion of pure goodness in the whole Middle-Earth. Without making any spoilers, I am kinda sad that while it wasn't due actions of The One Ring, bute vil powers damaged that idyllic of a more simple life. Also, I think that the whole thing was unnecessary to the main story and even over-extending the tale kinda ruining the \"final\" climax of the war.Back, inThe Hobbit, Bilbo's first act having The One Ring was……piety.A small noble deed that would define the fate of the whole Middle-Earth.That makes you think about it. Each action has a consequence. Maybe you won't be able to realize the consequence, but it's clear that you have to think about your actions, since you never know that something that you may consider irrelevant, even correct, it may lead to consequences with epic importance.ÉOWYN & GALADRIEL, MIDDLE-EARTH GIRL POWERAgain, I won't spoil anything, I only can say that one of my favorite female characters in the saga is Éowyn, along with Galadriel. Their paths are separate, they are different kind of female characters, but definitely, they proved their own importance and vital roles in this story plenty of male characters.Galadriel's role was centered mainly in the first part (but you'll find her here again),The Fellowship of the Ring, and you can't doubt that she, along with Elrond (one of my favorite male characters), both are of the most powerful beings in the Middle-Earth, where their existence over there, defined the beginning and the end of the Third Age.Éowyn was introduced on the second part,The Two Towers, but it's on the third and final part,The Return of the King, where she plays her vital role in an age where men were the ones usually in the battlefields.It's clear that a predilect theme of J.R.R. Tolkien was to show that while wars are things to avoid if possible, if the war is inescapable, it's short-sighted and close-minded not considering the worth and courage of the \"unlikely\" beings (Hobbits, women) and including them into the ranks of the defending army. Since many times the tall and strong men don't think that people of small height or from the \"weaker sex\", can be valuable during a war. But you can testify that in \"The War of the Ring\", four Hobbits and a woman, changed the course of it, during epic moments of impossible odds.LEGACY OF THE LORD OF THE RINGSThe saga ends here,Return of the King, at least the main story, because certainly you can find aLOTmore of tales in the other books by Tolkien set in the Middle-Earth.And it's indisputable the legacy caused by this story.SinceALLthe following novels and book series in the genre of epic fantasy are inspired and/or influenced due the publication ofLord of the Rings, but its impact isn't limited to this literary genre, since if you know what to look or watching carefully you'll find plots, elements, concepts, etc… of this story in other novels of different genres, in films, in TV, etc…Once you woud be aware of this story, you keep noticing here and there, the influence and impact of it.Not matter if you likeLord of the Ringsor not, you have to thank anyway, since the imagination and creativity in the minds of artists in the whole world, in all kind of art fields, were never the same after the publication of this work. They got better.Thank you, Tolkien."

He had these beautiful hardback books with fold-out maps. I had heard of the hobbit and saw the cartoon as a kid. I thought it was an okay movie, but it didn't really impress me. He convinced me that I needed to read this. So, I started with the hobbit and read one book after the other until I was done with this book.I remember being awed by this series. I couldn't wait for the last book. The world was so grand and epic. I loved the race of elves and the Ents. I tore through this story as fast as I could go. I read the appendix not being able to get enough. I was hooked on this series. I had a major book hangover and it was a bit sad not to have anymore story. I did go on to read the Silmarillion a bit later.I felt like this was an amazing ending to a beloved series. I loved the whole story. I think it will be time for a re-read soon. The movies are stellar and the written story still has so much details to offer. I love a soft-magic system, they are the best."

Mount Doom is far away spilling noxious fumes the Dark Tower always alert and Suron's eye never sleeps in desolate Mordor, but the lethal roads become longer and longer and harder to reach, as creepy creatures in the night roam ...however the one ring flows with evil, nobody can resist its power the contamination dominates the beings who posses it, these unfortunates suffer. Gollum a prime example not good maybe, still an unique character which fiction cannot top... you love and hate, however want him to survive... Armies of orcs and ruffian men, march through middle-earth conquering, seemingly invincible and devastating the entire territory, friends butchered and the fellowship the only hope for salvation.Terror nevertheless grips the people, the mood thickens to despair and rumors of the villain Saruman thriving in the beloved Shire of the Hobbits brings concern. Numerous evils are sure to arrive there... in the quiet place. Welcome to the end of the novels, they are a little bit of heaven that we are sure to remember fondly. I will miss the wonderful hobbits and the enchanting customs of the shire, a beautiful place which sadly doesn't exist, but should, in a hole in the ground...Both glorious and a sad story, since no more by the author will be produced..."

        "user_review": "The end of an epic!The Return of the Kingbrings a conclusion to the wonderful Lord of the Rings trilogy and is one of the most satisfying conclusions to a long tale that has ever been written.In this book, we leave Frodo and Sam in Mordor and rejoin Pippin and Gandalf, Merry and Theoden, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as the suspense builds towards the final battle. Gandalf has a hard time explaining the death of Boromir to the grieving father Denethor who will have a sad ending himself as things turn out. Definitely, Denethor was one of the characters I liked the least.Denethor's daughter Eowyn falls in love with Aragorn (who is, unfortunately, already betrothed to an Elf princess and thus not fair game) but wishes to fight:'Shall I always be chosen?' she said bitterly. 'Shall I always be left behind when Riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and find food and beds when they return?''What do you fear, lady?' [Aragorn] asked.'A cage,' she said. 'To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.'(p. 767 - note that the page numbers are from the single-volume edition of LOTR). This is perhaps an attempt by Tolkien to excuse his male-centric story and express his sympathy for the cause of women's equality. Indeed, one of the greatest moments in the entire trilogy is when Eowyn rises above her station and becomes the unique female hero of the saga as she strikes down the Night King, \"But no living man am I. You look upon a woman!\" It was truly a fantastic and inspiring moment. Galadriel was an interesting female character too, but other than glowing in the dark and handing out cool swag to passers-by, she was just a pretty hood ornament compared to Eowyn.I found it curious how they call Sauron 'The Nameless One', notably a source for Rowling having various HP characters use this moniker for her bad guy.Unforgettable as well as moments of suspense when the Lord of the Nazgûl seems about to strike Gandalf as Rohan arrives on the theatre of battle changing the momentum (p. 811).After the battle, there is a beautiful moment on the city walls as Eowyn and Faramir are united just as the Ring is destroyed. It is as scene of romance and yet Tolkien pulls it off without it becoming too sentimental and yet remaining epic. Fantastic writing.neither wind, nor voice, nor bird-call, nor rustle of leaf, nor their own breath could be heard; the very beating of their hearts was stilled. Time halted. And as they stood so, their hands met and clasped, though they did not know it. And still they waited for they knew what not....A sounds like a sign went up from all the lands about them, and their hearts beat suddenly again.(p. 945)After the battle, there is another nature moment where we see a seedling of Galathilion, Eldest of Treesalready it had put forth young leaves long and shapely, dark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow.(p. 950) Few writers capture a love of nature with such poetic precision as Tolkien.On the trip back, as folks peel off like leaves of corn, we cross a broken - but not toothless as shall be seen - Saruman in a comic scene (p. 960-961). But, when all that is left are the hobbits, they arrive to find the Shire changed and under the terror of a violent band of ruffians - the remnants of the armies of Saruman and Sauron. Symbolically, I believe that the Scouring of the Shire represents both the lost idealism in Europe after World War I (as well as the horrors of World War II which was raging as he was writing the original text. He edited the final draft for years before finally publishing in 1955) as well as the damage to the idyllic environment by the Industrialization of England in the XIXe century. Perhaps, Tolkien couldn't resist describing a last piece of bitter loss before ending his epic with the fantastically beautiful sending off from Grey Haven.They've cut it down! cried Sam. 'They've cut down the Party Tree!' He pointed to where the tree had stood unde which Bilbo had made his Farewell Speech. It was lying lopped and dead in the field. As if this was the last straw Sam burst into tears.(p. 993) Personally, I think that this was a result of Tolkien's personal disillusionment during the Battle of Britain seeing bombs falling from the sky hitting buildings and trees he loved in and around Oxford. Beautifully, however, Sam quickly turns his frown upside down and sets out to rebuild what is left of the Shire.We then get one last ride together as Elrond, Galadriel, Frodo, Bilbo and Frodo all ride off on boats literally into the sunset in probably the most beautiful literary sendoff that I have ever read (p. 1006-1008)The Third Age was over, and the Days of the Ring were passed, and an end was come of the story and song of those times.The Elves were leaving Middle Earth for good - an image (and homage) to our childhood dreams retreating into our memory as we become adults and shed our infancy. Sam, arriving to his house with his wife Rose, firmly rooted in his earthly life ends the book thus:He drew a deep breath. 'Well, I'm back,' he said.LOTR is hard to summarize in words because all of it is so over-the-top, so epic, and so deeply influential on all fantasy literature in the seven decades since it was written. We are all highly indebuted to Tolkien for his beautiful and youthful text. If only we had all collectively paid more attention to his ecological message and preserved our environment to the same degree that we extended his storytelling legacy.Fino's Tolkien Reviews:The HobbitThe Fellowship of the Ring (LOTR 1)The Two Towers (LOTR 2)The Return of the King (LOTR 3)Lord of the Rings 1-3 - General Comments and ObservationsRaymond Edward's Tolkien biography"

        "user_review": "The Return of the Kingis the final part of the trilogy where the fellowship marks its victory over the Dark Lord, Sauron. The one ring that rules, and the one ring that binds the world in darkness has met its end in fire of the Mount Doom where it was made. The quest is completed, and Sauron is completely defeated. He will never bind the Middle-Earth with his spells of darkness and evil forces. The King of the West is crowned and thus begins the Third Age where men dominate and glorify the earth. And the fellowship officially breaks never to be formed on Middle-Earth.This third part of the Tolkien masterpiece is the best of the three, not only because it marks the grand victorious ending, but also because of its sense of completeness. There is ample suspense and more character development in the fellowship and the other warriors who showed such strength of character, wisdom, and courage in the face of the greatest peril. The moving writing brings battles, the destruction and barrenness of land, and the despair and hopelessness into life. The thematic expressions of friendship, love, and loyalty displayed among the characters are more tested here than in the previous stories. And the victory (the fall of Sauron as well as the final defeat of Saruman in Hobbiton) crowns it all. The emotional ride of the reader from uneasiness to downright fear, from despair to hope, and from joy at the victory to sad parting engages the full attention though somewhat taxing to the mind. But that's the beauty of Tolkien's mastery. He doesn't tell us a story; he makes us part of it.Tolkien's writing parallels no other. I've said this already in my reviews of the first two parts, but I still like to reiterate it here. Words fail me to say how much I love and admire his writing. His words completely transport me into another world although it may not always be charming. And while I read it, I have no sense of the present, being so lost in the world he creates. Tolkien is a master of the creative art, and this trilogy is a masterpiece beyond comparison.This trilogy is one of the best works I've ever read. Those who have read it will quite agree with me. You find rare gems belonging to the literary realm from time to time. And this is undoubtedly one of the rarest ones."

        "user_review": "Writers who inspire a genre are usually misunderstood. Tolkien's reasons for writing were completely unlike those of the authors he inspired. He didn't have an audience, a genre, and scores of contemporaries. There was a tradition of high adventure fairy tales, as represented by Eddison, Dunsany, Morris, MacDonald, Haggard, and Kipling, but this was only part of what inspired Tolkien.His writing was chiefly influenced by his familiarity with the mythological traditions of the Norse and Welsh cultures. While he began by writing a fairy story with The Hobbit andother early drafts, his later work became a magical epic along the lines of the Eddas. As a translator, Tolkien was intimately knowledgeable with these stories, the myths behind them, and the languages that underpinned them, and endeavored to recreate their form.Contrarily, those who have followed in his footsteps since have tended to be inspired by a desire to imitate him. Yet they failed to do what Tolkien did because they did not have a whole world of mythic tradition, culture, and language to draw on. They mimicked his style, but did not understand his purpose, and hence produced merely empty facsimiles.If they had copied merely the sense of wonder or magnificence, then they might have created perfectly serviceable stories of adventure, but they also copied those parts of Tolkien which do not fit a well-built, exciting story--like his work's sheer length. Tolkien made it 'okay' for writers of fantasy to produce books a thousand pages long, and to write many of them in succession. Yet Tolkien's length had a purpose, it was not merely an affectation.Tolkien needed this length in order to reproduce myth. The Eddas were long and convoluted because they drew from many different stories and accounts, combined over time by numerous story-tellers and eventually compiled by scribes. The many digressions, conflicts, repetitions, asides, fables, songs, and minutiae of these stories came together organically. Each had a purpose, even if they didn't serve the story, they were part of a grand and strange world. Epics often served as encyclopedias for their age, teaching history, morals, laws, myth, and geography--as may be seen in Homer or The Bible.This was the purpose of all of Tolkien's long, dull songs, the litany of troop movements, the lines of lineage, the snippets of didactic myths, and side-adventures. To create a realistically deep and complicated world, he felt he needed to include as many diverging views as the original myths had. He was being true to a literary convention--though not a modern one, and not one we would call a 'genre'.He gave characters similar names to represent other historical traditions: that of common prefixes or suffixes, of a house line adopting similar names for fathers, sons, and brothers. An author who copies this style without that linguistic and cultural meaning just makes for a confusing story, breaking the sensible rule that main characters should not have similar names.Likewise, in a well-written story, side-characters should be kept to the minimum needed to move the plot and entertain the reader with a variety of personalities. It is another rule Tolkien breaks, because he is not interested in an exciting, driving pace. He wants the wealth of characters to match the number of unimportant side characters one would expect from a historical text.The only reason he sometimes gets away with breaking such sensible rules of storytelling is that he often has a purpose for breaking them, and is capable of drawing on his wealth of knowledge to instill further depth and richness in his world. Sometimes, when he slowed his story down with such asides, they did not have enough purpose to merit inclusion, a flaw in pacing which has only increased with modern authors.But underneath all of that, Tolkien does have an appealing and exciting story to tell, of war and succession and moral struggles--the same sort of story that has been found in our myths since the very earliest writings of man. He does not create a straight monomyth, because, like Milton, he presents a hero divided. Frodo takes after the Adam, placing strength in humility and piety, not martial might or wit. Aragorn is an attempt to save the warlike, aristocratic hero whom Milton criticized in his portrayal of Satan.Yet unlike Satan, we do not get an explanation of what makes Strider superior, worthy, or--more importantly--righteous. And in this, Tolkien's attempt to recreate the form of the Eddas is completely at odds with the Christian, romantic moral content with which he fills the story. This central schism makes his work much less true to the tradition than Anderson'sThe Broken Sword, which was published the same year.Not only does Tolkien put forth a vision of chaste, humble, 'everyman' heroes who persevere against temptation through piety, he also presents a world of dualistic good and evil, of eternal, personal morality, prototypical of the Christian worldview, particularly the post-Miltonic view. His characters are bloodless, chaste, and noble--and if that nobility is sometimes that of simple, hard-working folk, all the better for hisMerrie Englandanalogue.More interesting than these is his portrayal of Gollum, one of the few characters with a deep psychological contradiction. In some ways, his central, conflicted role resemblesEddison's Lord Gro, whose work inspired Tolkien. But even this internal conflict is dualistic. Unlike Gro, Gollum is not a character with an alternative view of the world, but fluctuates between the hyperbolic highs and lows of Tolkien's morality.It is unfortunate that both good and evil seem to be external forces at work upon man, because it removes much of the agency and psychological depth of the characters. There is a hint of very alien morality in the out-of-place episode of Tom Bombadil, expressing the separation between man and fairy thatDunsany's workepitomized. Bombadil is the most notorious remainder of the fantastical roots of Tolkien's story which he painstakingly removed in editing in favor of Catholic symbology.Yet despite internal conflicts, there is something respectable in what he achieved, and no fantasy author has yet been capable of comprehending what Tolkien was trying to do and innovating upon it. The best modern writers of fantasy have instead avoided Tolkien, concentrating on other sources of inspiration. The dullards of fantasy have merely rehashed and reshuffled the old tropes back and forth, imagining that they are creating something.One cannot entirely blame Tolkien because Jordan, Martin, Goodkind, Paolini, Brooks, and Salvatore have created a genre out of his work which is unoriginal, cloying, escapist, and sexually unpalatable (if often successful). At least when Tolkien is dull, ponderous, and divergent, he is still achieving something.These authors are mostly trying to fix a Tolkien they don't understand, trying to make him easy to swallow. The uncomfortable sexuality is an attempt to repair the fact that Tolkien wrote a romance where the two lovers are thousands of miles apart for most of the story. Even a libertine like me appreciates Tolkien's chaste, distant, longing romance more than the obsessively fetishistic consummation that has come to define sexuality in the most repressive and escapist genre this side of four-color comic books.I don't think Tolkien is a great writer, I don't even think he is one of the greater fantasy writers. He was a stodgy old Tory, and the Shire is his false golden age of 'Merrie Olde England'. His romance wasn't romantic, and his dualistic moralizing cheapened the story. His attempt to force Christian theology onto a heroic epic is as problematic and conflicted as monks' additions to Beowulf.Tolkien's flaws have been well-documented by notable authors, from Moorcock's'Epic Pooh'to Mieville'sadroit analysis, but for all that, he was no slouch. Even if we lament its stolid lack of imagination,The Lord of the Ringsis the work of a careful and deliberate scholar of language, style, and culture. It is the result of a lifetime of collecting and applying knowledge, which is a feat to behold.Each time the moon is mentioned, it is in the proper phase as calculated from the previous instance. Calendar dates and distances are calculated. Every name mentioned has a meaning and a past. I have even heard that each description of a plant or stone was carefully researched to represent the progression of terrain, though I can find no support for this theory.Yet what good is that to a story? It may be impressive as a thought exercise, but to put that much time and work into the details instead of fixing and streamlining the frame of the story itself seems entirely backwards to me. But for all thatThe Lord of the Ringsmay be dull, affected, and moralistic, it is Tolkien's, through and through.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"

After reading the first two books in this series, how can you not finish it with this one? I knocked them back between 9th and 10th grades, loving every minute of the imagination and struggle between good and evil. When I got this this final one, I already knew I'd be sad to say goodbye to all the characters I'd fallen hardcore for over the 1500 pages between the volumes. But when the movies came out, I had a chance to re-live the intensity of this drama... as taking on such large books with everything else I had on my reading plate, did not make sense. Watching them in film form tho lived up to many expectations. Of course, I loved the books more, but I still enjoyed the films and will watch them if I am skimming the channels and find one in play...The flaws in each of the characters, as well as their journey, are immense but real. When you find out some of the changes in this book (no spoilers!) and people you thought were long-forgotten, it is brilliant. And seeing the evil forces fight the good forces... it's just a version of the reality we face every day. All over a ring that provides power. But power is at the center of it all. And it's one of the few books where I found myself happy with the ending.I could talk about these forever, but I won't bore you. I am not a big fan of fantasy, and have only read a handful of books and authors in this genre. These are a favorite across all genres for me, and it's because of the creativity in Tolkien's mind that I consider reading more in this genre. Before Harry Potter, we had a family of hobbits... who stole our hearts and taught us many lessons. Ones I still think of today whenever I need to weight the options before me. Please give them a chance! But start with #1.... you have to read them in order!About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

        "user_review": "The return of a rightful king to the long-empty throne of Gondor is at the heart of this third and final volume of J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Rings– as is, of course, the conclusion of the quest to destroy the One Ring of Power, the utterly evil superweapon with which the Dark Lord Sauron had hoped to plunge all of the world of Middle-Earth into everlasting moral darkness.In the preceding volumes ofThe Lord of the Rings– Part One,The Fellowship of the Ring, and Part Two,The Two Towers– Tolkien had created a vivid set of characters and sent them forth on an enthralling group of adventures. In Part Three,The Return of the King, Tolkien brings this transcendent work of fantasy literature to a truly epic conclusion.LikeThe Fellowship of the RingandThe Two Towers,The Return of the Kingis divided into two Books. Book V chronicles how the riders of the horse-kingdom of Rohan go to the rescue of the besieged realm of Gondor – a campaign that culminates in the epic Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Book VI tells the story of how Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who carries the One Ring of Power, journeys with his friend Samwise Gamgee into the heart of the evil land of Mordor, so that the ring may be destroyed by being cast into the fires of Mount Doom.As Part V begins, three members of the Fellowship – the man Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor; the elf prince Legolas; and the dwarf warrior Gimli – ride with the warrior horsemen of Rohan to the relief of Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, besieged as it is by Sauron's orc forces. Two other members of the Fellowship – the wizard Gandalf and the hobbit Peregrin (\"Pippin\") Took – join with the outnumbered Gondorian forces defending the city from within. The hobbit Meriadoc (\"Merry\") Brandybuck, another member of the Fellowship, has been told that he is too small to go to war; but he is taken there nonetheless by \"A young man…less in height and girth than most\" (p. 91). This \"young man\" is actually a young woman – the courageous shield-maiden Éowyn, who will play a decisive role in the coming battle.Tolkien, a devout Catholic, wroteThe Lord of the Ringsas a moral drama of the eternal conflict between good and evil; and one of the abiding themes ofThe Return of the Kingis that of people learning to follow what is good and avoid what is evil. This idea applies strongly, in this volume ofLOTR, to Rohan's king Théoden. In an earlier time, Théoden had been prey to the malign influence of his wicked counselor Grima Wormtongue, a spy for the renegade wizard Saruman. Now, however, Théoden has shaken off that evil influence; and as he leads his Rohirrim warriors to battle the orcs of Sauron before the walls of Minas Tirith, his restored power is described in language that combines Biblical cadences with images from theEddasof Norse mythology:Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them.(p. 138)Théoden's boldness and resolution contrast with the inactivity and despair of Denethor, Gondor's steward or caretaker of the throne. Confronted with this existential threat to the people of the kingdom he holds in trust, Denethor takes no action and offers no hope: \"Why do the fools fly?...Better to burn sooner than late, for burn we must\" (p. 120).The reason for Denethor's twisted state of mind is made clear when, in a tense conversation with Gandalf, the Gondorian steward \"drew aside [a] covering, and lo! he had between his hands apalantír\" (p. 157) – one of the lost Seeing Stones with which one can seek out hidden knowledge. One of the appendices toThe Return of the Kingexplains further the significance of this choice that Denethor made, and of its fateful consequences:[N]eeding knowledge, but being proud, and trusting in his own strength of will, [Denethor] dared to look in thepalantírof the White Tower. None of the Stewards had dared to do this….In this way Denethor gained his great knowledge of things that passed in his realm, and far beyond his borders, at which men marvelled; but he bought the knowledge dearly, being aged before his time by his contest with the will of Sauron. Thus pride increased in Denethor together with despair.(pp. 418-19)Thepalantíror Seeing Stones (some of which are in the hands of Sauron) embody the idea of forbidden knowledge – an important consideration for Tolkien, who believed that pride was the greatest of sins, the sin of Lucifer. Like Saruman, who studied demonology so assiduously that he eventually became demonic himself, Denethor has been corrupted by pridefully seeking power he was not meant to have.After the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the allied Gondorian and Rohirrim forces, albeit once again outnumbered, eventually gather for a second great battle, at the very gates of Mordor; and at a high point of conflict in that battle – \"The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!\" (p. 208) – the reader is suddenly plunged back into Frodo and Sam's lonely quest into the heart of Mordor.Tolkien's talent for descriptive language comes forth in passages like this one, in which Sam gets his first look at Mount Doom:Hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met [Sam's] gaze. Before his feet the highest ridge of the Ephel Dúath fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another ridge, much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner ring of the fences of the land. Far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great burning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusky red at the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed land. Sam was looking at Orodruin, the Mountain of Fire.(p. 214)The passages emphasizing Frodo's suffering as he carries the ever-heavier Ring toward Mount Doom make for difficult reading; I recall reading these passages ofThe Lord of the Ringsas a college freshman in Tidewater Virginia and thinking, \"This is definitely notThe Hobbit.\" And in a chapter titled simply \"Mount Doom,\" Frodo and Sam's portion of the quest finally reaches a dramatic resolution – one in which Gollum, the creature corrupted by the Ring and consumed by his need to get it back, plays a critical role, as Gandalf had foreseen inThe Fellowship of the Ring.As this book is titledThe Return of the King, it should be no surprise that an important part of the book centers around the renewal of Gondor under Aragorn, the country's rightful king:In his time the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in the days of its first glory; and it was filled with trees and with fountains, and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel, and its streets were paved with white marble; and the Folk of the Mountain laboured in it, and the Folk of the Wood rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made good, and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of children, and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty; and after the ending of the Third Age of the world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that were gone.(p. 304)And the members of the Fellowship must eventually part, in scenes that are often quite moving – as when one character, grievously wounded by the hardships of the quest, announces to a friend that he must leave Middle-Earth:\"I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so…when things are in danger: someone has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them….[Y]ou will read things out of the Red Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone, so that people will remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the more.\"(p. 382)Even though Tolkien made a point of denying that the work was meant to have any World War II parallels, no doubt quite a few 1950's readers ofThe Lord of the Rings, in countries like Great Britain and France and the United States of America, read passages like this one with a mental look back to the Second World War – and, perhaps, with a physical look across the room, to many a vacant chair in many a household around the world.And thusThe Lord of the Ringsends – a long and magnificent journey. So, then: now that you've readThe Lord of the Rings– all 1,359 pages of it – are you getting that feeling of letdown that sometimes accompanies finishing a long book that is also a great book? Well, do not despair – for there are 133 pages of appendices to take you even further into the world of Middle-Earth.The appendices include \"Annals of the Kings and Rulers,\" \"The Tale of Years\" (a chronology of the Westlands), \"Family Trees,\" a \"Shire Calendar,\" information on \"Writing and Spelling\" in the various Middle-Earth languages, and an appendix on \"The Languages and Peoples of the Third Age.\" One learns more about the love between Aragorn and the Elven princess Arwen – an area of greater emphasis in the Peter Jackson films than in the original books. There are even indexes to the poems and songs that form such a vital part of this fictive world; to various \"Persons, Beasts, and Monsters\" that play varying roles in the trilogy; and to places that are described or mentioned in the course of the narrative.All of this detail givesThe Lord of the Ringsthe feeling of being its own place, with its own reality – a placelivedrather than imagined. It is for this reason, no doubt, that if you attend an event like the annual Comic-Con in San Diego, you may well meetLOTRfans who not only are dressed like elves but also speak the Elven language perfectly – the same way you may meetStar Trekfans who dress in Klingon garb and speak fluent Klingon. While learning an imaginary language, in the spirit of fandom, is not my path – I'll stick with my studies of German and Hungarian, thank you – I respect the dedication of those who do follow that path, as I respect the sheer imaginative power of authors who can create a world so complete that readers or viewers of their works want so strongly to become a part of that world.And one part of Appendix F, \"On Translation,\" spoke to me with particular strength about some of the things that may have been on Tolkien's mind as he wroteThe Lord of the Rings. After discussing at some length the beautiful and flowing languages of the Elves, Tolkien speaks of the \"degraded and filthy\" language of the Orcs and Trolls, and then adds that \"Much the same sort of talk can still be heard among the orc-minded; dreary and repetitive with hatred and contempt, too long removed from good to retain even verbal vigour, save in the ears of those to whom only the squalid sounds strong\" (p. 514).Tolkien is right. Heaven knows that there are plenty of the orc-minded amongst us today.Reading this particular passage, I felt very strongly that John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was speaking from his own experience. I thought about his time as a second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers during the First World War. What was it like for a contemplative, bookish individual like Tolkien to be placed amidst the aggressive, action-oriented world of soldiering? Did he hear things like, \"Oi, what's the bloody Professor going to do – hit Jerry with one of his books?\" It would not surprise me.And these reflections make me think of theLord of the Ringscharacter that most reminds me of Tolkien himself – Faramir of Gondor. Younger son of the Steward Denethor, and younger brother to Boromir who was a member of the original Fellowship of the Ring, Faramir, with his gentle and kind disposition, is often overlooked by Gondorians who are drawn to the charisma of his combative older brother; he is perpetually out of favour with his father, until it is almost too late. But Faramir (unlike his brother Boromir) never loses his moral compass; he fights with quiet courage – as Tolkien himself is known to have done – and he meets and marries the love of his life, as Tolkien did.Faramir's kind of heroism – like the heroism of Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Arwen, Théoden, Éowyn, and all those who fought, in the War of the Ring, for the preservation of the freedom of the West – is something that we can all celebrate, and can try to emulate in our own lives, as we face the problems of the present day. And it is a kind of heroism that we can all return to, each time we turn that first page and start re-readingThe Lord of the Rings. And that, as Gandalf says, is an encouraging thought."

        "user_review": "\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\"You know the drill - Sam and Frodo are on their way to Mordor to try and destroy the ring, but not without a companion lurking in the shadows... The armies of the Dark Lord are massing in an epic battle for Middle Earth... it's all come down to this!And so my journey through Middle Earth has ended *cue hysterical crying*. Revisiting both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings this year was a great decision - I'll be revisiting Hogwarts in a similar way in 2018. There is always time to reread your favourite books because you will honestly pick up or learn something different each time. This time around my overriding experience has just been an appreciation of the friendship found within these pages. It has also solidified Samwise Gamgee's position as one of my fave characters of all time. Aragorn may get all the heart eyes, but Samwise is truly special.I thought at the end of my reread I would have a definitive conclusion on which of the three parts is my favourite. And to be blunt, I don't! I love them all for different reasons. The Fellowship is exciting because it's the beginning of the journey, the fellowship are all together... The Two Towers has some awesome parts and huge battles.... and The Return of the King just pulls at my heartstrings and breaks my heart because it's all ending!!The Return of the King has some crucial scenes with regards to Frodo and Sam's friendship; in particular, the lengths Sam will go to in order to ensure Frodo achieves what he set out to do - to destroy the ring. Gollum's appearances and interactions with the two of them are on point, as well! I also just love the entire sequence of Aragorn becoming King *heart eyes* This book also has one of the most epic parts of the series...\"But no living man am I! You look upon a woman.\"YASSSS! This moment! During the book and when I rewatch the movies I always feel like I'm waiting for this moment. Some shade is thrown Tolkien's way for the lack of real female power in this story, but this scene SLAYS for me. There's much to learn within this story and a lot is still relevant today. The friendship that forms between elf and dwarf, regardless of prejudice. The hobbits who were at first deemed to be weak and useless, who then turn out to be some of the bravest characters in literature. The need to fight for the greater good, to combat the evil in the world - and to have a friend by your side as you do it. Because things aren't always easy, but if you have a good friend to support you, you can overcome anything.I do have a couple of issues with ROTK though - I just felt like the entire scouring of the Shire was completely unnecessary. It felt a bit tacked on at the end. As others have said before me, you do feel like Tolkien found it hard to say goodbye to this epic story he had written, and so you keep getting ending after ending after ending. On the same note though, I never want this story to end sooooo it doesn't entirely bother me!!!I am in awe of this world that Tolkien created - it truly is the benchmark by which all other fantasy is measured. These movies and the books are enshrouded in nostalgia for me and revisiting Middle Earth is always like coming home. As I was reading through the last 5 or so pages I could just feel tears running down my face! I don't think any other piece of literature has this effect on me every time I revisit. It's a journey I will take many times in my life and it holds a very special place in my bookish heart. I can't give it any less than 5 stars."

The end of a sweeping epic, one which held me firmly in its grasp as a child and still holds a place in my heart as an adult.Everything is in motion and actually coming to an end almost from the first page of this last book in the trilogy. Frodo is ever so close to completing his quest. Aragon, Gandalf and the others are nearly at the end of their rope. Indeed, the end is nigh!But this is not a quick finish. Tolkien dragged things out. There is a mini-battle after the great war has concluded. Many a loose end is tied up. The tearful goodbyes are interminable. I certainly didn't want it to end. I would've been happy if this series had continued on indefinitely. When I first read this as a young teen, I was a very slow reader. It took me nearly two years to finish and by then I was fully attached to these characters.That attachment began when I was about five years old, when I saw the Rankin Bass animated version of this book on TV. I cried like a baby when Frodo and Sam were trying to escape what appeared to be their inevitable death. I held on to that memory and supplemented it over the years with the other animated versions of Tolkien's Middle Earth series. So, by the time I got around to readingThe Lord of the Rings, I was as good as a card-carrying member of the fan club.Certainly this series isn't for everyone. I've heard many complain about it for various reasons: too many characters, an impenetrable backstory, etc. The recurring complaint that the books are too dense was something Tolkien was apparently aware of, because he included a very helpful appendix section at the back ofReturn...which answers some questions the reader may have as well as filling in more of the background details if you're confused or just interested in learning more."

The Return of the King follows Frodo and his companions as they go on separate journeys to fight the war, defeat the enemy and destroy the ring.It took me a while to get into this book, but once I did I was immersed in this fantastic and detailed world that the author created. I am blown away by how detailed this world is, the author created his own languages, a unique world and awesome people such as elves, orcs, wizards, dwarves, hobbits, and more. At times though I felt overwhelmed by the world. The characters are so awesome and complex. My favorite characters are Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn and Legolas. Honestly Sam is the best, he is brave, honest, loyal, kind, and helpful. Sam's character development was excellent, he really grew so much as a person and learned to be brave during difficult times. Gandalf is great, he is wise, helpful, loyal and powerful. Aragorn is charming, strong, resilient, kind and brave. I wish there was more focus on Aragorn and Legolas' character development and perspective. I wanted to learn more about them and read the events from their perspective. I was very happy with how the book ended, I'm glad that everything was resolved and ended on a happy note. I'm sad this series is over, but my experience while reading this book will stay with me for a long time.I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, excellent world building and awesome characters!"

        "user_review": "Warning: The dragons in this review are named Giant and Spoilers. I have tried to shield most of them from view, but don't get mad at me if one of them burns you. With this book, it was bound to happen.This one was a real mudfight. Between me, myself and I.Me didn't get beyond \"SQUEEE!\" for several hundred pages,Myself, while also trying to get over her grammatically awkward name, came up with the logical reasoning why this reaction was totally okay and based on something other than left over teenage hormones...and I glared at both of these two delusional fools and tried to figure out what was wrong with them.With these three in my head, along with GRRM's cast of thousands, it made for a very messy, crowded and contradictory reading experience. It didn't take me a week to finish this book because it was long. It took me a week to finish this book because the three people in my head needed to have it out after every chapter and big moment and would not shut up. Needless to say this is going to be a bit of a mixed review. So. Let's start with the good stuff and get everybody settled in, shall we?The Good: So, as usual, GRRM's world is three dimensional (or perhaps more, I might've lost track in one of the appendices), sprawling, dirty, pulsing and real. It's a banner of spices, wine, and gardens in full bloom unfurling. Opening these books is like walking into a forest and picking up a handful of dirt, letting it run through your fingers as you start on one of the hundred paths you know are waiting. After six years, it was a thrill to let it envelope me, and at least at first, I was totally fine just letting myself be guided unresisting through the scenery.I also think that this book has a lot of really good things to say about politics, law, war, and the realities of being a ruler or a subject. The first few chapters seemed like a treatise on how fragile the foundations of law are, and in particular international law of any kind. GRRM shows everyone still scrambling from the disasters of Storm of Swords, trying to find some way to survive, after all existing law and order has disappeared. The law is just another chimera is people resort to: using outdated or foreign or superseded laws as weapons, and applying them wildly out of context because that's the only way they can justify themselves.He's even better at talking about the wages of war and the realities of the aftermath. Aside from his squirm inducing descriptions of battle wounds, entrails hanging in bushes, and flies crawling out of eyeballs which, if nothing else, will not let anyone reading forget what war is, GRRM is excellent at showing how the cycle of conflict never, never, ever ends. We're five books and twenty years on from the rebellion that put the events of Game of Thrones in motion, and there are at least four wars going on and three generations fighting them. The kids die and these old men linger on and on, cherishing plots within plots in hopes of revenge for events that occurred thirty years before. And the thing is that they still matter, because they're still sitting there in their positions of power, long after the world is supposedly fighting about something else. They will rear their heads andstab theonly good manin a viper's nest because he is threatening them with peace in a way that they have not planned. Peace and war mean nothing next to utopia and imperfections- waiting for it all to turn out just the way they planned is their ultimate payoff for years of humiliations and insults. Old men with all their eggs in one basket ar terrifying. The last chapter of this book was, ultimately, one of the more satisfying (though not as much as it could have been, see below) things in the book-as Varys, poor, forgotten old still powerful, connected Varys who no one could ever entirely control comes out of nowhere. It's always the butler, you guys. But someone forgot to tell that to the Seven Kingdoms.It was also great that along with these never ending generational conflicts, there were plots within plots with little tunnels leading to other plots. Those in Plot A might be involved in/aware of B, but certainly don't know about C, though people in D are certainly aware of A but not B, etc, and are clearly going to have spectacular head-on collisions from flailing about in the dark, or thinking they understood the plan when they were very very wrong. I am a big fan of dropping Life Happens into carefully plotted stories. Just because. Because traffic jams on the interstate don't know that you have an hour to defuse the bomb, and the lady next door was in a bad mood yesterday. You can't just trust that you can go through the motions you have planned out and it will be okay- you have to work at each motion and there's someone to be paid off, distracted, appeased, or avoided at each step.I also liked that this book was an up close and personal look at all the stuff that King Robert was whining about in the first book- winning a kingdom is relatively easy compared to holding it. Winning is hammers and glory and a single purpose, holding is compromising and trudging your feet in the mud to get one inch of what you really want done. In a country where presidential campaigns get longer every year, and the news media prefers to analyze who 'won' and 'lost' at every political occasion ever, I feel like this is not an unimportant insight to bring up and explore. Of course they prefer to concentrate on the gladiatorial aspect- it is easy, clear, and not fraught with moral tangles that would be 'elitist' to try to discuss in a complex way on national television. Plus, ruling every day isboringand almost universally depressing. The wages of winning wars are getting what you wish for, over and over again, and finding out that what you wish for is just going to make someone else want to kill you as much as you wanted to kill the guy before. Martin is upfront about the terrible choices available to even a well meaning ruler (though from Stannis to Daenerys, the definition of 'well meaning' certainly varies), and the realization that you will never, ever make a choice that will not hurt someone.A lot of people think that this book could have been skipped over, but I don't think so. This is a necessary book in an epic that is really, in the end, thousands of pages about the nature of war and kings. Again, a lot of people don't like all the random peripheral characters introduced, and the consequent lessening of the amount of screen time that we spend with old favorites, but I actually liked it. Ongoing conflicts and uncertainty will continue to involve more and more people, forced to finally become involved, or become something they weren't before, and the game board will change day by day according to how desperate people get to live or how irresistible taking advantage of the chaos becomes. There are so many types of wounds, from so many different times and places, and Martin manages to show them all (everything from that excellent moment whereTyrion slaps Penny, which kind of broke my heart a little to the disturbing, hard to read Reek chapters. Do I think that his sprawling, ungainly cast of characters wereallnecessary? No. Do I think that we neededtwobooks like this? No. I also don't think he probably needed ten years and nearly two thousand pages to do this. In addition, I think that the map he's laid out for himself is going to cause him problems in the future. But for now, this is an extremely effective book about how surreal, insane and mindboggingly awful war is. That works for me.All right, now we come to the not-so-good to bad areas. Unfortunately, there were quite a few of these. First of all, while Martin's world is three dimensional and vivid, he forgot to make his characters that way in this book. This is an odd occurrence. One of his strong points is generally how character focused these books are. But the story's gotten away from Martin is my opinion. He's gotten to the point in his series where he needs to start marching people along to a particular place, and people are now becoming signposts, of a sort. I think so many of these characters have now been stuck along a sort of continuum from innocence to corruption, from power mad to submissive, that that's all that matters about them anymore. Either they are the extreme of innocence (Quentyn, Penny) or they are incredibly worldly wise, and there's very little room for grey in the middle. Martin's characterizations are not about people who sing, or a guy who moves his head in a weird way, or a man who must have three eggs every morning, the way you would usually do a character study, but simply what incarnation of power they are. And then he took an overly long time to tell me about their classification. Tyrion is perhaps the exception, and there are several moments that defied this, such as thekilling of Janos Slynt, the chapter where the Dorne kid gets burned up, a moment where Barristan Selmy wrestles with his service of Robert, these felt real. Because they were sudden, made sense with characterization, had complex history and motivations behind them, and told me all I needed to know. But with the exception of theSlynt part, he took ten unnecessary chapters to lead up to one good moment. Aside a few moments and Tyrion, Martin tears down any other motivation someone might have for something. There's no room for a combined grey area of delusion, belief, family, the desire to be good, desire to improve, to make a name, the motivations of guilt and/or grief. It's always, always, always about power. I don't think that this is a realistic way of depicting why people act the way they do. Did hemaybe take this back with the last chapter? With Varys and his long cherished belief in the prince? I don't know. Somehow I don't think so. We'll have to see in another five years.Also, although I thought that Martin did make a number of good points (as detailed above), he also spent a thousand pages belaboring four points into the ground, and telling me rather than showing me, most of the time. Or showing me and then telling me later, which was almost worse. One: Everything is ugly/anything that is pretty is evil or doomed (um, the entire book), Two: love is always something else in reality (Tyrion, Quentyn, Daenerys, etc), Three: \"words are wind\" (EVER AGAIN, TOO SOON), Four: Clothes make the man (Cersei, Tyrion, Arya, Quentyn, Daenerys, the \"mummers\"). He hit me in the face with these points so many times, it went from being interesting and/or vivid to me wondering what sort of complexes he was working out on the page or asking mself he was just lazy or tired enough by the end of the book to just not care very much, and so repeating himself from earlier. I mean, I have so many questions. For example, why is it that everyone who is beautiful must be punished? I understand the skin deep thing and beauty is definitely a tool in the power game that can be taken away from someone, but why is it that it always, always must be wrong? You're all about realism- it felt like a point, not like the random lottery it should be of beautiful people who are nice and those who are jerks, those who are innocent and those who are manipulative. Did we really need Arya's entire storyline and most of Cersei's to tell us that people see what you look like? That social rank is all trappings? I don't think so. And yet, there seemed to be little point other than that.Also, the bigger issue for me was that, I don't know how to say this, but I think that Martin has forgotten why we all liked him in the first place. Or at least why I do, in large part. Because of his insistence on breaking down delusions and tales and attempting to retell legends with a dose of messy reality. The biggest symbol of this seemed to be his ability to deal with the most difficult reality of all: death. Fantasy and sci-fi genres have a lot of tools at their disposal to ensure that main characters never need to face this permanently. He chose to insist on it, quite effectively, starting right away in GoT. And now, five books laterit seems like he's decided to backpedal on the one thing that made him famous,like he can't live up to the way he helped transform the genre (or part of it) and the others who have followed in the kind of 'movement' he began. Guys like Joe Abercrombie and Scott Lynch and all the rest. The genre's moved on from where it was when he first killed Eddard Stark,and it seems like he's moved backwards and he regrets his decision that war and violence have permanent consequences and people who are important and likeable can die. Jon gets stabbed at the end of the book, but after all the false cliffhangers and people returned from the dead, who reading this ACTUALLY believes he is dead? I haven't the slightest faith that he is. Nor that Daenerys is in any danger. Nor that Ned or Rhaegar are dead, either. Okay, Ned probably is, but at this point, why not? Why would you go back on the thing you're most known for? I don't get his thinking. Just getting too attached to characters and exercising his powers as God to bring back anyone he regrets killing now?Maybe this would have been fine if all these books had come out one after the other in the late 1990s, but his audience (including me) has grown up now. I was in my early teen years when I started these books. They shaped my idea of what awesome fantasy was in a lot of ways since they got me so young and impressionable. But even I'm impatient with him now. The trappings aren't enough to convince me he's Important in some way. He's still writing the same book he did in 1996, and not writing it as well.I mean, I did try to put myself in his shoes. He's probably been surrounded at conventions by fanboys and girls for ten years now, and in addition, my understanding is that he has been very lightly edited by his publishing house for at least the last two volumes because they just want to get the things out on the market and make some money. I can't conceive that he gets challenged a great deal about whatever he writes, so he has little motivation to think that he's doing anything less than perfect. I mean, I don't know, it's just a conjecture. At the opposite end of the spectrum, he's held onto this book for so long and the hype has become so breathless that he must've felt the overwhelming need for some good old fashioned shock and awe. Hencethose silly cliffhangers at the end of each chapter, and the amount of people getting brought back from the dead. I can see someone getting to that point after wracking their brain for six years to come up with something so startling we'd wait another half decade for the next one.I can only imagine the pressure. He wrote on his blog constantly about untangling the Meereenese knot. And the thing is.. after six years I don't think he did. I think he wrote about the knot itself. Is that what I just paid for? 1000 pages of you telling me why you couldn't move the plot forward? After 900 pages of doing that in the last book? I have a lot of patience for big books, and as I stated I don't in principle mind peripheral characters, but I think we have to admit that he's making his task in moving forward all the harder by introducing all these new threads and names, when he doesn't even know what to do with the main storyline. Oh, maybe that's why he did it. Just to stall. I don't know.In the end, my reaction to this book was, \"Oh. So GRRM is just a normal fantasy writer now. Okay.\" That's pretty much the point. His methods and plotting is no longer vanguard, different, or really, much above average for the genre. I mean, that isn't a horrible put down. Says a lot about the quality of at least the first three books, or at least my experience of them. It's just run of the mill fantasy, from a plot perspective, with some writing skill and ideas that rise above, at times.Just not enough times. Not nearly enough times.I mean, don't get me wrong. I'll be in line with all of you forWinds of Winterwhen it comes out sometime in my old age. He's earned that much, and at this point, his books have been big milestones of my adult reading life. I just expect that I will be reading it with more realistic expectations, rather than with the wide eyed breathless staying-up-all-night attitude that I dove into this one with.Sorry, y'all. I won this particular mudfight. And I didn't even really want to. Damnit.* * *UPDATE: Where all my nerds be at? BECAUSE THIS JUST GOT REAL:http://georgerrmartin.com/if-update.html* * *ORIGINAL: Amazon NOW claims that this book is coming out next fall. I'll believe it when I see it in my hands, George. Until then, I will assume this is another in your WEB OF LIES."

Prepare todieroll in dough as we continue buying your brick-sized creations.(The above is what you'd expect from a book titled \"A Dance with Dragons.\"Disclaimer:For the vast majority of this book's pages, none of it happens.)Yes, I have a few problems with this latest installment in GRRM's neverending magnum opus. I have high standards for GRRM after ASOIAF 1-3. Hey, I read GRRM before I ever read Tolkien.He showed me that it was okay to hold fantasy to high standards, for crying out loud!And now I am disappointed. *sadface* So allow me to use this review space for the gripe-fest.A thousand-plus pages doorstopper (this book can easily serve as a self-defense weapon in a dark alley) - and yetthe story advances by a few millimeters at best.Nothing gets resolved. The characters spend pages and pages going about mundane tasks, participating in endless drawn-out conversations, pissing, eating, drinking, pissing, whoring, eating some more, pissing again. Is it supposed to make the story GRRM's trademark \"gritty and realistic\"?Seriously, I have not encountered this much information about bodily functions and food outside of nephrology textbooks and Food Network.This overload of description of landscapes, clothing, banquets, people, and food makes me snooze. FILLER!And it makes me wonder whether any editors AT ALL were involved in the creative process.-------------------------------------------------------------------------GRRM's trademark move is ending everything with an\"OMG CLIFFHANGER!!!!!\". Maybe it stems from his TV-writing days: the notion that the readers will tune back in, despite nothing really happening in the entire episode, only if the hero is left hanging off the cliff at the end?That's what this book felt like to me: pages and pages of very little happening, of a narrative stagnation, of endless repetitive conversations.And then, with a few chapters left to go -BAM! POW! BOOM!(Dragons are released! Jon (maybe) dies! Dany flies Drogon and meets Dothraki! Aegon invades! Jaime trades one cliffhanger for another!Which guarantees that we will read the next book. Cheap and lazy trick, Mr. Martin.In the meantime, I see another Tyrion or Dany or Quentyn or Davos chapter and get a nagging feeling - wait, haven't I read this already?-------------------------------------------------------------------------WORDS ARE WIND- GRRM seems to hammer this message in on what feels like every other page. Yet if this book is any indication, given the lack of overall storyline development,HE HAS PASSED MORE THAN ENOUGH OF IT.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Neverending repetition in this book is grating.Just to name a few:\"Words are wind\", \"leal\", \"neeps\", \"where do whores go?\", \"kissed by fire\", \"Reek rhymes with...\", \"jape\", \"nipples on a breastplate\", \"kill the boy\", \"it is known\", \"must needs\"... Enough already! I miss the times when I was just eyerolling at\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\". Which makes its appearance here as well, by the way.-------------------------------------------------------------------------My problem with this book is thatI expected astory. You know, where things are happening and storylines advance. VERY LITTLE OF THAT HAPPENS. Very few of the storylines led anywhere. Those that advanced somewhat were Jon's, Dany's, and Bran's (and the first two should have been trimmed a bit), and Theon/Reek's story was fascinating in its horror (RamsaySnowBolton joins the list of most hated characters EVER).And yet we are still barely a step away from the events that transpired back inStorm of Swords.And as for other storylines... Tyrion gives us a travelogue, and nothing that we could not have covered in a single chapter. Arya is doing pretty much the same stuff as before. Jaime's chapter traded one cliffhanger for another, and frankly, just like Cersei's chapters, was not necessary. Davos's and Quentyn's arcs could have been summed up with a sentence each in somebody else's POV. The ironborn, Dorne, Barristan - why were they needed in this book, again?A pictographic summary of ADWD.------------------------------------------------------------------------Which leads me neatly to what I think is the root of all evil. GRRM's trademark move number two is supposed to be killing off characters. I call BS on that. Yes, he killed a few protagonists.BUT IN THEIR STEAD HE UNFAILINGLY SPROUTS WHAT FEELS LIKE DOZENS MORE.It seems that everyone and their grandmother is getting a POV chapter these days, which bogs down the story quite a bit.I really only care about the characters that we met in the first couple of books. I do understand the need to occasionally give us a perspective through a fresh set of eyes. That's cool. But here is a problem:(a) Do I really need an insight into the head ofEVERYONE?Leave me with some mystery, please.(b) Too many cooks spoil the soup. I lose track of the overall story which comes to a standstill dealing with its ever-expanding cast.(c) The entire story arc of Quentyn Martell. Why? The details of his voyage were unnecessary to the story. His ultimate act was interesting, yes - so why not dedicate just ONE chapter to himturning into a crisp?The story by now seems to have sprawled too wide and out of Mr. Martin's control.How can he satisfactorily wrap up this monster of a story with only two more planned volumes unless he pulls a Steven King inThe Standand suddenly kills off most of his POV characters? Which raises a question - why the need to introduce them in the first place?-------------------------------------------------------------------------Martin is still a better writer than many out there - despite the gripe-fest above.But this was a mostly unsatisfying read which could have benefited from some serious editing and trimming of the verbal diarrhea.I will still read the next installment (when it's out, in a decade or so) - mainly because I need some resolution to this story despite its declining quality. I hope the next book will resemble the first three volumes.3 stars."

        "user_review": "\"Words are wind,\" says George R. R. Martin (GRRM) no less than 13 times in the latest installment of hisA Song of Ice and Fireseries. In this incrediblywindytome there was very little advancement of the overall story and no resolution to any of the myriad plot threads. Instead, most of the book followed characters travelling, yet in its 1,000+ pages onlyonereaches his destination while the rest arestill travelling.Words are wind, and GRRM is a windbag. His predilection for overwriting is ridiculous; an editor wasdesperatelyneeded andsorelymissed. Had this book been properly edited, we might have been saved 129 appearances of GRRM's new favorite words: leal, niello, neeps, nightsoil, serjeant, jape, and nuncle. Or spared 151 repetitions of annoying phrases like:Where do whores go?You know nothing, Jon Snow.words are windit is knownmuch and morelittle and lessmust needsa man growna woman grown and flowerednipples on a breastplateReek, rhymes with...(he/she/name) was not wrongGRRM likes to flood the reader with lists. Lists of dishes served at every meal, the exact order people entered and left rooms, a list of over 40 heraldic shields thatused to hangin the Shieldhall of Castle Black:Hundreds of knights meant hundreds of shields. Hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, bulls, trees and flowers, harps, spears, crabs and krakens, red lions and golden lions and chequy lions, owls, lambs, maids and mermen, stallions, stars, buckets and buckles, flayed men and hanged men and burning men, axes, longswords, turtles, unicorns, bears, quills, spiders and snakes and scorpions, and a hundred other heraldic charges had adorned the Shieldhall walls, blazoned in more colors than any rainbow ever dreamed of.I do not like lists, GRRM. I would not like them here or there. I would not like them anywhere. I do not like lists. I do not like them, GRRM.GRRM has become so well-known for killing off characters that he made a joke of it when heintroduced a brand new POV character in the prologue, spent 33 pages (on my ereader) developing the character, then killed him off at the end of the prologue.All of which was entirely pointless to the story.GRRM ruined two of my favorite characters. Tyrion has become a whiny obsessive with daddy issues. Danaerys went from a strong-willed, self-righteous, slaughtering conqueror to a helpless, love-torn, indecisive, ineffectual character from a Jane Austen novel. GRRM cannot seem to write a strong female character unless she's a warrior (Brienne, Ygritte, Arya). He's disturbingly focused on tits and cunny (his word).Robert Jordan'sCrossroads of Twilighthas often been called \"Characters Show Up\", which would be an equally appropriate title for GRRM'sA Dance with Dragons. I couldn't put it down,notbecause it was great, but becauseI couldn't wait to be done with it and move on to a better book. It's sad that's the best thing I can say about it."

        "user_review": "Tyrion Lannister's horse was rubbing him raw as they rode onward, the branches of the trees above them swaying in a branch-like way. Ravens flew about among them, and clouds of dust hovered like halos around the hooves of their steeds.Wiping sweat from his brow, Tyrion spoke to yet another minor character you've never seen before. \"I hear that the Morvin and the Shornpel clans have sided with Darvus Farier from the great city of Bee Eff Eee, and are pushing forward late king Baratheon's bastard's scullery maid's uncle's melanoma as the true heir to the throne.\"The minor character chortled as he spooned up some of the newt egg soup. It had been spiced with cloves and the lightest touch of pepper, and leaves of cilantro floated like corpses upon its surface. Eating a side of braised elk spleen and a hunk of bread with a cheese sauce, the minor character said, \"If so, even more of the action is likely to shift away from the viewpoint characters, and THEN we'll see whether any of the characters from the first volume even make it to the final book,A Trample of Turtles.\"\"But,\" Tyrion pondered aloud, eating inch-long prawns from a trencher filled with a hot butter sauce, \"If the Starks send nine hundred of their men from the outer borders of ThatoneplaceImentionedOnce, and they move down toward the Lannister forces on Dragon's Fjord before the Lannister forces can unite with the Great Army of the Unwashed Men, perhaps they can defeat the bunjillion soldiers in the south now being ushered in the general direction of King's Landing by that one other guy. I can't remember his name. You know, the one?\"The minor character shrugged, tearing a piece from his bread bowl and dipping it into a small puddle of balsamic vinegar. \"You forget about the people beyond the wall, and the dragons in the east, and Bobbert, King Robert's mechanic. He now claims to have been conceived with the king's own cum, and thus has a claim to the throne.\"Tyrion scratched his chin. \"That does throw a new light on how convoluted things are becoming.\"They continued riding, their horses traveling gradually. More branches passed overhead. It felt as if the traveling had gone on indefinitely, and the audience was more than capable of empathizing. Tyrion munched on fresh radishes and drank a bold red wine from a skin hanging from his belt. The wine was rich, with plum flavorings and an oaky aftertaste.\"But,\" said Tyrion, suggesting another possible set of things that could happen. He made reference to an event that happened nine-hundred pages ago, but remembered it wrong, then postulated what the possible outcome could be. They rode onward. Minor Character munched on some pine nuts.SUDDENLY, SOMETHING EPIC WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!Chapter 2Eudaknow An Eudongivafuck, minor noble from Shelbyville, rubbed his temple, filled with anxiety at being introduced as a new viewpoint character 9,600 pages into the series. How would he live up to the amazing characters who had come before him and died so tragically? Perhaps because he had a valid claim to the throne, Having been the barista in King Robert's favorite coffeehouse. Yeah, that was the ticket. Riding his steed/ship across the desert/glenn/ocean/alley, he traveled gradually, wondering when he would arrive. Discussing with the others upon the ship, he theorized about possible outcomes of the conflicts in Westeros, all the while eating a succulent pomegranate, red juices running down his chin like he'd just been chewing on afterbirth.SUDDENLY, SOMETHING AMAZING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!Chapter 3The titties tittied, jiggling with much breastful bosomliness. The oiled girls with Brazilian waxes down below wrestled and licked each other's areolas, but it was only to help you become immersed in a realistic depiction of the ancient world. As the breasts bosomed with titful abandon, Tyrion ate shark flank. It had been buttered, cooked for twenty minutes at 345 degrees, then drizzled with a lemon sauce and allowed to cool for five minutes. The flavor was only mildly fishy, and Tyrion burped, taking another drink of the white zinfandel before digging into the raspberry crepes with a chocolate fondu. \"But still, Measter, you must understand the possibilities of that event rely on Stannis placing all of his trust in the moody lords of the upper northwest. They are known for being fickle and not holding to their oaths, and Stannis is more likely to try and seize the Port of Skulls. Will the king's ninth bastard even survive that battle? If so, at what cost to Stannis? Plus, what happens if the Lannisters and the Starks team up, and get Batman to join them, and Stannis can only get Iron Man? What then?\"Measter laughed at the dwarf. \"That may be, dwarf. You might be short and a dwarf, but you have a mind as sharp as a blade. But you are very tiny, in case that had escaped anyone's notice. Even so, if Stannis enlists Dumbledore, Gandalf and Belgarion, he will be more than a match for the team-up of Lannister, Batman and Stark. Even if they get Rocky Balboa and Wesley Willis on their side.\"Tyrion watched the boobs. \"But what about Joshua Lyman? Because he could totally take Dumbledore, and maybe Iron Man.\"Tyrion ate a lamb gyro, thinking back to the exciting thing that happened after the last chapter ended, thinking of it in an ambiguous and incomplete way. Since it had been 100 pages since his last chapter, you had entirely forgotten what the exciting thing at the end of the chapter was anyway, so it was not much of a loss. \"Well,\" he said, \"Now that all of the titties have jiggled sufficiently, we must needs be back on the road.\"They rode their steeds along a road, hooves raising up halos of dust, the ravens flittering about in the branches and saying what words they had picked up from the conversation.\"Death!\"\"Dumbledore!\"\"Titties!\"The half-man, who was short and a dwarf, wiped the sweat from his brow.SUDDENLY. . ."

        "user_review": "Released eleven years ago today!This is the review I did for the Sunday Express. It only appeared in hardcopy so I can't link it.Since it's a national newspaper and many of the readers may never have read a fantasy book, let alone the first four in the ASOIAF series, the review is less about this book and more about the series and the author. I hope to make them the gift of a great reading experience.My rating for the book is set in the context of the alternative works of fantasy on the shelves rather than in an attempt to rank this volume amongst its predecessors (I would say signficantly better than A Feast For Crows - less good than the first three, still excellent)[Sunday Express review]By the time you reach the end of George Martin's A Dance with Dragons you will be nearly two million words into A Song of Ice and Fire, a sprawling epic fantasy series that is for many readers the single most defining work in the genre for a generation. A Dance with Dragons is itself over four hundred thousand words (one thousand printed pages), not that far shy of the whole of The Lord of the Rings or War and Peace - not that literary worth is measured on weighing scales.Martin's series, starting with A Game of Thrones, has been a slow-burning phenomenon, dwarfed only by the colossus that is Harry Potter. Right now all the volumes are on the Amazon top twenty list. When A Dance With Dragons was released in hardback last month it immediately became the fastest-selling fiction hardback this year in the UK.It has probably been the most anticipated (adult) fantasy novel ever published, helped of course by the recent excellent serialisation of the first book by HBO. A significant contribution to the anticipation has been the six-year wait since the last book, a source of controversy and teeth grinding amongst the readership. Internet grumbling about the delay reached such a pitch it prompted Neil Gaiman to blog to fans: 'George Martin is not your bitch'. Whilst the books may roll out of the printing house on a conveyor belt, the words themselves cannot simply be squeezed out of the author by mounting pressure!So, has it been worth the six year wait? There was a five-year wait for book four, A Feast for Crows, and many fans felt the novel didn't fulfill the promise of the first three, making the critical success of book five the focus of still more intense speculation.Martin's success stands on the simple fact that he has brought to the fantasy genre the mature skills of realism, characterisation, and observation more commonly associated with literary fiction, and married them to a vivid and endless imagination. His commercial success derives from the fact that the books are addictively enjoyable.You don't need to be a reader of fantasy to enjoy Martin's work. Martin writes primarily about people. You will have fallen in love with, or at least be fascinated by, his characters long before you see your first dragon. By that point you'll believe in the dragon because you believe in the people through whose eyes you see it.A Dance with Dragons advances the story with more purpose and scope than its predecessor, reacquainting us with favourite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Dany, and Bran) we've not seen since A Storm of Swords (2000). The story ranges across thousands of miles from icy wastes to dusty desert, expanding the incredible diversity of Martin's world, showing stories on the small scale (Arya's training) and the grand (Daenerys' realpolitik). And although the 1000 pages meander through many lives and situations, there are hints at the ultimate convergence and conflict of disparate story threads, a slow building sense of momentum, and finally a rising tension and pace that drives us breathless to the edge of several cliffs.One quote that stuck with me is \"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.\" And George Martin offers you a fair portion of those thousand right here.Turning the final page you can only be disappointed . . . to find it is the last, and you'll immediately want to reach for the next volume. And there maybe lies the rub.Edit - and 10 years later it's really starting to rub! Here are the books I've published in between book 5 & 6 of this seriesThough to be fair, GRRM's books are MUCH longer than mine and sell a lot better too!Join my PatreonJoin my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.."

        "user_review": "A Dance with Disappointments.I really thoughtA Feast for Crowswould've been the lowest point of the main series. I was wrong because this book didn't show any sign of improvement. In fact, I thought this was even worse due to the boring setting and unnecessary length of this tome. If it weren't obvious before, this book displayed Martin's struggle with writing his main series even more. Realistically speaking, due to the direction of the story in this book, I'm quite confident thatA Song of Ice and Firemost likely will never be completed.\"Winter is coming, Jon reflected. And soon, too soon. He wondered if they would ever see a spring.\"Me too, Jon Snow. Me too. I do believe that we'll getThe Winds of Wintereventually, but the planned final book of the series,A Dream of Spring, is indeed a dream.Picture:A Dance with Dragonsby Marc SimonettiFocusing on a different set of characters geographically, the story inA Dance with Dragonsstarts simultaneously withA Feast for Crows. It eventually went further beyond the one in the previous installment. How further though? Not by much; definitely doesn't require a book this massive (400k words) to achieve. The last 15% was great. Yes, once again it ended in a massive cliffhanger—with no sequel in sight—but man the last 150ish (out of 1,100) pages of this book were awesome. The first 85%, however, is a different story.I honestly don't have too many things to say other than the parts that didn't work for me here. The parts that worked for me were so small on the larger scale of things so I'll start with saying that Jon Snow's POV was great, I was never bored with his storyline. I consider Bran's and Reek's POV a pleasant surprise because I certainly didn't expect to enjoy their POV that much. Seeing Reek suffered repeatedly gave me immense satisfaction. Cersei's walk of shame was also incredibly well-written and I felt like Martin was back at his best in this scene. Just likeA Feast for Crows, almost all the final chapters of each character were superb. However, to reach them I practically had to REALLY force myself in order to finish this book.\"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, said Jojen. The man who never reads lives only one.\"The main reason why I'm disappointed with this one is very simple to talk about: there were too many unnecessary contents.A Feast for CrowsandA Dance with Dragonscould've been easily compressed into one book. The cumulative word count of these two books reached 700k words and yet the actual storyline progressed the least; the content inA Clash of Kings(318k words) alone have so much more significant plot progression compared to these two. There were also too many repetitive phrases. How many times do I have to read the phrases \"words are wind,\"? I guess Martin was emphasizing how the hundreds of thousands of words in his two books were unnecessary, but still. It was highly infuriating reading Daenerys's indecisive libido spiraling out of control for hundreds of pages. \"I want to fuck him hard,\" and \"oh no, but I must not show my horniness,\" line of thoughts regarding Daario being repeated so many times pissed me off so hard; it felt like I was reading a teenage (technically, she is a teenager I know) angst story that's usually found in YA books. Plus, I can't believe I'm saying this, but Tyrion's POV ended up being one of the most boring POV to read in this book. Not THE most, we have Victarion Greyjoy and the Martell to thank for that, but Tyrion spent almost the entirety of the book getting wasted and asking \"where do the whore go?\", to every person he met. C'mon… enough already. Go to a brothel.No matter how you look at it, proceeding an installment geographically is not a good choice in an epic fantasy. It was very obvious fromA Feast for Crowsand this book that Martin was stuck in his writing that he had to divide his books this way. Doing this kind of storytelling makesThe Winds of Winterextremely hard to write. The characters cast have grown so large—18 POV in this book—pointlessly and now Martin has to make sure that the huge number of POV's he separated in book 4 and 5 both converged and proceed together in the sixth book. There's no way he can afford another repetition of the divisive storytelling method, especially when the fans have been waiting for eight years for the next book to come out. Book purists have complained a lot about Dorne's storyline being cut off the TV shows; I disagree with this. What made this book worse for me was how uninteresting all the story beyond Westeros were. I loved the characters and setting of Westeros; I want to read more about them. I don't want to read this Meeren, Volantis, Pentos, or Dorne. There's a good reason why season 5 of the TV show is filled with the content of book 4 and book 5.A Storm of Swordshad to be divided into two seasons because there's so much amazing content in them. Book 4 and 5 is the other way around. When you take away all the repetitive and the boring content, the plot progression of these two books was utterly small and I think the TV adaptation up to season 6 did a better job in making sure the story remains engaging to the viewers.I may be the odd one here, but I honestly thinkA Dance with Dragonswas even weaker thanA Feast for Crows; the pacing of these two books was simply abysmal. I still loveA Song of Ice and Fireand Martin's writing; the first three books in this series were absolutely amazing. I stand by my words that Martin is an extremely important figure in modern fantasy, but this and the previous book were a huge disappointment.I've heard from many readers of the same opinion as I did towardsA Feast for CrowsandA Dance with Dragonsthat on reread, their reading experience of these two books improved significantly. I'm looking forward to the day when I reread this series, and hopefully, I sincerely hope I will end up agreeing with them. If I do, I'll rewrite my review forA Feast for CrowsandA Dance with Dragons. I don't know how Martin will be able to get his series back on track and I sincerely hope he will be able to. For now, let's just say that I'm glad I've read this book because now I can wait forThe Winds of Winterwithout getting my hopes up.You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel Notions"

        "user_review": "PROLOGUEHe awoke to the warmth of sunlight on his face. At last the day had come. He stretched to work out the kinks in his joints and muscles and groaned at the throbbing in his head. On his nightstand lay a bottle of Dornish red, which he downed in one long swallow to clear his mind, wine dribbling down his beard and tunic. He spied the book at the corner of his room where he had hurled it, and nearly threw the bottle too as the rage resurfaced along with his senses.The book was called A Dance with Dragons, a book that he had vowed to write a review for to publish on Amazon.com. The ending had left him dazed and confused the night before, and he longed to leech the foulness from his blood in the form of a scathing review to warn others of the horrifying tedium that awaited them. But first...His bladder was full to burst, and he propelled himself to the privy to relieve himself of his heavy load. A steaming stream shot from his hose like the boiling vomit of a sick dragon; far more than what he had anticipated. He counted five and ten seconds gone by as he continued to shoot and spurt, and when it ended he sighed in satisfaction. He shook off the last drops and pulled up his smallclothes, mission accomplished, but what was this...His tummy rumbled.A dragon's roar erupted from his hind quarters, a sound that bellowed like the wet cheeks of thunder itself. The smell was revolting, and flakes of brown and bubbling slime oozed down his legs like gravy.\"Farts are wind.\" He chuckled, saliva running down his beard and undershirt.CHAPTER ONEHe opened his refrigerator to check its contents. He was hungry, and he was not going to write his review until he was full and sated. Much and more can be done in a day, and he wasn't about to rush himself.Within were foods beyond count and description, but he was going to try anyway. Two cartons of eggs sat at the top shelf, each carton containing sixteen shells filled with delicious yolk and white. On the shelf below there were meats of every kind: ham and beef and pork, bacon and roast beef and steak, enough to make his mouth water and his stomach jiggle with hunger winds. Yogurts dominated the third shelf of at least three different brands and ten different flavors. Orange juice, apple juice, grape juice, juice of every fruit and flavor. He would not go thirsty, mayhaps. There were also cakes of cheese and chocolate and strawberry short, as well as pies of apple and custard for when he tired of cake. Winter may come, but he would not go hungry. The bottom shelves were for vegetables, cabbages and carrots, broccoli and lettuce, tomatoes and...what...\"Neeps? What the hell are neeps?\" He shrugged.He broke his fast on fried neeps and bacon, scooping them up in week old hard bread that he hollowed out and used as a trencher. He tipped the delicious soup into his mouth, bits of neep and bacon grease running down his chin and robe. When that was done he ate the trencher too, the soggy crumbs clinging to his facial hair. He mopped up the excess grease with his beard, saving it for future consumption. If there was anything he hated more than procrastination, it was wastefulness.His review was in his mind. He yearned to write it, as that was his true purpose and he despised these bothersome distractions! But first, he had to travel. Surely there was plenty of time. Much and more can be done in a day, after all. Much and more.CHAPTER FIVEThe ship sailed down the river.In truth, he was not on a ship, nor was he in a river. But he had always longed to go sailing, and if he could, he would write about it incessantly and without restraint. But as of now, he drove a car, and while there was no river, there was a road, a long strip of gray asphalt that continued on to the vast horizon, leading to his destination, wherever that would be, and oh the Seven only knew when he would get there. The cement was cracked and the paint that divided it chipped and faded, mayhaps from age and use. The buildings passed by in a vague blur, but he could not pay attention to them now. He had to look ahead, or risk getting lost at sea. If I look left I am lost.Like the outstretched hand of a giant, a red light loomed before him, forcing him to stop in his tracks. There were three lights in all, red and orange and green. They played in sequence, herding the ships about like kings in an ocean court. He wanted to push on past that oppressive red god, but he knew to do so would be a one way ticket to the black cells. And the jail was dark and full of terrors.He could not afford to risk that, to be held captive for the tenth time like some onion smuggler. He had a review to write, and no time to waste. But he would get there, he assured himself. He only had to sail - drive - thrice more. But first comes the setup, and then he would put his pieces to play.CHAPTER THIRTY\"Good morning, sir. It's good to see you again!\"\"Hello, wench.\" He greeted. On the counter was an assortment of goods and food products. He had enumerated them in excruciating detail the chapter before, but he saw no reason not to do so again. Packs of lunchables were stacked like a mountain of prepared meals to lazily break his fasts on on the counter before him. Jugs of milk stood next to them, flanked by bags of cookies and crackers in varying brands and flavors. And oh R'hllord the cheese! Sliced cheese, round cheese, white cheese, blue cheese, string cheese and cream cheese. New pieces of hardbread were grouped to the side, of which he would use as trenchers when they become old and tough as rocks. And-\"That would be thirty-six fifty, sir.\", said the wench.\"What?\"\"Thirty six fifty. I rang them up while you were describing them. I like to pretend we're racing. I always win though.\" She smiled.\"Ah, I see.\" His eyes squinted at her, as if seeing her for the first time. Her hair was the color of straw and flowed past her shoulders and held in a band with a cute lion face (LANNISTER!) so as not to be obtrusive, culminating in a widow's peak at her hairline. Her eyes were like brown m&m's swimming in puddles of fresh milk. She wore a white blouse slashed with yellow with the top two buttons open. Her bosom was impressive, and on the left was a nametag.\"Darianne. Oh Darianne! How have I not noticed you before!\", he crooned.\"Um...I don't know. We see eachother everyday...you like to describe your purchases while I-\"\"Silence! Don't speak! You have awakened the dragon, and oh how he roars. I wish to sit for ten chapters straight and repeat your name! Darianne! Darianne! Darianne! And please, call me nuncle!\" Suddenly he shook his head, and his eyes focusing and his gut retracting, as if waking up from a terrible spell. \"No, I must not! I have a review to write, and these random romantic dalliances will only waste time!\" But as if succumbing to an invisible force that filled with extreme laziness, his eyes glossed over and his stomach spilled over his belt, and once again he was lost. \"Please, take me through your Myrish swamp!\"\"...\"CHAPTER 52 - 88\"Go Giants!\"CHAPTER 89It had been a long day, longer than the longest of books, longer than even the longest installments of the most epic of epic sagas. There had been many distractions along the way (through no fault of mine!), many foods to enumerate and much sailing - driving - to do, and he was contented to immerse himself in all of it. But the end had come at last; there was no more time for those distractions. It was time for the climax, and he must needs go with a bang. If there was actually anyone waiting, this was the moment they were waiting for.He sat in his chair, facing the computer screen, ready to write his review. The time was twelve and twenty, his cheek still stinging from the slap Darianne had given him, and his fingers flexed and ached to at last express what he felt after reading A Dance with Dragons. He glanced at the mirror hanging at his side, and for a fraction of a second he glimpsed the face of a rotund old man with a snowy white beard wearing a newsboy hat and an NFL jersey, who somehow reminded him of a greedy Santa. He shook his head. He must be weary from lack of writing.His fingers twitched over the keyboard, eyes glued forward at the screen. There was no shirking it now. The end would have to come. No more excuses. It was the end of the road. The final countdown. Duh duh DUHduh, duhduh duhduhDUH! The \"setup\" was complete, and his characters waited in place, ready to make their moves. This was the moment he had spent an entire day and one thousand figurative pages preparing for. At last the day had come. His beard smelled awful. A Dance With Dragons was...He wrote a word."

        "user_review": "ENGLISH (A Dance with Dragons) / ITALIANOThe fifth chapter of \"A song of ice and fire\" is yet another confirmation thatGeorge R.R. Martin, in the field of the epic-medieval fantasy, is the most worthy successor ofJ.R.R. Tolkien. The universe molded by Martin is described with a manic cure and with so many details that some readers are rather disappointed, accusing the work to be too long and/or boring. I do not agree. Game of Thrones has become what we today know exactly thanks to the painful precision of the author in painting the houses and the mechanisms that regulate their everyday life. The meticulous work done by Martin to draw up the genealogy of the main houses accompanying each volume recalls once again to Tolkien. At the moment, my reading experience is so immersive that I would probably guess the noble family of any new character only from the description of his ethics and behaviors. This means in my opinion that Martin has created a world, and he did it damn well.«Life is not a ballad»the bitter thought of Theon the \"turncoat\", the outcast Geyjoy, beautifully contrasts with the fact that Game of Thrones is one of the most beautiful ballads that contemporary literature has given us.Lannister, Baratheon, Targaryen, Stark, Greyjoy, Bolton, Martell and many other houses continue their game for power constantly passing through alliances and betrayal, in which you can not trust anyone, not even your own children. The only voice out of the chorus is that of Jon Snow, who is not able to make everybody around him understand that there will be no Iron Throne to conquer unless the dark presence beyond the Barrier, the Enemy of all, will not be overthrown. Therefore, long life to George Martin. I hope he will leave his mortal coil at least in one hundred years. And not before finalizingA Song of Ice and Fire.Winter is coming.Aye.Vote: 8Quinto capitolo delle cronache del ghiaccio e del fuoco ed ennesima conferma che il successore più degno diJ.R.R. Tolkienin materia di fantasy epico-medievale èGeorge R.R. Martin. L'universo plasmato da Martin è descritto con una cura maniacale, con una dovizia di dettagli che fanno storcere il naso a molti lettori, che accusano l'opera di essere lunga e/o noiosa. Non sono d'accordo. Il Trono di Spade è diventato quello che conosciamo grazie alla morbosa precisione dell'autore nel dipingere le casate e i meccanismi che ne regolano la vita quotidiana, più che gli eventi. Molto\"tolkieniano\"è anche il lavoro svolto a stilare la genealogia delle principali casate a corredo di ciascun volume. A questo punto della lettura, la mia esperienza è stata talmente \"immersiva\" che riuscirei probabilmente ad indovinare la nobile famiglia di appartenenza di un qualsiasi nuovo personaggio solo dalla descrizione che l'autore fa della sua etica e dei suoi comportamenti. Per me questo significa che Martin ha creato un mondo, e l'ha fatto bene.«La vita non è una ballata»è l'amaro pensiero di Theon, il voltagabbana, il reietto Greyjoy. Strano, perchè Il Trono di Spade è una delle più belle ballate che la letteratura contemporanea ci ha donato.Lannister, Baratheon, Targaryen, Stark, Greyjoy, Bolton, Martell e tante altre casate continuano il loro gioco per il potere fatto di alleanze e tradimenti continui, in cui non ci si può fidare di nessuno, nemmeno dei propri figli. Unica voce fuori dal coro è quella del povero Jon Snow, che non riesce a far capire a chi gli sta intorno che non ci sarà nessun trono di spade per cui combattere se non verrà arginata l'oscura presenza oltre la Barriera, il Nemico di tutti. Pertanto, lunga vita a George Martin, che possa abbandonare le sue spoglie mortali tra cent'anni almeno. E non prima di aver terminato il Trono di Spade.L'inverno sta arrivando.Aye.Voto: 8"

And there's a jumbo hotdog coming out on the 12th, so yay. Come the twelfth, all you get is the bread, and they say, eat that, the sausage is coming. It's so meaty, you're already salivating, dribbling on yourself in public like a fool.Munch, munch, munch. But the bread is dry... Then you come upon a sausage factory. The Jumbo Sausage factory, and you get a grand tour, up and down every aisle, seeing the ins and out of sausage world, how they grind the meat, and all the health precautions and what-not.At the end of the tour, you get a frozen ketchup packet. Half the day is gone, and you've seen the jumbo sausage showcased in the window but all you get is dry bread and a ketchup pack that promises to melt in the next five to ten years.See how long-winded, pointless and totally irrelevant that was? It don't have nothing on ADWD.I used to like Tyrion, but he spent half the book rowing down a river, and the other half wiping a man's ass.Dany, reminds me of Brionny from Shadowmarch - clothes, food, suitors galore and loving servants willing to eat a sword for her. Dragons too, for about 50 pages, but mostly just food and tokars.Jon, hopefully dead. Yes, I said it. I used to like Jon, but he turned into a wilding-lover, an idiot, and a Stannis enthusiast. He knew nothing, Jon Snow.And those three make up 90% of the book.Theon was good, until the repetitive nature of his POV became boring.BTW, Aegon is still alive, which isn't really a shocker since the whole \"There must be one more\" vision, but we see him for all of five minutes. His bodyguard, the only truly interesting POV in the series gets two chapters. They are the only people who accomplish anything, and they do the majority off-page.One Jaime chapter, which was more pointless than Tyrion's stint as a pig-riding slave, if such a level of pointlessness is possible. The two Cersei chapters read nice, but are still pointless, (we've had enough introspection from her, right? Time for the trial/axman/exile).The whole thing is one massive filler that makes AFFC look like 5 star stuff.1000 pages plus? 90% based in Asia/Persia/Egypt/Greece/wherever the eff Meereen is supposed to be beside a cesspit. It's a literal cesspit... literally. That pale mare is going to leave its hoof prints on your soul. Raise your hand if you want the entire continent burnt to the ground! Who cares?I feel as if someone farted in my brain. And gave it the flux. Or if GRRM had the flux while he was writing this.Winds of winter though is poised to be beautiful, at least. Hopefully no more Wall, and no more Meereen, but I get a feeling we still have some \"Selmy's Round Table Rule\" to mock through.Victarion was in it, but he was on a boat too. Asha wasn't on a boat, but she was in the snow. Everybody was either in the snow, on a boat, or getting married and eating food. Even people get married in the snow.One star for Aegon, the next star for Bran and the Bloodraven cameo. A thousand eyes and one... That was nice.Imagine a morbidly obese Brad Pitt. (Upwards of 600lbs.) That's what ASOIAF is right now.It'll take one hell of a fix up to return it to its former glory. TWOWshouldbe good, but then ADDW was supposed to be good too, right? Am I holding my breath?"

        "user_review": "So where were the dancing dragons?This book was so bad. Not a single dragon danced once. I'm so disappointed. Gosh! I may not even read the next one! You call that dancing?I'm, of course, kidding. When the next book comes out I will devour it in an angry sort of way. It's been far, far, far, too long.Well, I should say \"if\" the next book comes out. But, let's not go there it is far too painful to think about. I'm annoyed at the wait. I'll curse George R.R. Martin for leaving me in suspense, but I'll then praise his name whilst I'm reading again.Enough of that, let's talk about this book. This really wasn't Dany's finest hour. It seems like everything she has created has fallen apart in her absence. Every Queenly decision she has made has backfired on her. Her people are angry with her; they're turning against her, and she can do little to prevent it. Here resides a massive flaw within her character. She has the strength to inspire, but she does not have the wisdom to rule effectively and efficiently. Her decisions are not constant. Some are governed by mercy and empathy whereas others are guided by cold logic and revenge. There is no sense of right or wrong anymore. She doesn't know what to do. Instead of governing by an effective amount of either, she governs with a touch of both which is completely detrimental to her rule. She looks like a foolish despot.What she needs is advice, what she needs is a friend; what she needs is some with the wisdom to help guide her compassion: what she needs is Tyrion Lannister. We all know is half way to her in this book. In the show he's already there. But, I can't wait to see it happen on the page. I can't wait to see him guide her back to Westeros, join up with the reanimated Jon Snow, kick some ass and join ice with fire. Well, that's what I want to see happen. Though in reality, something much more unusual will likely happen. What I want to see feels a like lot a typical plot line; it sounds like an obvious route for this to go down. George R.R Martin likes to be unpredictable, so it will probably end with something unforeseen, which will hopefully be better. I want to be surprised in the ending despite my investment with these characters.Well, either way, I want to see Dany get the ending she deserves. I feel like she is the character who has, arguably, gone through the most; yes, all the characters have a rough time, but she has an especially rough time. She's got a lot resting on her shoulders. I'm hoping she learns from her mistakes in Mereen, and uses them to benefit her possible rule is Westeros. Hopefully, she, with the help of Tyrion, will unite Westeros and destroy the Others.I did enjoy this book, and the one before it, though the plot didn't progress a great deal in either. It's quite worrying to think that this story could be concluded in two books. I mean….if it's another two like these two, where would that leave us?A Song of Ice and Fire1.A Game of Thrones-A life chnaging five stars2.A Clash of Kings-An Impish five stars3.A Storm of Swords-A Lannister loving five stars4.A Feast for Crows-A flat 3.5 stars5.A Dance with Dragons-A convoluted four stars6.The Winds of Winter-Will I ever read you?I think it's become far too big with unnecessary point of view characters. That's why I knocked my rating down a star; the book was very convoluted. I'm hoping with the rest of the series there is a focus back onto the main characters. Well, at this point, I'm hoping that this series actually gets an ending in the first place. As the years goes on it becomes less and less likely. I will be keeping my fingers crossed, waving my three headed dragon banner and wishing for Dany to finally take back what is hers."

        "user_review": "Martin himself describes the writing process of Feast: 'The last one was a bitch.\" and of ADWD: \"This one was three bitches and a bastard\". If the author had trouble writing it It's not surprising that it is also \"three bitches and a bastard\" to read. Presumably the first 3 books were easier to write, I also found them far more enjoyable to read.I think part of my difficulty with reading ADWD is my refusal to skip anything, I never felt this urge to in the 1st 3 books. I read this today and thought it was very applicable, in his essay \"The Art of Fiction\" Sommerset Maughm writes: \"The wise reader will get the greatest enjoyment … if he learns the useful art of skipping. A sensible person does not read a novel as a task. He is prepared to interest himself in the characters… and what happens to them, he sympathises with their troubles and is gladdened by their joys. But he knows instinctively where his interest lies and he follows it as surely as a hound follows the scent of a fox. Sometimes, through the author's failure, he loses the scent. Then he flounders about till he finds it again. He skips\"My interests are in Westeros, not in Mereen. I didn't feel the urge to skip in the Theon, Jon or Davos chapters. With Dany, Jon and Tyrion's character regression from the end of ASOS I have lost interest and sympathy with them. Its not a very plausible or thoroughly fleshed out setting, unlike Westeros with full family trees, coast of arms and centuries of history. As a reader I am floundering in these chapters because the author floundered in these chapters. Generally I can enjoy brilliant prose with zero plot. However Martin's excessive repetition of phrases is jarring. So to is his increasing use of inconsistent faux-medieval invented/adapted words (serjeant, neeps, needs must, nuncle) it does not make for good prose.In his 1st 3 books Martin avoided the fantasy tropes of unkillable farmboy saves the world. Now he has fallen victim of his own tropes, with comic-book like cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter and countless characters having soap-opera like resurrections. The realistic feudal medieval world of the early books is now replaced with an Orientalist flawed Eastern continent with none of the depth of the Westeros he created. Supernatural and fantasty elements are also prevalent, often as a tool for weak plot. Sadism, swearing and \"grimdark\" elements have also increased which is also in my opinion MArtin falling into his own tropes and not to the benefit of the prose or story.I have only just finished ADWD but others seemed to have finished very quickly, I suspect they skipped many Tyrion and Dany bits and probably found the whole experience more enjoyable.The Martin in the first 3 books is no longer the Martin of these last two. ADWD continues the drop in quality that came with FfC, I hope returns to enjoying writing the next 2 (or 3) so I can enjoy reading them again!"

        "user_review": "This was a struggle between what I wanted to feel and what I felt.I'm not going to lay false claim to being an early convert to George R.R. Martin'sA Song of Ice and Firecycle. To the contrary, up until April 17, 2011, I spent a great deal of time passively ignoring fantasy in general, and Martin in particular. (By passively ignoring, I mean I lived my daily life without ever thinking about the topic). However, on that date, HBO premieredGame of Thrones. Within three minutes, people were being decapitated, and my interest was piqued.I bought the first book,A Game of Thrones, finished it, and waited a couple days before ordering the second,A Clash of Kings. In the interim, I stopped eating, threw other, lesser novels in the trash, and started sporting a hobo's beard. When the second book arrived, I tore into it. By the time I reached the last fifty pages, I belatedly realized I needed to order the next installment,A Storm of Swords. (At this point I still thought I could kick the habit, and go back to a world where books that didn't feature castles, swords with names, and endless wine flagons could hold my interest).There was a daylong lag between finishingKingsand receivingSwords. During that 24 hour period, I experienced intense symptoms of anxiety, agitation, and sleeplessness. In other words, I went through the same withdrawal as your garden-variety crystal meth user. By the time I startedSwords, the fourth book,A Feast for Crows, was already in the mail. Thus, I had a smooth transition between book three and four, which is to say that I stopped mutteringI don't want to read other books ever againevery time I looked at my bookshelf.Due partially to good timing, and partially to luck, I completedCrowsshortly before the release of Martin's long-awaited fifth book,A Dance With Dragons. I went to work on the release date, signed out sick at lunch, drove to Barnes & Noble, and spent the rest of the day in Westeros.All this is to say that I was excited for the release ofDragons. Indeed, when I woke up the morning of the release date, I was in a state bordering on giddy; it may be worth adding that giddiness is not a state I visit often.Of course, my excitement doesn't hold a candle to the fervor of the true fans, the ones who've been reading Martin since he first createdA Song of Ice and Fire.The first three novels came out two years apart, starting in 1996. FollowingSwords, in 2000, however, the gestational phase for Martin's writing turned glacial.Crowsdid not come out for five years, and when it did, it landed with a thud. It had grown so large that Martin split the story in half; instead of dividing things chronologically, though, he did so by character. This meant that many fan favorites – Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys – did not appear inCrows. Even worse, Martin stated in an afterward that the next volume –Dragons– would be arriving the next year.Six years later, that was true.So it's been six years since Brienne was left hanging by the neck at the end ofCrows. And it's been more than a decade since we've spent any appreciable time with the main triumvirate of Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys. That's a lot of years for readers thirsting to know what happens next. Though I hadn't been there from the start, I counted myself among the insatiable.I counted down the days, checked Martin's blog, and when they started coming out, I read every early review, spoilers be damned. To a one, they were positive: Glowing. Effusive. Filled with praise. Yet almost all of them also had abut. \"It's a great book, but…\" \"Fans should be totally satisfied, but…\"When I finally started reading, thebutswere the farthest thing from my mind. I'm not what you'd call an overly optimistic person; still, Martin had done enough to earn my trust. It took me till page 500 before a bit of doubt crept in; I did my best to suppress that. By page 700, the doubts had turned to a dull roar.On page 913, it hit me: nothing was going to save this experience.Dragonsis a disappointment. More than that, it's aStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace-like disappointment. This is a book you want to like. No, that's wrong. This is a book you want tolove. I'm sure plenty of readers will love it. Or they'll say they did. I'm just unsure how real that love is. The alternative is bleak: a six year wait only to discover that Martin blew it; that his story has spun out of control; that despite nearly 1,000 pages, the plot doesn't move an inch. I see now why the wordbutkept creeping into those reviews.The plot forDragonspicks up whereSwordsended and runs concurrent (at least for the first half) withCrows(in an early scene, between Samwell and Jon, we are treated to a conversation held inCrows, though this time it is told from Jon's point of view, rather than Sam).As with all the other books in this series,Dragonsis told from the third-person limited point of view, through the eyes of select \"viewpoint characters\" that alternate with each chapter. Back inThrones, there were only eight viewpoint characters, which gave you depth without scope. That is, the limited points of view allowed you to become intensely connected to the featured characters; however, many of these characters were in the same geographical area, which meant that a lot of action took place offstage, and was related through exposition. At times, it was like looking at Westeros through a keyhole.InDragons, there are a whopping sixteen viewpoint characters. This means you get great coverage of Martin's world. He has now put boots on the ground in every corner of the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. On the other hand, there's very little chance to grow connected to some of these newer additions. For instance, characters such as Areo Hotah, Victarion Greyjoy, and Quentyn Martell flit past so quickly, they barely register an impression.Right off the bat, Martin addresses the main criticism ofCrowsby treating us to successive chapters on Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys. Indeed, these three comprise the bulk ofDragonschapters and length. Unfortunately, their mere inclusion is not enough to save the day.Of these three, only Tyrion is still mobile. Long regarded as Martin's greatest creation, Tyrion retains that distinction, if only because there are no other viable contenders. Tyrion, the Imp, is the dwarf son of a rich and powerful father, whom Tyrion killed inSwords. As always, Tyrion makes his way with a slashing wit, boundless confidence, and an unflagging desire for whores and booze. Part of Tyrion's appeal – which is testament to Martin's plotting – is that Tyrion is always dynamic. InThrones, we underestimated Tyrion, who seemed a smart-assed, half-crippled bundle of hedonistic principles. InKings, Tyrion was given a position of power, and used it wisely, displaying martial ingenuity along with flashes of humanity. BySwords, Tyrion's power had been stripped, and he was engaged in battle of wits with his sister and father. The result is that Tyrion's character has never settled; Martin has kept him on his toes, thereby engaging our interest.That holds true inDragons. Following his escape from King's Landing, Tyrion embarks on a journey across the Narrow Sea, to find Daenerys Targaryen. I won't get into detail about his trek, as it contains plot spoilers. Suffice it to say, beyond the surprises and reveals, there are many nice moments to Tyrion's story, including a haunting boat ride past old Volantis, and a touching companionship with Penny, a fellow dwarf. Tyrion is still brash and funny and the bearer of a slightly-skewed moral compass. That I'm beginning to tire of him probably has more to do with the fact that he's an old friend, and I'm overly familiar with all his tricks and quirks. (Alas, Martin's attempt to frame Tyrion's quest as a way to find his place in the world is cringingly pat).Unlike Tyrion, Jon and Daenerys are rooted in place.Jon is on the Wall, where he remains throughout the entirety ofDragons. His conflict has to do with wannabe-king Stannis Baratheon, the red priestess Melisandre, and the hordes of wildlings that Jon has to resettle south of the Wall. The problem with Jon is that he's become a dull, stuffy hypocrite, in thrall to his own perceived rectitude. Despite spending much ofStormsas a traitor, riding, eating, and sleeping with the wildlings (and by sleeping with, I mean boinking), Jon is still convinced of his own rightness. ThroughoutDragons, his modus operandi as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch is to stiffly inform Stannis that he is not allowed to help him; then he helps Stannis; and later, he rationalizes those actions to himself. This is repeated on a loop until the book ends.Meanwhile, Daenerys is stuck in Meereen with her army. The invasion that began with such promise inStormshas become a quagmire. While this may be a trenchant commentary on America's current military adventures in the Middle East, it creates a resounding narrative lull (about the only action in Meereen comes from the dragons, one of which gets loose and begins poaching children).Daenerys has chosen to stay in Meereen, despite all strategic advice to the contrary, because she wants to care for her people (whom she describes as \"children\" with queenly condescension). At a gut level, I disliked her for this stance. From the beginning ofA Song of Ice and Fire, Martin has expounded on the theme of power and politics. Time and again, Martin has rewarded the purveyors of KissingerianRealpolitik(such as Tywin Lannister) to the detriment of Stevensonian idealists (such as the late Eddard and Robb Stark). I spent much ofDragonsannoyed with Daenerys for not making the tough, brutal, pragmatic choices that would allow her to win. Having given the notion a bit more thought, I realize that Daenerys actually deserves a bit of credit for having the most finely tuned moral sense of any other character. She is, after all, trying to help the poor, close the fighting pits, and free the slaves (even though Martin's other characters make such a persuasive case for slavery I got a little uncomfortable). Still, Daenerys' goodness is not a substitute for plot. As with Jon at the Wall, Daenerys' chapters are eye-glazingly cyclical: in each one, she is badgered to do something by an advisor or courtier; she gives a little ground while still holding to her principles; later, she is proven wrong; and the whole charade begins again.The other viewpoint characters are a mixed batch. The connecting theme with most of them is a desire to reach Daenerys in Meereen. The highlights include Bran, growing into his shape-shifting abilities; Arya training with the Faceless Men (and moving farther from the light); Ser Barristan Selmy at the twilight of his career, filled with regret yet still capable of kicking ass; and Cersei Lannister, who is forced to undergo an excruciatingly riveting trial by shame, which duly whet my appetite for her eventual vengeance.On the other hand, I don't care for the Greyjoys or the Martells. They were introduced too late into the series for me to have any profound connection. Moreover, their arcs and characterizations are uninspired. (There are two viewpoint characters for whom discussion would involve potential spoilers. Suffice it to say, one of these characters represents some of Martin's best work; the other embodies just the opposite).If it's not clear, my main criticism inDragonsis that nothing much happens. There is no action. It's a lot of people walking and talking and drinking and eating skewered meat. In other words, it's like a Renaissance Faire. But at least a Ren Faire has a joust. Here, in the midst of all that walking (and riding and boating) and talking, there are precious few battles, swordfights, fisticuffs or gratuitous sex scenes. I almost longed for a scene of depressingly low taste, such as the incestuous flirtation between Asha and Theon inKings.To make matters worse, Martin (formerly a writer forThe Twilight Zone) employs a cheap serial style that only serves to emphasize how little is happening. Each individual chapter follows the same general outline, just like a serialized drama. The viewpoint character is introduced; the character has a flashback that explains what he or she has been doing lately; the current narrative thread is joined; and finally, a conflict will arise. Just as something is about to happen, Martin will end the chapter with a cliffhanger. (One chapter ends with a character drawing his sword, just as a fight is about to start). This style is a huge miscalculation. After awhile, I became resigned to the fact that nothing would ever happen until the last page. Instead of action, I'd be forever plunging forward, looking for a resolution that never came (or if it came, it'd be so far forward in the book that I couldn't remember the cliffhanger to begin with).To be sure,Dragonsis better thanCrows. The writing is more sure-handed, unlikeCrowswhich seemed carved out by an editor. Yet there is a distinct drop-off fromSwords. The descriptions aren't as fresh; the dialogue isn't as sharp; the plotting isn't as intricate. Maybe this is a function of the series' length, but cracks are beginning to show. I started to notice the clichés, the lazy phrases, the writerly tics. For instance, in the span of two pages, Martin twice describes a character saying words that left \"a bitter taste\" in her mouth (in all my life, I've never tasted a single word; apparently, this character feasts upon them). The dialogue, which once had a pulpy, almost Mamet-like pungency to it, has become pretty lousy. There are still some decent monologues, but the exchanges have devolved from evocative to exclamatory (and sometimes just lame; two different characters declaim that such and such a person is \"as useless as nipples on a breastplate\"). The leitmotifs, which used to be as simple and as elegant as \"winter is coming,\" are now heavy-handed (\"words are wind\") or crude (\"where do whores go\"). Even the names have gotten worse. We used to have good, solid, muscular names, such as Bran or Ned or Robert or even the androgynous-yet-uncomplicated Jaime. Now, the reader is forced to make sense of unpronounceable collections of consonants and increasingly ridiculous aptronyms (Bloodbeard? Really?).(Anyone who doubts my qualitative critique of Martin's writing should find someone to read aloud to them from a Daenerys chapter. After a few sentences of stumbling over names and reciting exclamation-point-dotted sentences will prove my point).I don't think I'm giving anything away by telling you there is a cliffhanger at the end ofDragons. By the time I got there, I didn't care at all.See, inDragons, as in Martin's other books, major characters die. Or at least they appear to die. Back inSwords, Martin brutally killed off Catelyn and Robb Stark at the Red Wedding (and had Robb's decapitated body decorated by Robb's wolf's head). Since then, Martin has shown a preference for fake-killing his characters, tricking his readers into believing someone is dead before having that character reappear at a convenient moment. By this point, Martin has resurrected more people than Jesus. When people died inDragons, I just shook my head and made my wagers as to when that person would show up.The biggest problem withDragonsis that it didn't fulfill what I needed it to fulfill. In other words, I set forDragonsan impossible task, and reacted with surprise when it could not complete it. Yet my expectations – and the expectations of millions of others – are part and parcel of Martin's grand enterprise. He set the bar very high for himself. It is becoming increasingly clear that he is wilting from that pressure. Instead of narrowing his story and focusing on its fundamentals, he has let the narrative explode. Instead of fine tuning plot points, he keeps throwing more plotlines into the mix. He's like some juggler who keeps adding pins to distract you from the fact that he's not wearing pants.The most damning indictment I can giveDragonsis that I finished it a week after it came out, but didn't get around to the review until now. In those weeks, I have not missed it. Furthermore, I have not once thought about how long I'll have to wait until the next one. With his exceedingly long turnout time, Martin has set me up to stop caring.I don't know where I'll be in five or six or seven years (it is a terrifying prospect to behold); still, I'm pretty certain thatA Song of Ice and Firewon't have a special place in my heart. Too many things will have happened. By that time,Dragonswill be a distant memory: a book read by a different person in a different world. If the next book gets written, I may pick it up (or have it uploaded directly into my brain, if that's how things are done in the future), but it won't be the same experience. For me, the vibrancy is gone. If I move forward with the series, it will probably be out of a sense of nostalgia."

        "user_review": "Wow! Another one down! Each of these books are so incredibly long that it feels like a major accomplishment to complete them. I feel like I should get a merit badge or something.Nonetheless, this epic saga continues. While I didn't see a lot of forward movement, I appreciated the time spent with some of my favorite characters. Mr. Martin is not one to spare details, and this book is full of them.That being said, I spent a lot of time feeling lost. As if there weren't enough characters already, Mr. Martin continues to add even more side stories to this epic adventure. Maybe I'm missing something or just lack the insight to understand the workings of his brilliant mind, but I found many of these extra details to be trivial and irrelevant. I'm having enough trouble keeping the major characters straight. I certainly didn't need more added to the mix!Unlike book 4, this fifth book offers plenty of time with Dany and the dragons. This was a major plus for me, since Dany is my favorite character in the series thus far. I particularly enjoyed the way she finally embraces her dragons. I have an image in my mind of her flying through the sky on the back of her dragon that leaves me dying to get my hands on the next book.However, this book also showed the less confident side of Dany. She often struggled in her role as Queen, failing to make wise decisions. As her advisors have been whittled down, her ability to be the effective leader that she wants to be has declined. Many of the changes she implemented seemed to unravel in this book. Although, by the end of the book I had a renewed sense of optimism where Dany is concerned.'A Dance With Dragons' also features Cersei finally getting a taste of her own medicine. She is a character that I love to hate and seeing her brought down a few pegs was long overdue. If for no other reason, I would've read this gigantic book just to see her public humiliation and degradation. It was so worth it!Tyrion also reappears in this book. He's slowly making his way to Dany...and boy does she ever need him! Although his recent life events have made him even more aware of his expendability, he continues to be highly entertaining and incredibly wise.I am curious to see where this epic adventure is heading. It seems that these worlds are about to collide and I can only hope that my favorite characters don't begin killing each other off. Now that I've finished this book, I guess I can join the wait!As a side-note, I can say that the differences between the books and the HBO series are becoming more apparent the further along the series gets. Some of the events happen out of sequence and some things are added in that haven't happened yet. However, I'm still enjoying both immensely."

        "user_review": "At the risk of getting thoroughly stomped by series fans, this was the first book where I really felt \"it was ok\" is the best I can say of it. It's wildly scattered all over the landscape of the current story, both in term of physical location and in terms of characters. There are so many new characters, new armies, new leaders, new kings, new slaves, new queens, and new vicious psychopaths that it's impossible to keep track of everyone, even if I wanted to. I know fans will say that's what the list of characters is for, but my *personal* attitude is that I don't like flipping back and forth in the book every time I forget who someone was four chapters ago.I feel as if the hole Martin got himself into when Danaerys chose to settle in one city rather than keep moving has expanded into a massive, unmanageable trap that it's going to be well-nigh impossible to write his way out of for any of the characters caught there. I feel the introduction of other contenders for her crown and the Iron Throne has pulled the story away from its central core and that most of this book could have been cut with no detriment to the main story at all. I feel the story's momentum has slowed to a complete crawl.Please don't yell at me for not loving the book or for questioning the series.This is my opinion,and it's the opinion of someone who's read the first four books twice. I've waded through a lot of gore, viciousness, woman-bashing, flaying, and cannibalism to get this far without a peep. (And please don't tell me there was a lot of rape in the middle ages. If that reasoning's going to be used, may I point out there weren't zombies, dragons, or White Walkers in the middle ages.) I do wonder if Mr. Martin isn't gaming the plot out, which at least would explain why it's gone so meander-y. Maybe it'll tighten up in the next book. I hope so. If it doesn't, or I lose one more character that I've been hanging on for, I am outie."

        "user_review": "A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire #5), George R.R. MartinA Dance with Dragons is the fifth of seven planned novels in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by American author George R. R. Martin. In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance, beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind. Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone, a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice. From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skin-changers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.ترجمه فارسی در سه جلد چاپ شده استتاریخ نخستین خوانش کتاب اول:روز بیست و هشتم ماه ژوئن سال2015میلادیتاریخ نخستین خوانش کتاب دوم: روز ششم ماه جولای سال2015میلادیتاریخ نخستین خوانش کتاب سوم از روز ششم ماه جولای سال2015میلادی تا روز دوازدهم جولای سال2015میلادیعنوان: نغمه آتش و یخ جلد پنج؛ رقص با اژدهاها کتاب اول؛ نویسنده: جرج آر.آر مارتین؛ مترجم رویا خادم الرضا؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر ویدا، سال1394، در542ص، شابک9786002911599؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21معنوان: نغمه آتش و یخ جلد پنج رقص با اژدهاها کتاب دوم؛ نویسنده: جرج آر.آر مارتین؛ مترجم رویا خادم الرضا؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر ویدا، سال1394، در552ص، شابک9786002911360؛عنوان: نغمه آتش و یخ جلد پنج رقص با اژدهاها کتاب سوم؛ نویسنده: جرج آر.آر مارتین؛ مترجم: رویا خادم الرضا؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر ویدا، سال1394، در551 ص، شابک9786002911377؛یکی از بهترین کتابهای سری «نغمه ی آتش و یخ» است؛ برگردان کتاب «رقص با اژدهاها» در «ایران»، مجموعه ای سه جلدی و پنجمین عنوان از «حماسه ی نغمه آتش و یخ»، نوشته ی «جرج آر.آر مارتین» است، که نخستین بار در سال2011میلادی وارد بازار نشر شد؛ پس از نبردی بزرگوار و خونین، آینده ی پادشاهیِ هفتگانه از هر سو با تهدید روبروست؛ در شرق، «دِنِریس»، آخرین بازمانده از خاندان «تارگِریَن»، به عنوان ملکه ی شهری ساخته شده از غبار و مرگ، با سه اژدهای خود حکمرانی میکند؛ اما «دنریس»، دشمنان بیشماری دارد، و بسیاری میخواهند او را پیدا کنند و از بین ببرند؛ «تیریِن لنیستر» نیز که در حال فرار از «وِستِروس» است، تلاش میکند تا خود را به «دنریس» برساند؛ دیواری بزرگ از یخ و سنگ از شمال نگاهبانی میکند؛ سازه ای که استحکام آن، درست به میزان توان نگاهبانانش است؛ در آنجا، «جان اسنو»، نهصد و نود و هشتمی�� فرمانده ی محافظین شب، با بزرگترین چالش زندگی اش مواجه خواهد شد، چرا که دشمنانی توانمند، نه تنها در میان نگاهبانان بلکه در پشت دیوار، و در سرزمین موجودات یخی، انتظار نابودی او را میکشند؛ نبردهای خونین از هر گوشه و کنار، دوباره شعله ور میشوند، خیانتهایی ناباورانه رقم میخورند و گروهی بزرگ از مجرمان، کشیشان، سربازان، جادوگران، اشراف و بردگان با موانعی به ظاهر غیرقابل عبور مواجه میشوند؛ برخی، شکست خواهند خورد و برخی دیگر با سود بردن از توان تاریکی، قد عَلَم خواهند کرد؛ اما در زمانِ هرج و مرجهای فزاینده، امواج سرنوشت و سیاست، بی تردید و به شکلی اجتناب ناپذیر به ب��رگترین رقصِ ممکن خواهند انجامیدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "So, this is it. The dragons were supposed to dance, instead they barely spread their wings. And I am left thinking, this is it?!?My complaint by the way, is not about the wait itself. I think I have been waiting since 1998 for this (this was supposed to be book 3 sometime in the past). After a few years of waiting, I think I managed to ignore it (by ruthlessly ignoring almost all discussion of anything related to these books for years). Other authors take their time: Megan Whalen Turner seems to also take 5-6 years on each new book and that does not impair my love and appreciation for those. Dorothy Dunnett also took her own time planning and writing. My criticisms arenotabout the wait. (I certainly got enough other books to read while waiting). My complaint is that this series seems to have lost focus, became much slower and fragmented. We have many mysteries, prophecies pending from the first 3 books. I want to know who Jon´s parents are (for sure, I mean), or what Varys´s objectives actually are, know how this ends. And we got almost nothing. More hints, more misdirection, a few historical easter eggs for hardcore fans and many many cliffhangers for us to mull till the next book cames out (3 books wait, mininum according to the author). We are not amused.First the good news : I love this series. I love many of the characters. The writing is still awesome, sympathetic, interesting and (usually) subtle. This solves *some* riddles from the previous books and it was nice to see some characters again.But this is not as good asA Storm of Swords. It´s not even as good asA Game of Thrones. Not even close. Maybe that is inherent to the type of tale being told, it was like we were following a small pebble rolling and becoming an avalanche of grief, from AGOT to ASOS. And from then on, if you will forgive the mix of metaphors, the tale went fractal, it split and split, there are new PoV characters and motivations, all is possibilities and confusion. And the momentum seems lost, stalled for us to get to where we know (through foreshadowing and visions) we are going. And it seems like we just can not get there. 1000 pages (ok, about 960, the rest is the very useful character list) and this is it? All of it?There are two particularly annoying issues with this book which damaged my appreciation for the previous books - because those two issues were already present in the rest of the series, and I had dismissed it, excused it. I even used to be a AFFC apologist! One of these issues is the cliffhangers which have been gotten more and more frequent and annoying with each book. I am tired of PoV chapters about nothing in particular, with some flashbacks to the past and then kaboom, chapter ends with some massive revelation (that we are not told of) or even more likely, the character in apparent mortal dangerbecause if any reader thinks Jon is going to die dead-dead before the final book, I got a bridge I want to sell you. Or if I give you my bank account, please deposit some money there in order to receive this massive legacy from a dead dictator. Bitch, please. As if. As if.. This is particularly bad here, there is very little resolution in this book to anybody´s subplot.The other issue which throws my appreciation of the rest of the seriesinto confusion is the female characters.Dear Sansa Stark, dear Catelyn Tully, I get it now, it´s not you, it´s the author. I better put this into: I think GRRM can not write a long, sustained and sympathetic female PoV, when the female is not a woman which fights (or wants to fight) with swords/axes. Not when the woman is conventionally feminine, and particularly not when maternal, romantic or sexual feelings are involved. Oh yeah, GRRM gave Dany a personality transplant. Sansa and Catelyn´s personality, feels like. Besides making Dany stupid and stubborn, over her maternal feelings for the slaves, her romantic feelings are just WTF unbelievable. I am a woman, I get why any woman/girl might fall heads over in heels in lust with a bad-for-you guy, but there is no chemistry at all, nothing compelling there. I am now considering that GRRM might just not *get* how to write romantic interest from a female PoV without turning her into a mat.. Now that I mention thatthe whole Meereen subplot was difficult for me to read about. The omens so strong, the mistakes so obvious, so many of the details I just did not care, since it was so obvious from the start Dany had to be elsewhere. And I am really not sure what some of the new PoVs bring to the story. Barristan, yes, totally. Quentyn Martell, well do we really needed to follow his travels to get there for that to happen? We did not after all follow Barristan on his way to meet Dany.There are more things which bugged me : unlikely conversations between our PoVs and people in powerful positions over them which strike me a bit like plot \"as you know Bob\"s namelyRoose Bolton(!) and Barbrey Dustin reminiscing with Reek about their private past, Jorah Mormont serving as tour guide up to to translating signs for his prisoner Tyrion.Another problem, we now see a lot more of this universe in this book. We are shown much more cleary that Westeros is just a poor backward corner of it. Why then such a focus on Westeros and its wall? And the bigger this universe seems, the more problematic its magical-length multiple years seasons seem to me. And being from the south myself, while I get that real winter is a monstrous thing, a really long, dry, summer can be a horrible thing for lands in the South - there has been no acknowledgement of that so far, no balance, though I still hope for some of that in the rest of the series.I have hope yet there will be a complete rest of the series. But I am stopping recommending it to people now. For years I have been saying, part of the fun is the wait and discussing it with other fans and reading it along with people when it cames out. But after two books which carry the story very little forward, yes, better wait till we are sure the story is completed (and not disappointingly) to wait to read it."

Varamyr was an excellent and intriguing choice. but is he really dead or is he genuinely a part of that warg? and, as always, the writing itself is top notch.* i was one of the few who loved A Feast for Crows, but still... what a happy relief to know i wil be reading my favorite POVs (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Daenerys). although i will miss Arya and Brienne and Jaime. and i still miss Theon. poor, stupid Theon!* uh oh, Tyrion is in mopey, self-loathing, obsessed-with-the-past mode. well, i guess it makes sense, he did just kill his father while finding out terrible things about the loves of his life.* at long last, the death of despicable Janos Slynt. and in such a perfect way. maybe i'm bloodthirsty, but i had to read that part a couple times. ah the satisfaction.* creepy & fascinating Three-Eyed Crow tree-man. hmmm, who is he?* the return of my favorite pathetic anti-hero: Theon! much transformed. i suppose if anyone deserves some torture, it's Theon. hopefully he will learn some lessons and not get killed off in this book. i want the old Theon back, at least a glimpse of him. i need some good chuckles.* so let me get Ramsay Snow's history straight: a bastard of creepy Roose Bolton... he becomes friends with the necrophiliac Reek and together they indulged in much rape & torture... after a typical bout of rape, murder, and necrophilia, the dynamic duo are set upon; Ramsay & Reek switch clothes, and then Reek is run down & killed, except everyone thinks its Ramsay... the new 'Reek' goes into Theon Turncloak's service, goading him into switching a couple more bodies so it seems Bran & Rickon are dead... only to betray Theon with his typical evil evilness, take Winterfell, and bring home Theon as prisoner... much torture ensues for Theon, who Ramsay now dubs the new 'Reek'... Ramsay brings Theon-Reek everywhere, and is about to get hitched to some pretend-Arya so that he becomes the new Lord of Winterfell. okay, got it. what a horrible villain! i just wish he was a bit less two-dimensional. despite the fascintingly depraved history, Ramsay's father Roose is actually far more compelling and threatening a villain.* Xaro Xhoan Daxos returns, and is just as amusingly passive & fey, yet sinister. a queer sort of character. har-dee-har-har!* that sequence with Tyrion on the Shy Maid in the waters around the ruins of Chroyane, fighting off the stone men: a beautifully written and exceedingly eerie chapter. my favorite part so far.* the return of Asha, yahoo! another favorite supporting character. such admirable pluck, such tenacity, such wrong-headedness. must run in the family. and she gets her own over-the-top graphic sex scene. of course she does. Martin loves to give the Greyjoys a dirty, degrading good time when they go at it. huh* a very satisfying sequence between Davos & Wyman Manderly. it is good to see more reverberations from the Red Wedding. kill those Freys, kill 'em all! and a fascinating task for the dull but stalwart Davos. where are these cannibals? Skagos? who knows. and what is Rikon & Shaggydog & Osha doing there in the first place? i bet they fit right in. best of all... the return of Squire Wex! i don't know why i have such attachment to minor characters like the squires Wex & Podrick Payne, but i have found them to be incredibly endearing. little survivors. will Pod be back or has Stoneheart really blown her last gasket and killed a defenseless kid? i guess i won't find that out until the next book.* Melisandre gets her on POV chapter. quite a surprise. just as i've always thought, she is not a villain. she's just trying to save the world! it was interesting to get some insight on her red magic. even more interesting was to see a softer & more human side, trying to help Davos not lose another son and doing her best to gain Jon Snow's trust. but the best thing about this chapter was finding out that not only did Mance not die a craven - he didn't die at all. i had thought that that was a pretty cheap way to kill off a major supporting character, but now it appears that the supporting character that was killed off was cheap minor-league villain Rattleshirt instead. good riddance!* Daenerys' chapters are getting a little tiresome. they are well-written, of course, and rather moving. but enough already. time to get down to business and time to stop gushing whenever Daario comes to mind.* the first (and only?) set-piece of the novel thankfully belongs to Daenerys: the rather incredible chapter on the post-wedding pit fights. so many things happening at once, such great use of subtle details and hints and little character bits. and then ending with the awesome flight of Drogon & Daenerys. wonderful. somewhat makes up for all the tiresome Meereen business.* ASOIF has a good assortment of Men in the Autumn of Their Years type voices, nearly all of them fierce, honest, proud, and fair. unfortunately, they are often not that exciting. i think my favorite may be the most recent addition, Barristan Selmy. not only is he a kindly bad-ass, we get to read a lot about the pre-AGOT history of Westeros. it is all so fascinating. i would love to read a POV from poor dead Rhaegar. i would love a whole novel featuring Arthur Dayne, Sword of the Morning.* the sad & terrible end of young Quentyn Martell. poor lad. what a tragic misadventure his life turned out to be. he seemed to have inherited his father's innate integrity and dislike of needless death & violence, but none of his wily intelligence.* an exccellent epilogue. the final chapters in ASOIF always seem to feature important characters reappearing or transformed orfound alive. Daenerys at the end of AGOT, unscathed from flames and cradling her newborn dragons. Bran emerging alive from the vaults at the end of ACOK. Catelyn returning as the undead Stoneheart at the end of ASOS. Jaqen H'ghar transformed into Pate the Pigboy at the end of AFFC. and now Varys returning from who knows where at the end of this novel. good news! glad to see at least a glimpse of one of my favorite characters. we get to meet some of his little birds too. and two more major players to add to the ASOIF Death List, thanks Varys!_________________________An Astro-Freudian AnalysisMORE SPOILERS AHEADboth the practice of Astrology and Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche are, in this modern world, often dismissed as existing in a fantastical version of reality. although there is an obvious gulf between the two... what of it? let us combine them into an exciting new form of analysis in order to evaluate the various characters that have sprung from the mind of George R.R. Martin, as seen within the pages of his fantasy A Dance with Dragons.born on September 20th, Martin falls under the Sun Sign Virgo.THE IDVirgo is often associated with \"the Virgin\" and as such is commonly mistaken as a sign of repressed sexuality and enforced innocence. but it is the opposite that is true: Virgo is an earth sign and is therefore actually associated with sensuality and fertility. Virgo is a sexual sign. however, Virgo is also a discriminating sign and so will often find vulgarity and selfish physicality to be negative and worthy of critique and improvement; the unrepressed pleasure principle of the Id is an aspect of the personality that must not be allowed to take precedence.Martin places his Id within his POV characters Theon and Asha Greyjoy. he alllows them unbridled ambition, overweening pride, strong physicality, and a fondness for quick violence. he gives them the nastiest of sex scenes - ones that are striking in their pornographic detail, their often uncouth language, their tendency to revel in degrading and aggressive/submissive behavior. and then he punishes them for it. in A Feast for Crows, Asha spends all of that book attempting to assert dominance over her people, to rule them; she fails and is publicly humiliated. in Dance, her appearance is more brief: she engages in an exceedingly explicit consensual faux-rape scene with her lover Qarl the Maid; immediately afterwards, her castle is captured and she is put into chains by that most repressive of characters, Stannis Baratheon. in both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, Theon's id is equally on display, as he boasts, brags, encourages warfare, invades his former home Winterfell, has various bouts of degrading sex with various women whom he then discards, and finally allows the death of two innocent children. Martin the Virgo does not allow him to remain unchastised: by the time Dance with Dragons occurs, Theon has been tortured beyond belief, broken, and turned into a sad, empty shell of a man. the Greyjoy Id is thus thoroughly chastened by the discriminating Virgo author.THE SUPEREGOa traditional Virgoan trait is to form a strong attachment to the ideal of altruism; Virgos frequently live to serve \"the greater good\". and so Virgo is often at ease within the Superego, the place of the conscience. this is not an entirely positive thing; Virgoan comfort with expressing and enacting their ideals may often make others uncomfortable. Virgos who do not restrain their tendencies towards constant altruism will often, at best,rub people the wrong wayand, at worst, be easily taken advantage of by those that they hold in high regard or be held hostage to their own belief system.Martin has placed his Superego in many characters. and, surprisingly, he has then often destroyed them. Eddard Stark operated entirely from his conscience, by following his own higher ideals... and that led him to his death. Catelyn Stark followed her own misguided Superego and her throat is cut (only to be resurrected as pure Id, in the form of Lady Stoneheart). who knows what fate is in store for Barristan Selmy. the Superego is also what guides Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow. Davos' higher ideal is clearly his unwavering service to King Stannis. he will bravely follow his lord's every command, no matter the danger, no matter the cost - whether it be his freedom or even the lives of his sons (indeed, after the deaths of his four elder children, he continues to entrust another child to Stannis). Jon Snow follows his own array of Superego ideals: the code of the Black Brother, the rebuilding of the Wall's defenses at any cost, and the Saving of Wildling Lives - no matter the feelings and prejudices expressed by his fellows. in the end, his good works earn him knives in the dark. will he survive? well duh, of course he will.THE EGOthe fully actualized Virgo must balance the competing goals of their Id and Superego. they must be careful not to over-indulge in the pleasures of the flesh, the joys of vengeance, even the self-absorption of the romantic heart. they must also reign in their tendency to parade both their intelligence and their overtly altruistic nature in front of others as a sort of badge of honor. a positive Virgo keeps their shit in order. the well-balanced Virgo (indeed, the well-balanced human in general) will act simultaneously from the heart, the head, and the groin... but the reality principle that is the Ego can be difficult to maintain. Martin centers this constant balancing act within his characters Daenerys and Tyrion.in A Game of Thrones, Daenerys spent most of her time attempting to balance her twin desires for Power and Love; at this early stage, her Id appeared to be strongly present, yet was often thwarted by her sensible Ego-driven nature. by the time of A Storm of Swords, her nascent Superego had risen, eventually coming to its zenith during her burning destruction of the slave trade in Astapor & Meereen. but in A Dance with Dragons, Daenerys has become the Ego personified: on the one hand, remaining in a city of horrors to follow the higher call of improving the lot of her people; on the other, indulging in her Id-driven need for a romantic/sexual relationship with the clownish Daario Naharis... both tendencies existing in careful balance.Tyrion has had a similar engagement with his balancing reality principle - often indulging in the lusts and vengeance of the Id, yet seldom straying far from his Superego's need todo the right thing, whether it be his support of Jon Snow, the design of a riding saddle for Bran, his intent to do right for his newly acquired allies, cleaning up and preparing King's Landing for war, or even saving Aegon Targaryen from the stonemen at the potential cost of his own life. it is this integration of both tendencies within one body - this constant balancing - that makes Tyrion one of the more real characters in the series. perhaps in some ways he is Martin's stand-in. he certainly has a host of classic Virgoan tendencies: overtly critical, analytical, calculating, and possessed of a dangerously sharp tongue. as a Virgo myself, i personally demonstrate these myriad - and wondrous, oh so wondrous! - traits on a regular basis, and of course, on command._________________________A Summary of Sortsoverall, i loved the book, a typically awesome entry in the series. it is also a flawed book: overlong, filled with far too many names, ordeals that seem to go on and on. andNOTE TO MARTIN'S EDITOR: HE NEEDS TO STOP BEING SO GODDAMN REPETITIOUS WITH SOME OF HIS KEY PHRASES. FUCKIN' A, ENOUGH ALREADY!although it has a much wider canvas and a diverse range of perspectives, it was somehow less distinctive than the female-driven, almost crushingly bleak A Feast for Crows. and it features only one genuine set piece (although an amazing one): Daenerys' flight from Meereen on Drogon.but i still loved it, from beginning to end. i loved the returning POVs that i missed so much from the prior volume, and i also really enjoyed the new POVs. the Theon/Reek chapters were morbidly compelling. i always appreciate Davos' chapters (too few of them, alas) and i particularly liked his two meetings with Wyman Manderly. as Kelly says in her excellentreview, much of Daenerys' (and Jon Snow's) chapters were all about the complex business of actual government, of the challenges in balancing competing needs... an admirable goal for a fantasy novel. and as Ryan mentions in his ownreview, Martin continues his fascinating study of Identity, of the roles and often guises that men and women are forced into - a theme that reverberates throughout nearly all of this series' major perspectives and so many supporting characters: Eddard, Sansa, Jon Snow, Maester Aemon, Bran &Brynden Rivers the Bloodraventhe Three-Eyed Crow, Catelyn/Stoneheart, Arya & the Faceless Men, Theon/Reek, Barristan/Whitebeard, Tyrion and his two names, the fake Hound, the hidden Aegon, the disguised Quentyn, Varys, Jeyne Poole/fake Arya, Mance Rayder, not-a-princess Val & the switched babies, etc, etc.so yeah, despite its issues, overall i loved A Dance with Dragons, from intriguing Prologue to completely satisfying Epilogue._________________________An Unsettling Character_________________________A Major Player (and Semi Major Player) DEATH LIST* Benjen Stark aka Coldhands (in transit)Death by Other, perhaps* Viserys Targaryen ✔Death by Khal Drogo's Molten Gold* Robert Baratheon ✔Death by Lannister Encouragement in engaging in Drunken Boaring* Eddard Stark ✔Death by Joffrey's Order & Ilyn's Axe* Khal Drogo ✔Death by Mirri's Poison & Daenerys' Pillow* Renly Baratheon ✔Death by Melisandre's Shadowspawn* Jeor Mormont ✔Death by Black Brother Treachery* Robb Stark ✔Death by Frey & Bolton Treachery* Catelyn Stark aka Lady Stoneheart (in transit)Death by Frey & Bolton Treachery* Balon Greyjoy ✔Death by Bridge Misadventure (at the direction of Euron Croweye?)* Joffrey Baratheon ✔Death by Olenna Redwyne's Poison & Littlefinger's Evil Littlemind* Oberyn Martell ✔Death by Gregor Clegane's Sword & Hands* Shae ✔Death by Tyrion's Hands* Tywin Lannister ✔Death by Tyrion's Crossbow* Lysa Arryn ✔Death by Littlefinger's Push* Beric Dondarrion ✔Death, Sweet Death...

So there has not been another book published by Martin since the show started (the sixth planned publication will not be published in 2018, word on the street is MAYBE 2020 – when Martin will be 72).Full disclosure – I've only just started watching to series and am picking up what they are throwing down.Anyway.This is another wonderful visit with George and his masterful creation. The meandering plotlines and varying POV chapters keep this moving as well as the previous novels and his world building keeps getting better. His further expansion in the story to include more Essos chapters and a more detailed approach to those sub-plots were compelling and thoroughly entertaining. The return of Daenerys, Jon Snow and Tyrion (conspicuously absent from 2005'sA Feast for Crows) adds to this latest outing as well.All that to say that THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!So I'm caught up and I now stand in line with millions of other readers worldwide and will lend my voice to the growing cacophony:\"HEY GEORGE, WHILE WE'RE YOUNG! (and while you're still alive)\""

Not every time, is it?In fact whenever I reread a Dance with Dragons, I get lost at the very same place, my most treasured book parts are the self same. I don't read the book to hone any detective skill that might be lying dormant in me, but for pure pleasure.I know the book has problems, but I say that it wouldn't do to follow the same schema as previous books. A Dance with Dragons is officially the fourth best book I've ever read. I can't find the right words to express that hyperbole ( to others). But you know who you are. You who have favorite books and reread them every year. We share the same hobby!"

        "user_review": "Entre más extenso sea un libro o una saga, más probabilidad existe de que el inconformismo aumente. Buen libro, pero no en todo momento.Si tuviera que explicar cómo ha sido mi experiencia con esta saga mencionaría que ha sido satisfactoria. Sin embargo, si tuviera que explicar cómo ha sido mi experiencia con este volumen mencionaría que ha sido bastante conflictiva. La saga me ha encantado, disfruté cada volumen, cada muerte, cada giro inesperado, cada traición y cada cambio de poder en el trono, pero cuando una serie es muy larga tarde que temprano llegará el momento en que nos aburrirá. No aplica en todos los casos, pero aquí sí. El exceso de información, de linajes, de historias, de descripciones, ese intento de seguir agrandando el universo creado por Martin no es una buena elección, y más, cuando siguen existiendo tantas incógnitas con referencias a personajes desaparecidos... más cuando la edad del autor no nos da garantías de que la serie finalice en algún momento... Como lectores agradecemos que nuestras lecturas tengan un final, de hecho es muy importante que exista un final, pero acá, queridos interesados en George Martin, eso jamás lo encontrarán.Tal y como mencioné en la pre-reseña han sido más de 5000 páginas leídas las cuales no me arrepiento de leer, a pesar de que ha sido uno de los viajes literarios más prolongados que he tenido en mi vida. Un viaje que de todos modos aún no termina porque todavía me falta leer algunos libros adicionales como Fuego y sangre, o El mundo de hielo y fuego; eso sin contar los doce o trece capítulos adicionales que aparecen en internet que pertenecerían al hipotético sexto libro. Este viaje que a simple vista parece infinito me ha dejado muy buenos recuerdos grabados en mi mente, un sinfín de horas de entretenimiento, y un torrente de emociones derramadas en cada una de las escenas que han logrado impactarme. Es este el momento en que quiero agradecer a aquellas personas que me han acompañado en esta travesía y que me han otorgado amablemente sus consejos. Gracias, muchas gracias, en verdad una lectura es más bonita cuando te sientes acompañado en el viaje. Muchas gracias.Sobre este quinto volumen debo reconocer que la experiencia no ha sido totalmente satisfactoria. El inicio fue súper tedioso, casi nada me gustaba, la transformación de identidad de varios de mis personajes favoritos no me agradó para nada (Tyrion y Daenerys), y muchos capítulos los sentí monótonos, lentísimos y fuera de lugar. Ya me habían advertido que algo así me ocurriría pero nunca imaginé que el sentimiento de desagrado fuera a ser tan alto. Fue una sección donde sufrí mucho, maldecía cada rato, no había adrenalina, no había casi nada emocionante. En mi opinión, es el libro de la saga que tiene el peor arranque de todos. Obviamente, no fueron todos los capítulos. Por momento algunas pinceladas de genialidad las noté en ciertos capítulos (Jon Nieve y Hediondo), y resultaron convirtiéndose en el empuje necesario para no abandonar la lectura. Eso sí, solo sería hasta más allá de la mitad del libro donde empezaría a sentir realmente curiosidad por seguir leyendo, antes no.Siendo del todo honesto ha sido una experiencia extraña porque lo que anhelaba leer en este volumen no lo encontré, eso me generó insatisfacción, pero las escenas que más me gustaron fueron completamente inesperadas y me han dejado con mucha curiosidad de seguir leyendo la continuación: Es por ello que me siento confundido al escribir sobre este libro. En el cuarto y quinto libro he sentido que el autor se ha alejado bastante de lo que sus lectores esperan encontrar en sus historias, y en vez de reducir un poco las incógnitas —o por lo menos narrar la continuación de los personajes presentados anteriormente— lo que hace es justamente lo contrario, es decir incrementarlas. Para ser un poco más concreto mencionaré el claro ejemplo del prólogo en el cual se menciona una historia que no vuelve a nombrarse en el resto de libro; no obstante, es un capítulo que nos deja dudas, del cual esperamos información adicional, algo, lo que sea, pero nunca aparece algo así: Es más, ya había olvidado el prólogo, pero solo lo recordé cuando finalicé el libro y revisé nuevamente como iniciaba el libro. Asimismo, la expansión de personajes y linajes es cada vez más excesiva llevando al inevitable aburrimiento de un mundo infinito que el autor no quiere finalizar jamás. Muchos de aquellos personajes ni siquiera son importantes, pero el autor insiste en nombrar a todos los que rodean a los «protagonistas» así la escena tenga la duración de solo una página. Tantos personajes, tanto aplazamiento de lo inevitable, tanta espera me desesperó por momentos y me hizo sentir que estaba leyendo relleno.También siento que le ha faltado al libro más adrenalina y mejores participantes en este juego de tronos. Muchos de los personajes importantes tienen poder, eso es genial, pero no lo saben utilizar por lo que descubrir las falencias en sus estrategias es un poco desilusionante. Teniendo en cuenta que como lectores venimos de conocer las artimañas de ciertos personajes que son unos genios para el arte de la guerra, entonces no es fácil soportar a malos jugadores del juego de tronos. Es como si acabáramos de ver las competencias de los Juegos Olímpicos y luego nos dedicáramos a observar alguna competencia deportiva a nivel regional; como acabamos de ver a los mejores atletas del mundo obviamente será poco probable que nos emocionemos con estas jóvenes promesas que aún necesitan de más entrenamiento: Eso fue lo que me sucedió con Danza de Dragones. La reorganización de los diferentes entes del poder, la preparación de futuras guerras, la repartición de tierras, títulos, etc., todo eso es genial, pero ese cambio y esa inexperiencia de los futuros gobernantes le resulta costando al libro mucha adrenalina; aspecto que había sido protagonista en todos los volúmenes anteriores.A pesar de todo me ha gustado, no puedo negarlo, solo que en mi opinión es excesivamente largo. Creo que el autor pudo haber omitido muchos capítulos pero la decisión del autor fue crear su libro así, por lo que debemos respetar y tolerar su elección. Me siento con la misma cantidad de incógnitas y preguntas que cuando finalicé Juego de Tronos; me siento realizado por lograr una meta que exige tanto tiempo y disciplina como leer esta saga; me siento contento de finalmente conocer el argumento de una de las sagas de fantasía más valoradas de la literatura; me siento triste porque mi percepción me indica que nunca conoceré el final de esta historia; me siento impresionado por la gran capacidad de GRRM para crear un mundo tan abismal como el de Poniente; me siento satisfecho porque esta saga ha sido una muy buena compañía para mi vida.Sobre esta saga hay mucho que contar, sinfín de detalles para analizar y cotillear, pero siento que con lo que he escrito es suficiente. ¿Un buen libro? Sí. ¿El mejor? Claramente no. ¿Lo repetiría? Por supuesto que no, muchas páginas tienen relleno. ¿Recomiendo la saga? Claro que sí, no obstante después del tercer volumen la probabilidad de que aumenten las quejas y molestias es alta. ¿Lo mejor? Los constantes cambios de poder, traiciones, planes, asesinatos y demás. ¿Lo peor? Que la historia es interminable. Cada quien toma la decisión de leer lo que acapara su atención, sin embargo, Canción de Hielo y Fuego es un paso cuasi obligatorio para todo amante de la fantasía. La calificación podría ser de cuatro estrellas pero por la primera mitad del libro no puedo hacerlo, tres estrellas me parece una puntuación justa."

        "user_review": "Well, I guess we know now why Martin took so long to release this latest volume: it's a steaming mess.Forget for a moment the fact that of the many principal POV characters, only one (Jon Snow) has any discernible character arc throughout the tome's 940+ pages. Forget too that the only female POV characters (Cersei and Dany, and even Asha in her first chapter) can scarcely go two pages without pining lustily and pathetically for their male paramours. Don't trouble yourself with the chapters (Victarion, Davos) that could have been told more effectively in three sentence flashbacks in the next installment. And sure, one storyline features a character to whom we have never been introduced (Quentyn), forced to spend dozens of pages on, only to have that character fail to be an interesting character or a consequence to the larger narrative. So what?The larger issue is this: Martin has created a wondrous, fully-realized world in which many people (including myself) are happy to spend a great deal of time. He's just forgotten that he's supposed to be advancing a story within that world. Instead he spins his wheels. Nearly all the action takes place in a far-flung city operating within an alien (and uninteresting) civilization with a unique set of moral norms, with no apparent consequences for the people with whom we've already spent four books and 4000 pages with. Some characters don't advance at all from the beginning of this book's action; worse, some characters end up back where they began several books before.It's as if J.K. Rowling decided to create a book between 4 and 5, with the great bulk of time devoted to Hermione's wanderings in Dobby's homeland instead of Hogwarts. What a misfire."

        "user_review": "\"In our sleep, pain, which cannot forget, fallsdrop by drop upon the heart until, in our owndespair, against our will, come wisdomthrough the awful grace of God.--AeschylusI get a wild hair every so often and recently I decided that I needed to go on a 1970s blockbuster horror novel extravaganza tour. It all started with shifted some books around and finding thisrattywell loved copy ofThe Exorcistthat inexplicably found its way into my book collection. I'd swear it was stolen from one ofKemper's now famous Rubbermaid container boxes of nostalgic paperbacks, but I gave my midget ninjas specific instructions NOT to take anything from Kemper's abode, but simply take a look around, so the presence of this book on my shelves is still a mystery.The Mysterious copy of The Exorcist.When I was in middle school I rode the bus to school and every day this teenager with rumpled hair and scuffed motorcycle boots would catch a ride with us. He had been clocked for speeding by the cops and had led them on a merry chase around the countryside until he turned a corner too quickly, hit gravel, and rolled his car. He was aLEGEND. Needless to say he lost his driving privileges for a long, long time. He would always sit in the front and there was always this sweet scent coming off his clothes that later when I went to college and attended my first party I had that ah ha moment. He'd lean back against the window and hoist those boots out in the aisle where we could all admire them. He always had a paperback novel with him, usually of the horror genre, and he would studiously ignore us and read his book. We of course were boring holes through him with fevered eyes because he was the most fascinating thing we'd ever seen.One day he looked back down the bus at us and said, \"You want me to read you some of this?\" as he flopped the latest paperback in the air. It was calledThe Exorcist. I don't know if he understood or even understands today how cool a gesture that was, but it was pretty damn cool. So he started reading to us. We never got the whole story just bits here and there. Sometimes he would disappear for a while usually because he was jammed up in a little more trouble than normal. He'd show up with different paperbacks,The Omen,Psycho,Rosemary's Baby,The Other, andThe Amityville Horrorto name a few.We were enraptured.He scared the crap out of us.The ghastly images those books inspired in my mind kept my eyes wide open late into the late which might have something to do with why my mom wouldn't let me read such books.Those moments on the bus with him reading to us and scaring us are some of my most fond childhood memories. Boy, did we feel like we were getting away with something.So I started reading my ratty, not Kemper's copy, ofThe Exorcistand could not believe how much I was struggling with the writing. The dialogue was horrible. How could this guy sell millions of copies of this book? I did some research. It seems that William Peter Blatty finished writing the rough draft of this book and was offered a lucrative screenwriting job and never polished the book. An editor, obviously not someone in the same category as Maxwell Perkins, allowed the book to go to print as basically a rough draft. Decades later Blatty is asked to read the book for the audio version. He kept having to stop to ask \"who wrote this crap?\" This story does have a happy ending. Blatty went back through and polished and rewrote and even added a critical scene to the book. It was released in time for the fortieth anniversary edition.William Peter Blatty looking like he is ready for his casting call for a spaghetti western.The Dodge City Public library, they never has anything I absolutely need immediately, had a copy of the fortieth anniversary edition. Hallelujah! Praise the book gods!The difference between the books is a two star rating which I was already worried about how I was going to explain that rating to the legions of fans out there, and a four star rating which is much easier and much more fun to write a review for. So if you have thoughts of reading this book make sure you read the fortieth anniversary edition because as Blatty stated.\"This is the version I would like to be remembered for.\"This is a novel about a demon possession of a twelve year old girl, but Blatty also spends a good amount of time explaining the other psychological aspects that could be causing the symptoms other than a demonic possession. The priest Damien Karras, who also happens to be a psychologist, finds himself confronting not only an evil entity beyond his wildest imaginations, but also his personal struggles with his own faith. He is damaged, dark, and brooding...a magnet for women if he were interested.Jason Miller is Damien Karras in the movie.\"As he lifted the Host in consecration, it trembled in his fingers with a hope that he dared not hope, that he fought with every particle and fiber of his will. \"'For this--is--My body.'\" he intoned with a whispered intensity.No, it's bread! It's nothing but bread!He dared not love again and lose. That loss was too great, that pain too keen. The cause of his skepticism and his doubts, his attempts to eliminate natural causes in the case of Regan's seeming possession, was the fiery intensity of his yearning to be able to believe. He bowed his head and placed the consecrated Host in his mouth, where in a moment it would stick in the dryness of his throat. And of his faith.\"The thought that kept going through my head as I read this book is if you find proof of the devil or a demon or even true evil doesn't that mean you��ve found proof of God?Glory be to God for dappled things,For skies of couple-color as a brindled cow;For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;Fresh-fire-coal chestnut falls; finches' wings...He fathers forth whose beauty is past change.Praise him.Regan or Rags as her mother likes to call her starts exhibiting strange behavior, talking in tongues, and levitating. It is never really explained how or why she becomes possessed. Unless I somehow missed that part. Changing editions midstream has me a little worried about that as I did not go back and read the hundred or so pages that I'd read before the switch. She goes from being a creative, likable, normal twelve year old girl into something that is not only horrifying, but barely recognizable as human.Linda Blair played Regan in the famous movie version.\"Reining in his revulsion, he closed the door and then his eyes locked, stunned, on the thing that was Regan, on the creature that was lying on its back on the bed, head propped against a pillow while eyes bulged wide in their hollow sockets shone with mad cunning and burning intelligence, with interest and with spite, as they fixed upon his; as they watched him intently, seething in a face shaped into a skeletal mask of unthinkable malevolence. Karras shifted his gaze to the tangled and thickly matted hair; to the wasted arms and legs and distended stomach jutting up so grotesquely; then back to the eyes: they were watching him...pinning him...\"Transformed!!!Terrifying stuff!\"Requested and performed exorcisms had begun to decline in the Western world by the 18th century due to advancements in medical understanding, and occurred rarely until the latter half of the 20th century when the public saw a sharp rise due to the media attention exorcisms were getting. There was \"a 50% increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s\".Media suggested hysteria.Iconic shot from the movie.The church has a priest who had performed the last exorcism in 1949. He is an elderly Jesuit priest named Lankester Merrin. The two priests know they are over their heads, but in a true act of courage and faith take on the demon. No need for more details as I'm sure most of you have seen the movie and if you have not I would encourage you to read the book before watching the movie. The movie was nominated for ten academy awards and grossed over $441 million worldwide. No wonder the demand for priests and their knowledge of exorcisms went up exponentially. The tour of 1970s horror will continue withJaws. Stay tuned.ADDENDUMMy friend,Gary Wyatt, supplied me with a picture of the house where the famous exorcism case happened in 1949. This was the case that inspired William Peter Blatty to write this book. Instead of a girl this case involved a thirteen year old boy named Roland Doe. Walter Halloran a Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus performed the exorcism.

        "user_review": "Who doesn´t know those nasty, itchy childhood diseases that can cause potential long-term complications when one gets them as an adult such as chickenpox, scarlet fever, demonic obsessive compulsive disorder, ...It´s a well-written novel, but what interests me more is the development of the horror genre, how it changed over time, and especially what has meanwhile become possible.The book was revolutionary for its time, cause it deals with religion, vulgarly talking young women, and some horror elements. May have been shocking and controversial for its time when the Philistines were still a strong force, but nowadays it seems benign, nearly cute, compared to computer games dealing with war crimes and genres like extreme horror that go to the, haha extreme.I just heard about that, it´s not as if I would be reading such sick genres or even have an own shelf dedicated to it or something. But if, let´s say, in a parallel universe, I would be reading such nasty things, I would argue with the fact that I don´t watch (horror) movies anymore and simply need a surrogate. Yea, that sounds logical and credible and absolutely not hypocritical...That there are less and less taboo topics is great for the openness of society, but bad for authors who need more and fresh ideas to still shock the audience that is already pretty apathetic and badass.In general, authors who follow a new path in the form of previously unprecedented ideas, instead of copying and modifying the mantra of better good copying than horribly self-made, should be praised for their creativity. However, if a subgenre is launched with such an impact that, in a certain way, up to the xth paranormal activity cucumber today, there is an almost imperceptible echo, the artist has ennobled himself by creating something fully justified called \"cult\".The story of the actress' daughter, who is gradually becoming more and more special in her behavior, shines with facts from occultism, psychology, neurology, and religion that have been meticulously researched, which helps to create an entertaining reading experience and increases the horror significantly through this apparent reference to reality.One of the most remarkable features of the book is the disassembly of stereotypes in the form of a science and reason-oriented priest and the contrast of an actress who is uninterested in any rational approach and tends to literally \"paint the devil on the wall\". The difference between and the path to the respective perspectives of the two make up an essential part of the narrative structure and, in parallel to the ever-worsening obsession-related symptoms of the not just mental disease, the explanatory or repression patterns also increase to unimagined heights and complexities.How to play on the keyboard of the nerve-wracking arc without striking violence and with a virtuoso, slow increase of suspense, while contradicting explanatory approaches collide and effectively resolve everything in a finally redeeming culmination, deserves a paranoid look over your shoulder when you stay alone in the dark at home after finishing this outstanding novel.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "\"Perhaps evil is the crucible of goodness. And perhaps even Satan - Satan, in spite of himself, somehow serves to work out the will of God.\"The Exorcist tells the story of Chris MacNeil, a successful actress at the height of her career. Chris is beautiful, rich, famous, and about to transition from leading lady to film director. She lives with her twelve year old daughter Regan in a rented accommodation. Regan begins to display strange and unusual behavior. Gradually, the peculiar turns to the bizarre, and within a brief span of time, Regan is displaying all the signs of demonic possession.The Exorcist is without a doubt, one of the best horror novels ever written. The story is incredibly complex, and the representation of it's characters as flawed human beings, each with their own doubts, guilt and struggles makes the character work in this novel superb. The novel is also as graphic as it is complex. An early scene in the book describes the desecration of a church that is certainly not for the squeamish. The Exorcist has a plethora of scenes that range from creepy to bone chilling to outright shocking! Spin a wheel and pick your favourite!\"Gliding spiderlike, rapidly, close behind Sharon, her body arched backward in a bow with her head almost touching her feet, was Regan, her tongue flicking quickly in and out of her mouth while she sibilantly hissed and moved her head very slightly back and forth like a serpent. Sharon stopped then screamed as she felt Regan's tongue sneaking out at her ankle. That day, everywhere Sharon went, Regan followed...\"\"Do you know what she did? Your c*nting daughter?\"The connection that the author creates between the reader and Father Karas while he is questioning his God and the involvement it has with Regan and her situation was so beautifully done. He created one of the most believable and tragic characters and this was my favourite part of the novel. The relationship between Chris and Regan is also very key. Chris loves Regan and cares for her deeply but it almost starts to feel like the character of Regan doesn't exist anymore. One of my favourite quotes is when Merrin says to Karras that the demons deeds are not aimed purely at Regan, but in fact at the others in the house.\"The demon's target is not the possessed; it is us the observers.. everyone in this house. I think the point is to make us despair..to reject our humanity: to see ourselves as ultimately bestial, vile and putrescent; without dignity; ugly; unworthy.\"This is a breathtaking novel, certainly not for the easily scared or faint of heart and no novel or movie/tv work has come close to the sheer terror, creepiness and gripping nature of this tremendous story. While I love the film adaptation and have watched it more times than I care to mention, the book has an intense depth and details that the film only hinted at.William Peter Blatty deserves, just for this book alone to be recognised as an important and prolific author.My Highest Recommendation.\"You don't blame us for being here, do you? After all, we have no place to go. No home... Incidentally, what an excellent day for an exorcism...\""

        "user_review": "\"The Exorcist\" by William Peter Blatty is a novel that I know being a horror enthusiast is one that should be read. You know, one of those \"must-read\" novels that have to be experienced at least once in your life to truly appreciate such an iconic and impactful part of horror history. Now, before I begin my review of this novel, I'd like to share a quick little story about me that happened back in 1992 when I was just 11 years old over Halloween weekend.It was late that Halloween night that I, a silly little boy trying to get scared, decided to watch \"The Exorcist\" movie. I'm talking about the original movie, uncensored, and in its entirety. Needless to say, that movie traumatized the hell out of me. I specifically remember not being able to sleep that night and literally had a rosary on me at all times around my neck for months.This movie traumatized me so much that I could NEVER hear that famous song \"Tubular Bells\" from this horror movie in any way, shape, or form. I couldn't even see Linda Blair's face without turning away because that movie was burned into my soul for decades.It wasn't until I was an adult that I was able to get through all this trauma thanks to the death metal band Possessed. They have a legendary metal song called \"The Exorcist\" which helped me overcome my fear of this movie, Regan, and everything associated with this franchise. It was on their epic album \"Seven Churches\" that features the actual theme song from the movie that did it. At first, it terrified me but since it's death metal, it eventually healed me. I love metal and needless to say, it helped me get through many difficult parts of my life including the trauma of \"The Exorcist\" and well, now it was time to put this novel down once and for all.Before I jump into my review, \"The Exorcist\" does have a few trigger warnings that I found while reading…- Violence against babies (Satanic Black Masses)- Satanism- Major religious defamation against CatholicismIf any of these trigger warnings bother you, please do not read this novel. Moving along, this is the first time I've ever read anything by Blatty and I have to say, he has excellent writing skills. I was blown away at how exceptionally talented he is as an author and I was instantly hooked right from the start.The added graphics at the start of each part of this novel was also a nice touch. I love it when novels have that as it brings me back to my teenage years seeing them in the various horror paperbacks I used to love reading. It just added another creepy layer of horror to this novel and not for nothing, this was a genuine pageturner. Not a single boring part or anything that dragged on, it was fantastic.There are so many creepy parts here that brought me back to my 11-year-old self, it's crazy. I knew I buried all this away deep inside me decades ago but to read it now as an adult who loves reading horror felt pretty damn good. I knew this day would come since it was inevitable due to my love of all things horror.Make no mistake about it, \"The Exorcist\" is a horror masterpiece. This novel is so creepy, disturbing, disgusting, and horrific that I would say this should be a required read for anyone who loves horror and can actually handle it. Seriously, this novel will freak you out. I guarantee it.All the characters here were great and of course, Regan led the way as every single encounter with her was beyond frightening. Again, flashbacks hit me, that voice hit me, just the atmospheric writing here by Blatty has left an imprint on me that, just like the movie, will never leave me. Ever.This novel is so damn scary, it literally sent chills down my spine several times while reading. All the tension, suspense, and horror are top-notch and some of the best I've ever read in my life. I haven't felt this way since I first read \"IT\" by Stephen King as a teenager. You know that kind of horror that you read, blows you away, and genuinely freaks you the hell out? Yeah, this did it just as effectively if not even more since it deals with demonic possession to make it extra horrific.I made so many weird faces reading this that my head was spinning. My eyes got so large at certain parts because they were that intense. The backstory of all sorts of demonic history, possession interviews, Black Masses, and Satanism were all great to fill in just how crazy these exorcisms truly are. All of this led to one climactic ending that was incredible and bone-chillingly good. As they say, the novel is better than the movie but in my case, they both are impactful no matter which way you slice it.Now, to share one last quick story before I reveal my final Star Rating, you will not believe what happened to me the first night I started reading this novel. I give you my word that this is completely true and something that legit freaked me out. I promise you that this isn't made up or anything.It was a little after 3 AM on Saturday, October 28, 2023. I was about 8% into \"The Exorcist\" and as I read on my Kindle Paperwhite, I like to take notes so when I write my book reviews, I don't forget anything. I stopped reading and went to type in \"genuine page-turner\" and my Kindle automatically started flipping pages like crazy. I'm talking nonstop page-turning and it ended up at 24% before I had to close my Kindle to stop it because pressing the main button didn't work. I have been reading on a Kindle for at least 10+ years now and that has never, ever happened to me. Not a single time. I have goosebumps just typing this out as I'm not sure what to think at this point in my life. Saw this movie as a kid and decided to read the novel 31 years later to make it full circle and then this happens.I give \"The Exorcist\" by William Peter Blatty a 5/5 and will highly recommend this horror novel until the end of time. I would even say it should be required reading if you love horror as much as I do because this is indeed the scariest novel ever written. It's the scariest novel I've ever read in my life and it's one of those reading experiences that will stay with you forever. It's incredible, atmospheric, horrific, disturbing, perverse, and just checks every single box towards being a horror novel masterpiece. This is perfection and it's only fitting I saw this movie on Halloween night back in 1992 and finished the novel on Halloween night in 2023. The freakiest part? That's 31 years later and my birthday is December 31st. As I said, it's all full circle for me and I will never forget the impact \"The Exorcist\" has had on my life. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go buy a new Kindle."

        "user_review": "UPDATE: $1.99 Kindle US today 10/26/20I think I'm ready. . . Help!Well, maybe I'm weird but I found the movie scarier than the book. Don't get me wrong, there are a few parts that gave me the heebie jeebies, but overall it didn't get me like the movie. Just getting the gifs for this freaking review had me all creeped out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book is very disturbing though. Reading the stuff about people in the Black Mass and what they were doing. Uggg, no.I thought about getting a copy of the movie to watch again since I have read the book but hell no. Just NO! The only reason I wanted to watch it again is because I wanted to see if they had some of the really disturbing things in the movie that were in the book. I wanted to see if they talked about all of the Black Mass stuff and different things that were in-depth in the book because I can't remember any of that stuff it was so long ago.I remember when I was younger I had a nightmare that she was coming after me on a bicycle! Lol, and it was scary as hell and seemed real. A bicycle though, heh!There is a part in the prologue that I didn't even realize was in another part of the movie until I read the book. It was about the demon when Father Merrin was overseas.The man in khaki prowled the ruins. The Temple of Nabu. The Temple of Ishtar. He sifted vibrations. At the palace of Ashurbanipal he stopped and looked up at the limestone statue hulking in situ. Ragged wings and taloned feet. A bulbous, jutting, stubby penis and a mouth stretched taunt in feral grin. The demon Pazuzu.Abruptly the man in khaki sagged.He bowed his head.It was coming.He stared at the dust and the quickening shadows. The orb of the sun was beginning to slip beneath the rim of the world and he could hear the dim yappings of savage dog packs prowling the fringes of the city. He rolled his shirtsleeves down and buttoned them as a shivering breeze sprang up. Its source was southwest.He hastened toward Mosul and his train, his heart encased in the icy conviction that soon he would be hunted by an ancient enemy whose face he had never seen.But he knew his name.This all started when Regan started playing with the ouiji board. People, just don't do it.Regan's mom Chris who is a movie star let her do it because she didn't think there was any harm in it. Although, she did have some trepidation when Regan started talking about a \"Captain Howdy.\"Then things started to happen. Chris had Regan taken to all kinds of doctors and psych's until they finally said they need a priest. Ya think?Chris was able to get in touch with Father Karras through some peeps but he had to spend time with Regan to prove to the Bishop an exorcism was needed. The kind of proof he had to look for in the book was ridiculous. With all of the stuff going on with Regan they must have been out of their damn mind! That should have happened with no problems.And then we finally get Father Merrin =) I loved him and Karras.As the stranger reached up to remove his hat, Chris was nodding her head, and then suddenly she was looking into eyes that overwhelmed her: tht shone with intelligence and kindly understanding, with serenity that poured from them into her being like the waters of a warm and healing river whose source was both in him and yet somehow beyond him; whose flow was contained and yet headlong and endless.\"I'm Father Lankester Merrin,\" he said.At any rate, the movie and the book were disturbing. Both in their own ways. The movie was scarier but the book had more detailed, disturbing stuff. Now I can only read normal horror for awhile!!Enjoy!!!!MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List"

        "user_review": "Curiosity compels you to read this!THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILSIt was kinda hard to decide the rating on this novel.If I'd think only on the raw reading experience, I would say that it was a 3-star material.However, I had to ponder about the whole additional info and further development of characters compared with my experience with the film adaptation (which certainly is one of my favorite horror films). So, I think that the fairest rating is giving a solid 4-star rating.Certainly due all those deeper details in the original book, I think that novel & movie make an irresistible combo to do.You watched the film, and then you'll appreciate even more the extended information that you'll find in the original novel, but in matters of frightening, well the movie has a clear advantage, but don't dismiss the novel so quickly.Since, may be not the best horror novel that I've ever read,......but certainly the book has......something to compel you to read it, and have it a huge respect to it.MOVIE V. BOOK: DAWN OF POSSESSIONI am not surprised if almost any reader has watched the film before reading the novel.....And my case wasn't any different.I have watched the three film versions: Original theatrical, \"The Never-Before-Seen\" version and the \"Extended Director's Cut\". Any comment that I'd make in this review about the film adaptation it will be based on the latest mentioned version, the \"Extended Director's Cut\", due it's the most complete and also it's the one that I have on Blu-ray so it's the one that I have more fresh on my mind.It's interesting how the film is generally accepted as the most terrifying movie of all time, while the novel doesn't keep that distinction. Actually the debate about which novel is the most terrifying of all, it's an endless dispute that I'm sure the general reading community never would be able to agree in a specific novel.While the imagination is the best special effects generator, I have to admit that it wasn't so shocking to read scenes than in the visual presentation where they are truly scary.Even, I don't know if there was the choice of words used in the narrative of the book, since I think that I'd some \"technical\" difficulties to visualize some of those scenes, if I wouldn't have previous notion of how they supposed to look like, thanks to the film.PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATESo, I am still glad of having read the original novel, since not matter the film adaptation covered the most important elements of the general storyline;......the novel indeed gives you enlighting info about the background of the characters, even \"new\" characters that didn't appear on the movie version, and deeper development of many of the scenes.On the film, you never have doubt that there is a demon inside of Regan,......but in the novel, there are plausible scenarios causing suspicions on other characters, with the chance of a more rational explanation.So, not so ironically, in the same way that you have faith to believe in God, well, the story requires of you to have \"faith\" to believe in the existence of The Devil.That, it's something so curious about many priests in Catholic Church, that I understand that there must be an investigation to discard a simpler explanation to some situations, but it seems that if you say that you're possessed by The Devil or to the contrary, you were witness of the word of God, in any case, the priests will see you as a perfect nut job to send to some psychiatric asylum.So, while the priests are supposed to believe in God, it's like they don't want to believe in the existence of The Devil, that's it's quite odd, since they are both sides of the same religious coin.Also, some elements in the novel, that you may perceive as \"random\" in the film version, even not clarify enough for really understanding why they are in the story, those elements are well developed on the novel and even making ties to the demon inside Regan that you may didn't think about before.Moreover, some reactions and conducts of the characters, knowing key info about their pasts, you can rationalize better why they are reacting in such ways.Even some conversations, they are the same in terms of dialogue,butthe mood of them are perceived in a different way in the book, giving some new angles to the dynamics between characters.SPEAKING OF THE DEVILThat's exactly what I expect when I decide to read a book (original novel or novelization) when I already watched the film adaptation.Since while I invest only two hours to watch the movie, I can invest like a week (or more) to read a novel. So, if I read just the exact story on the book, I think that it would kinda pointless, but if I got enough additional info,......certainly then, it was well invested time.I think that the most effective element on the construction of the story is that you get a lot of arguments and plausible explanations of what it's going on, so in some reverse psychology gimmick, you get to believe more and more that Regan is indeed possessed by a demon.While in some other novels where they approach the paranormal angle directly, the reader tends to accept it without a doubt.Maybe you don't believe in The Devil or in God even, but don't worry,......since you also can say that you don't believe in Jupiter (the planet, not the Roman god) and that doesn't make that that planet isn't out there.Many people are atheists until they have to face a demon by themselves.And it's not like that I am saying that you have to believe in the Christian God, since while I am Catholic, my wish is only that all people believe in some higher power, that you may name whatever you prefer, but believe, in something higher than us.Since some others may call as unrealistic, to believe in gods or higher powers,......for me, not believing in some higher power, I'd call it as sad.Believe in God. Beware of The Devil. Both are real, not matter if you believe in them or not.Getting back to the book, I recommend the novel for any fan of the film and wishing to get a deeper developement on the story.P.S. (Updated Jan, 13th, 2017)I just knew that William Peter Blatty passed away. I'm glad that I was able to read his most iconic work way before he would die."

I thought this priest was going to try and cast out a demon and a little girl was going to cough chunks of puke on him. I had no idea what sort oflayersof insanity I was dealing with here.Ok, ok, ok.Did anyone else think it was fucknuts that all these psychiatrists just assume all tween & teen kids are like the X-men and might possibly develop psychic and telekinetic powers?What the hell?!Was this an ACTUAL thing in the 70s?Like, oh it's all normal that she canread my mindandtoss shit across the room, which is apparently COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from demon possession.She isliterallylevitating the bed across the room like a magic carpet while spewing vomit and speaking in an entirely different voice, and Father Karrass is over there with his finger on her pulse talking about how her heartbeat is steady so it must just be NORMAL PSYCHIC PHENOMENA.omgthatisnotathing!No, sir. What you have there is 100% some freaky demon shit.I also thought Father Karrass was boring. I was so tired of hearing about his inner struggle with his faith. I'm not religious and I understand why someone may struggle with it, so I sympathized to an extent. But either you jump on that train or you don't. And by the end of it, I was practically screaming at him to shit or get off the pot because I couldn't get behind his glee every time he thought for a second that the Regan wasreallydemon-possessed.I guess in his mind if there was a devil, there had to be a God.Dude! There has to be a better time to work out your crisis of faith!And oh god. This was gross.Some of the shit the demon made the little girl do was horribly disturbing. I was quite literally cringing while listening to it.The scene where she's terrified and crying and then the demon takes over and has her stab herself in the vagina with that crucifix? I feel queasy even now. I don't see how that scene was necessary as anything other than vile shock value.There were quite a few icky masturbation scenes and incredibly nastyadultthings that it said that got the point across that the demon was horrendous without that level of nastiness.Fuck! Just awful.I don't know. I was bored with the religious stuff, sickened by all the gross descriptions, and yet still rooted to the spot like a gawker watching a train wreck.I'm glad I read this one and I doubt I'll ever forget it.It. Is. Something. Good? Bad? Like I said, I don't know!BUT IT IS SOMETHING.The audio version I listened to was published by HarperAudio and was read by the author, William Peter Blatty. Dude had one of those menacing voices that you wouldn't want to hear in a dark alley."

        "user_review": "I really enjoyed this one. It has all the elements of eerie paranormal horror with some mystery. The plot involves a little girl who's life goes from normal to complete terror. The little girl, Regan, starts playing with a ouija board and an unknown presence begins communicating with her. The unwanted entity, who goes by the name of Mr. Howdy, slowly becomes problematic. As with all paranormal activity, the plot tracks the demonic activity commonly seen in the four stages: infestation, oppression, obsession, and eventual possession of the little girl. The plot is riddled with psychiatric, religious, and occult-witchcraft fervor that adds to the atmospheric heaviness leading to the exorcism.'Could you help an old altar boy, Father?'- The Demon'And Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\"And he answered, \"Legion, for we are many.\"'- Mark 5:9The book is well-written and flows very nicely. All the characters are well-developed and life-like. All the characters have their personal demons and struggle with them in the story. The overall tone throughout the book is eerie and solemn. For me this is tied with Stephen King'sSalem's Lotfor creepiness. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Thanks!"

        "user_review": "Amasterpiece...unqualified, unadulterated and unequaled.How better to describe the definitive,40th Anniversaryedition of one ofTHEclassic horror novels of the20th century...rendered in audio format and narrated with passion, verve and pitch-perfect delivery byWilliam P. Blattyhimself.I've seen both the original and extended, remastered versions ofThe Exorcistseveral times and believe it ranks among the finest horror films ever made. Until this week, I had never read the source novel. Now that I have, let me add to the film's list of accolades that it's also one of the best film adaptations of a classic novel that I have experienced (along withThe Princess BrideandNo Country for Old Men).I'm going to test the limb and walk out onto it by assuming that most people, even if for some inexplicable or metaphysical reason have not either read the book or seen the movie, are familiar enough with the basic plot that I can dispense with any fear of spoilers. A sweet, pre-teen girl getssoul-jackedby a demon and proceeds to expel various manner of noxious excreta from her various orifices while hurling more barbs and insults than a Don Rickles standup routine. Throw in a grizzled exorcist, a dogged detective and a Jesuit priest with serious mommy issues whose suffering a crisis of faith and you've got the playbill for this diabolical dance of dread.Thus, wifhout worrying about spoilage, I am going to mention briefly what struck me most about the book and then finish with a quick \"compare and contrast\" describing where I thought the film and the novel, respectively, were the superior product.First and foremost, the single most impressive aspect of the book for me was the dense, lushtastically, beautiful prose employed by Blatty while converting this story from mind to paper. Given that Blatty did not become a prolific author (to my knowledge at least), I always assumed that the novel was standard fair that had just received a fabulous hollywood makeover into a successful film. Not only was I all the way wrong, but the film actually loses the rich psychologically melodramatic flavor of Blatty's verse. In the novel, everything is hyper real and a casual look or a fleeting feeling might be imbued with vast significance. A little like an updated version of Lovecraft meets Tolstoy meets Kafka. I thought it was wonderful and attained the rank of esteemed literature in my opinion. A heart-feltBOO-YAHto Mr. Blatty for his slick, stylish sentencing.Okay, let's compare a contrast shall we....Movie was Better than the Book:(***Warning: shots from the film below may be shocking to some***)The visual effects employed in the movie were somegascreamscary at a gut level that they had mytwig and berriescrawling up my tummy tonuzzleagainst my liver. Thus, most of the following are moments in which the written word of Blatty just couldn't compete on the terror scale with the film. Beginning with:1.The Face of Evil: The transformation of nice, innocent Linda Blair into one of the foulest,fugliestfreak shows in film history is something that the book could not adequately convey.The mismatched, demonic eyes...the pasty, cracked andscrobiculatedskin, the raspy\"Barry White with a head cold\" voice...it's enough to cause temporary motor ataxia. The book, as good as it was, could not match this kind of visual perfection for visceral terror.2.The \"Crucifix\" Scene: We all know the scene I'm talking about so let's not belabor the point and allow this to slide into something we might all regret.Let's all just back away and proceed without further comment, except maybe a cringing\"ouch baby, very ouch.\"3.The \"Owl Head\" scene: Up next after\"the #1 thing never to do with a Crucifix\"is the immediately following scene in which little Regan does the full 360 degree, spine-defying glance around. I almost dropped my digesting dinner when I first saw it:If you are ever feeling irregular, this scene works better than a bran muffin and cup of coffee.4.The \"Crab Walk\" scene: Only in the \"extended\" version, this bit of demonic gymnastics reallyshivered my timbers:5.Three words:Max Van Sydow:Nuff said.The Book was Better than the Movie:In general, in almost every particular beyond the items mentioned above, the book was superior to the film and in some cases vastly so. Here are just the top reasons that come to mind.1.Again, the Writing: I know, I know...I mentioned this above but dammit it really is that good. Blatty's prose sucks you in with his vivid, impassioned prose that employs \"over the top\" nuance to make every step in the story feel like a necessary, critical piece of the puzzle. I can understand some feeling smothered by the narrative, but I found it enthralling.2The Demon: This was one of several key pieces of information that did not translate well on the screen. The film leads the audience to believe that the demon possessing Regan is Satan himself. This is based in the quote: \"I'm Father Karras\" and the response \"and I'm the Devil.\" However, the book goes on to make clear that the demon is actually just that...a demon named Pazuzu. This ties into the beginning of the film.3.Is it Real?: The movie leaves no doubt that Regan was possessed and that she is saved when the demon jumps ship into Father Karras before the \"now possessed\" priest does a Greg Louganis out of the window. While mostly free from doubt, the novel does a superb job of leaving just enough of a crack open so that the question is never completely answered. I thought this added a substrate of eeriness to the story.4.Father Dyer and Detective Kinderman: I may be one of the few people that loved Exorcist III (not to be confused with the visual turd known as Exorcist II). One of my favorite aspects of E3 was the witty banter and close friendship between Father Dyer and Bill Kinderman (played by George C. Scott). Turns out a chunk of their dialogue came from this book and their relationship is developed to a significant extent in these pages. Major bonus for me.5.The Smell and Sound of Evil: Just as the book could not compete with the visual perfection of the film, the film could not (for obvious reasons) come close to imbuing its telling with the stench described in the novel. The number of times Regan befouls her bed and deposits her insides as an act of belligerence towards Regan's mom or the priests is an aspect of the novel that adds to the vileness of the demon inhabiting this sweet little girl. Also, the dialogue is far more severe in the book than the movie could likely have gotten away with at the time.6.Satanic Worship: One fascinating aspect of the novel that was completely cut from the film is the in depth and detailed depiction of Satanic worship and some of the disgusting, sacrilegious practices performed at black masses. This was almost wholly absent in the film but made for compelling reading.Overall, I loved the movie but think the novel far surpasses it in its artistic merit. It is a true classic and one that I can not give a stronger recommendation for fans of horror.This was a special and very memorable experience. Thank you, Mr. Blatty.5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!I"

Every time I run upstairs to that room I wonder what the hell I'm going to see next. In the textbooks this is placed in the category called dissociative psychology. The paranormal is more freaky to me than most other horror concepts.♠️It's interesting, thinking shrink a moment, that M. Scott Peck the psychiatrist (The Road Less Traveled) believed in this phenomenon and was in on a few exorcisms himself. It's also interesting that like many other aspects of the horror genre (vampires, ghosts, ripper-style-killers, haunted houses) this one never goes away despite all the bad press it gets real life.At Easter, Russel Crowe's new movie, The Pope's Exorcist, came out, and it's based on the case files of the (late) chief exorcist of Roma, Gabriel Amorth. I've read the case files (there are two books published). The film has actually received very good reviews and it's been commended for its quality acting. I've not seen it yet.♠️In any case The Exorcist is very much a creepy read. It's not just about the horror of the darkness. It's also about the horror of the human.There were two spins, made for TV movies, called simply The Exorcist. I thought the first season was particularly striking.♠️An immortal line from one of the priests (Fr Marcus): \"We stand in the doorway and we push back the darkness. Remember?\"♠️Ten dark stars ♠️"

        "user_review": "A great re-read for this time of year. Here is my original review for your perusal.WIlliam Peter Blatty's groundbreaking novel caused many waves at the time of its publication, though it is thought that the accompanying movie might have been even more controversial. I chose to embark on this journey, more out of curiosity than anything else. Knowing the premise, I thought I would indulge before the season of ghouls and other spine-tingling things is fully upon us. Chris MacNeil is a screen actress and lives in Georgetown with her daughter, Regan. Quite the typical twelve, Regan enjoys some independence, but is happy to engage with her mother on a regular basis. When Regan begins to exhibit strange behaviours, Chris cannot help but seek out some medical advice, none of which yields firm answers. When the oddities begin to manifest themselves into verbal and physical attacks on others, Chris is left to grasp at straws and is pushed in the direction of a psychiatrist. The name she is given, interestingly enough, is Father Damien Karras. A Jesuit, Karras works in the parish just on the other side of the MacNeil home. When Karras agrees to come visit Regan, he is fearful, yet baffled as well, though will not jump to the idea of possession, even as Chris pushes for an exorcism. With no religious ties, the MacNeils seem highly unlikely to have a demon in their lives, but nothing else seems plausible. Karras takes an academic approach to the situation and, after numerous encounters with Regan and her alternate personality, he wonders if there might be something to this talk of demonic possession. Regan appears to have all the signs and exhibits numerous tendencies that Karras has found in scholarly articles over the centuries. With a desecration in the local parish church and the gruesome death of Chris' friend, a local homicide detective is poking around, engaging with Karras at every turn, though no one freely shares the goings-on in the MacNeil home, which might explain at least part of these occurrences. After making his argument to the Church about the needs for some form of Catholic intervention, Karras proceeds to arm himself to enter Regan's domain, ready to do battle with whatever is inside her. It is then that things take a turn for the worse and Karras' entire being is tested. Blatty penned this sensational piece that, even close to a half-century later, will still send chills chills up the reader's spine. Highly recommended for those who love a great thrill ride and can stomach some graphic descriptions and language.In one of my previous reading challenges, I pushed members to compare a book to its screen adaptation, hoping to see the parallels and great differences. Having recently indulged in the cinematic production of this book, it is difficult for me to divorce the two, as they complement one another so well. I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie and have done so on multiple occasions. While it was produced in 1973 and some of the technology is understandably outdated, it packs a punch and was surely quite thrilling at the time. Damien Karras is a central character in the book and his presence is felt throughout, both through his personal struggles with his faith and the dedication he had when thrust into the middle of the demonic possession of a young girl. Karras begins as a distant figure, who struggles to come to terms with his mother's illness and, upon her death, seeks to leave the umbrella of the Catholic Church. However, his character grows as he becomes a well-grounded scholar and seeks to understand what is going on with Regan MacNeil and her obvious struggles with mental stability. Chris MacNeil is also a key member of the story and her struggle to understand her daughter proves to be an ongoing theme the reader will discover. The angst and utter helplessness is something that any parent would struggle to accept, forcing Chris to turn to the experts, none of whom have the answers she wants. One cannot review this book effectively without mentioning Regan and the demon that appears to be embedded within her, as it is this that proves to offer the ultimate spine tingling. The struggles the young girl has and the demon displays push the book out of the realm of simple defiance and into an area not seen by many books of the time. The raw and unedited language proves useful—needed, even—to fulfil that complete sentiment of possession. Many readers may not like it, as I am sure scores found it problematic when the book was published, but it serves to take the book to a level that makes it all the more believed. A handful of other characters and a few interesting sub-plots keep the reader engaged and ready to see where Blatty is taking things. The story itself is quite well done and has been able to stand the test of time. While exorcisms are no longer commonplace, their allure has not diminished, be it in the published work or cinematic presentation. Blatty slowly develops the demonic aspect in such a way that the reader can see it creeping up and spiking at just the right moment. Layering the narrative with some key research, revealed by Father Karras, proves to substantiate the larger theme and keeps things from getting too fanciful. Those with a strong constitution and who can handle some strong language will surely find something in this book to keep them up late at night. I know I'll likely put this on a list of books to read when I want a real chill, though will have to make sure the audio is not streaming when Neo's around!Kudos, Mr. Blatty, for keeping me enthralled throughout. I may have to check out some more of your work in the coming months, as you sure know how to tell a story!Love/hate the review?

I'm sure most of you have seen the movie.If you found the movie scary, the book is more horrifying in lots of different ways that I was unprepared for. I think it's because your imagination is in overdrive.There's scenes in the book that had me cringing, gasping, and I was creeped the f!¢k out.Also, the description of Black Mass was disturbing and I was on Wiki to look up more information. Holy Catholic hell?!High points of the book for me:All conversations with the demon and the slow, devastating change of Regan.Low points of the book for me:Lieutenant Kinderman (just couldn't get into the character) and too much information on Father Karras's background.I'm not sure why I didn't want his background. I guess I just wanted him to finally get to the action of saving Regan. I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one because the backstory was crucial to his faith.The movie at the end scared the bejesus out of me and the book's ending is also scary but I was still able to sleep last night. Ha!I think the Hollywood special effects at the end of the movie must have really scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.Overall,The Exorcistis a creepy and chilling classic.I really enjoyed this book and this is a must read for horror lovers!"

        "user_review": "You gotta be impressed with a book that inspires a movie that managed to turn entire generations off of pea soup.Chris MacNeil is an actress who is filming a movie in Georgetown when her young daughter Regan starts to exhibit bizarre behavior, and since medical science fails to provide any answers she turns to Father Damien Karras for blah, blah, blah, blah. There's no point in a plot summary because we all know the set up on this one. It's also one of those books where the film version has become so well known that it's nigh on impossible to separate the two versions. In fact, I don't see how anybody could read this without hearingTubular Bellsin their head.So just to get this out of the way: The movie is better. That's not to say that the book is bad. Blatty does a very good job of putting us in a normal early '70s setting, and then he slowly turns the dials up from what seem to be mild annoyances to the point where Regan has been turned into a head-spinning puppet of the devil. I particularly liked how there's a systematic investigation of all the non-supernatural explanations for Regan's behavior, and that when the subject of an exorcism is first brought up it's presented as a kind of psychological shock treatment rather than a needed religious ritual.The book has more of an underlying theme of questioning whether Regan is possessed that the movie lacks in part because once you see that kid's demonic features and her head spin all the way around on screen, you know it's supernatural in origin. Whereas the book can spend more time on the whole question of whether she is or isn't while making the answer more a bit more ambiguous.Father Karras, a Jesuit psychiatrist suffering from his own crisis of faith, is also a great character to eventually put in the middle of this, and the way he swings from doubt to belief is well done. It's also a nice twist that he's kind of secretly hoping that Regan does have a demon in her because it would validate his beliefs. That doesn't prevent him from questioning everything and seeking hard evidence to prove it. However, I did get a laugh that at this point in the '70s Blatty thought there was enough evidence for the existence of ESP to have Karras consider things like telepathy and telekinesis possible without being demonic in nature.So it's a solid horror story that plays more with the suspense of making you question what's happening to Regan rather than just making you ascared of the Devil like the movie does.One personal note: I had been meaning for a while to reread the old paperback I've had for years as part of my Rubbermaid Treasure reviews, but I just never seemed to get around to it. Then Audible had this on sale shortly before Halloween so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally get it done. It was only after downloading it that I learned that this version is actually the 40th anniversary edition in which the author rewrote parts of it, and since I last readThe Exorcistsomething like 25 years ago I have no idea how much it differs from the original. So already this thing has turned from a simple gimmick review to what felt like a pain in the ass.Since I don't have the time and/or patience to figure out all the differences I won't dig into that, but I'm not calling it a Rubbermaid Treasure either since it's technically a different book. I know that nobody but me cares about the stupid internal logic I use, but it nags at me if I don't explain what I'm doing and why.I'll also note that Blatty himself is the narrator for most of it, and it confirms my belief that most authors just shouldn't read their own works aloud. Blatty isn't the worst I've heard, and he seems to delight in evil laughter and doing the demon voice, but this really could have used a professional actor/narrator. It's even weirder that he reads the Regan parts early on, but then a woman is brought in to do a child's voice later to speak and sing as Regan's 'actual' voice once she is possessed. It's just jarring."

        "user_review": "It's no surprise to me that this book was a very spiritual read for me. I knew, considering the topic, that this was going to come down to a showdown between light and dark, good and evil, God and Satan.In which case, there could only really be one clear outcome. But more on that later. I'm going to try to be as spoiler free as I can considering some people may not have read this *or* haven't seen the movie, in fact, it would help you to know that I only saw the movie when I was very young and I kept my eyes closed most of the time, so even though this book is old, there are those who have intentions of reading it and don't want the story spoiled.That being said, if you want to go into this book totally blind, maybe skip the rest of this review and just know this: I recommend this book for fans of horror. It was well written, it scared me pretty damn good and it had great, memorable characters. It's classic, legendary horror that must be read if you consider yourself a big fan of the genre.\"for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.\" Rev. 12:10At the beginning of this story, I was a little bored. I grew restless with the mother, Chris and all the scenes around her acting career. I felt like her parenting left much to be desired and found myself already blaming her for what I knew was coming, who lets their 11 year old child play with Ouija boards?? Especially considering that child already has a made up friend that talks to them through the Ouija Board and the child is becoming increasingly afraid of it??Um, anyways. Now that I finished the book, I think it is the intention of the author to cast doubt and blame at all the adults in the story, for us to stand as accusers of one another when really, our battle isn't with each other, but with something much, much worse. Something that wants us to be wrapped up in our hate and anger and displaced blame so that we are found weak and distracted.\"But the evil spirit answered them, \"Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?\"And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.\" Acts 15:15-16I think this is one of the scariest verses from scripture. The demon possessed man says to some people trying to perform an exorcism and cast out demons, hey look: I know the name of Jesus and I know the name of Paul, but I have no clue who you guys are and I'm going to kick your ass.There were so many times this scripture came to mind while I read this book. People just don't know what the hell to do when they are dealing with demonic activity and truth be told: If you don't know what you're doing, DON'T EFFING CALL UPON IT! You know what I mean?? That's my ultimate warning and what I learned from this story, maybe you don't believe in demons, that's fine—whatever, then you don't care either way about them, you're indifferent, so BE indifferent, I wouldn't run around and tempt it or dare it, like people who say they aren't allergic to poison oak so they rub it all over themselves?? NOT SMART.And maybe you do believe in demons, like me so you just make wide circles around that stuff okay? Don't touch it! Don't think you're so faithful and pious you'd know what to do in a situation like this.That's why this book was so terrifying.It scared the hell out of me.But I loved the different way the characters approached it—The detective with his logic and sleuthingThe Father with his background in psychologyThe Exorcist with his unflinching faithEven the mother scored points with me in the end with her unwavering plea for help.I cried as she begged for help. I could empathize with her as she sought medical, mental and spiritual help for her daughter in horrific crisis.I really loved the ending too but I don't want to spoil anything. I'll just leave a fitting scripture:\"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.\" John 15:13Lastly, while parts of this story were very difficult for me to read because they were so crude and blasphemous, I thought it was, in contrast, a beautiful story of sacrificial love against impossible danger. So I gladly mucked up my heart and my mind with grotesque language and offensive, vivid details in order to finish. I wanted to see that outcome I was waiting for...and it was delivered as expected. My review would have been very different if it didn't go the way I thought it would."

        "user_review": "\"We mourn the blossoms of May because they are to whither; but we know that May is one day to have its revenge upon November, by the revolution of that solemn circle which never stops - which teaches us in our height of hope, ever to be sober, and in our depth of desolation, never to despair.\"The unusual occurrences in the MacNeil house could easily be explained away - rats in the attic, misplaced furniture - but the disturbing changes in Regan MacNeil's behaviour could not. Doctors are unable to diagnose what could have caused this shift in personality, so Regan's mother turns to Father Damien Karras, who is suffering from his own lack of faith.I'm finally writing a proper book review for one of my favourite books of all time after reading it for the third time. But let's go way back to the start… The Exorcist was pretty much my gateway into reading horror. Growing up I hated horror, you couldn't have paid me to watch a horror movie - I blame my brothers forcing me to watch Freddy Krueger at a very young age and mentally scarring me - but in my late teens, I was intrigued. I started off by watching the Scream movies to ease me into the genre, but pretty quickly my movie choices escalated into what is considered one of the most terrifying movies of all time - The Exorcist. It quickly became one of my favourite movies and I decided I needed to read the book. And so my journey into horror literature began.I remember thinking the book wouldn't be as scary the movie, but boy was I wrong. I think the book is somehow more terrifying. Granted, we don't have the incredible cinematography or that haunting score, but what we have instead is a slow and tense build as Regan falls under the possession of Pazuzu. During my readalong of this book a number of people seemed to be surprised by William Peter Blatty's prose. A lot of people were like \"Shit, this guy can write\". And he can! After reading this, Legion and The Ninth Configuration, he would rank as one of my favourite authors, and so I take a lot of pleasure in people \"discovering\" Blatty as a writer.Another surprising aspect for a number of people was how emotional the book is. I shed a few tears at the end myself. Damien Karras is one of the most well-written and believable characters I've ever come across. He struggles with his faith as he tries to decipher exactly what is happening with Regan and you can really feel the turmoil he is going through. He is a psychologist as well as a priest, so I found it really interesting to get inside his mind and follow his thought process and research - is Regan possessed or can this be explained by some psychological disorder? As someone who believes in demonic possession, I find these sections of the book incredibly informative. And they help me build my argument for people who try to tell me that these things don't exist because all the symptoms can be explained away by science. In my opinion, they can't. *insert sassy emoji*This book is one of the very very few that I struggle to read in bed at night. I've become very desensitised to horror, but I think a lot of us still have certain triggers that overwhelm us and send our brain into overdrive. Demonic possession is one of my triggers, as are murderous home invaders (I'm looking at you Golden State Killer). As well as being unnerving and scary, it gets pretty uncomfortable to read at times, particularly when it comes to trying to imagine a young girl screaming expletives in a growling voice coupled with her constant projectile vomiting. And the crucifix scene. I honestly felt like I needed to go to mass after reading that scene. It will always remain one of the most horrific sections I've ever read.One of my favourite aspects of The Exorcist, and Blatty's works in general (what I've read so far anyway), is his examination of good vs evil. This seems to be a recurrent theme and one that he is very accomplished at exploring. This merely isn't a story about the possession of a young girl, but its really a commentary on a vast range of topics such as faith and the lack of it, to what exists after death, if anything exists at all. It might be presented as \"horror\" on the surface, but really it goes so much deeper than that.All the stars!! It somehow gets better on each read."

I was just a young boy when the film was released and remember that there was heaps of controversy at the time. Ambulances and police were rushing to theatres because people were fainting and screaming with hysteria. In some extreme cases priests were called. I know that the film was back in theatres a while ago and my partner and I went to see it again with our nephew and niece. They were both in their twenties back then and I recall them laughing all the way through the film. I guess times and tastes have changed. The book is great and the original film too, whatever the younger generation may think. The new TV series is good though, I must admit. I think it stars Ben Daniels as the priest.🐯👍"

        "user_review": "The Exorcist (The Exorcist #1), William Peter BlattyAn elderly Jesuit priest named Father Lankester Merrin is leading an archaeological dig in northern Iraq and is studying ancient relics.After discovering a small statue of the demon Pazuzu (an actual ancient Assyrian demon), a series of omens alerts him to a pending confrontation with a powerful evil, which, unknown to the reader at this point, he has battled before in an exorcism in Africa.Meanwhile, in Georgetown, a young girl named Regan MacNeil is living with her famous mother, actress Chris MacNeil, who is in Georgetown filming a movie. As Chris finishes her work on the film, Regan begins to become inexplicably ill.After a gradual series of poltergeist-like disturbances in their rented house, for which Chris attempts to find rational explanations, Regan begins to rapidly undergo disturbing psychological and physical changes: she refuses to eat or sleep, becomes withdrawn and frenetic, and increasingly aggressive and violent.Chris initially mistakes Regan's behavior as a result of repressed anger over her parents' divorce and absent father. After several unsuccessful psychiatric and medical treatments, Regan's mother, an atheist, turns to a local Jesuit priest for help as Regan's personality becomes increasingly disturbed.Father Damien Karras, who is currently going through a crisis of faith coupled with the loss of his mother, agrees to see Regan as a psychiatrist, but initially resists the notion that it is an actual demonic possession.After a few meetings with the child, now completely inhabited by a diabolical personality, he turns to the local bishop for permission to perform an exorcism on the child. The bishop with whom he consults does not believe Karras is qualified to perform the rites, and appoints the experienced Merrin—who has recently returned to the United States—to perform the exorcism, although he does allow the doubt-ridden Karras to assist him.The lengthy exorcism tests the priests both physically and spiritually. When Merrin, who had previously suffered cardiac arrhythmia, dies during the process, completion of the exorcism ultimately falls upon Father Karras.When he demands that the demonic spirit inhabit him instead of the innocent Regan, the demon seizes the opportunity to possess the priest. Karras heroically surrenders his own life in exchange for Regan's by jumping out of her bedroom window and falling to his death, regaining his faith in God as his last rites are read.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: سال 1995میلادیعنوان: ج‍ن‌گ‍ی‍ر؛ نویسنده: وی‍ل‍ی‍ام‌ پ‍ی‍ت‍ر ب‍لات‍ی‌؛ مت‍رج‍م: ب‍ه‍رام‌ اف‍راس‍ی‍اب‍ی‌؛ ت‍ه‍ران ن‍ش‍ر ال‍ب‍رز، 1372؛ در 355ص، مصور؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20مهمانگونه که از عنوان کتاب پیداست، روایت یک «جن گیر»، یعنی پیرامون «جن» و تسخیر انسان است، ماجرای دختری است، که «جن» او را تسخیر کرده، کتاب «جن گیر»، بسیار شناخته شده، و با گذشت چند دهه، هنوز هم یکی از بهترین رمانهای ژانر ترس، و با گذشت زمان، هنوز جزو ترسناکترین داستانهای جهان است؛ و بسیاری از رمانها، و داستانهای ژانر ترس و وحشت، از این کتاب الهام بگرفته اند؛ فیلم و سریال، با اقتباس و الهام از این داستان نیز ساخته شده است.؛ نخستین فیلم، که دو سال پس از چاپ کتاب، یعنی سال هزار و نهصد و هفتاد و یک میلادی، که کتاب چاپ شده و مورد استقبال چشمگیر قرار گرفته بود؛ فیلمی با همین نام «جن گیر» ساخته ی «پازوزو» نیز به سینمای جهان عرضه شد، که این فیلم نیز از بهترینهای سینمای ترس میباشدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 04/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "Boil it all down and The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty is about faith.There is the demonic possession of Regan McNeil and the horrors that are described as a part of that invasion, the night and day distinction between a young girl and the maniacal, infernal force that changed her.Also fascinating to read is the reactions of the family and friends of the girl and the forced dynamic of this group experiencing such an outrage. Then there is the psychological questions, the detective work piecing all the fragments of evidence together and even a couple of interesting sub-plots. There is the great struggle between the elder exorcist and his devilish foe.But what drives this work; the central focus is not the blasphemy going on in Regan's bedroom, but the spiritual conflict taking place within Father Karras. Blatty has crafted an intricately complete allegory about the modern divergence between strictly rational scientific thought and the traditional ideas about faith and religion. Karras, a Jesuit priest who is also a Harvard trained psychiatrist, is the living embodiment of this diametric clash, not between good and evil but between uncompromising faith and logically defined scientific knowledge. Karras wants the possession, wants to know that a demon has taken up residence in the child, because this will be his definitive sign from God that his faith is real.Finally, in the peaceful words of Father Merrin, the exorcist, Karras finds absolution from his doubts. The obscene heresies graphically described by the author will keep most people of faith away, but for those who can get through this well-written work of speculative fiction, the result may be a strengthening of faith."

        "user_review": "This is a book that, in my opinion, sets the standard for modern horror. Not only is the story disturbing and brilliantly written, but it stays with you for long after you've finished the book. Why? Because it all seems so normal to begin with. All the unnerving things seem to have simple explanations. So, for the longest time, the characters move unaware of the horror to come. For the reader, this soon becomes a experience where it takes little to start extrapolating this semblance of normalcy into everyday life.Was that just the wind, howling outside all night? Was that broken branch after the storm just a normal thing? But why now, and why in the middle of my street? You have no answer, because to be honest there's no answer, but soon Blatty's words, come to give you one:\"You see, the trouble with the signs in the sky, my dear morsel, is that once having seen them, one has no excuse.\"And there you are, hooked searching for signs to prove to youserlf that something normal may not be so normal after all.I'm a fan of this type of horror, the one that leaves a lingering feeling of unreality to our reality, and Blatty is a master in this matter.So, let's talk about the book. The premise is simple: A strange, unexplained mental illness has struck a 12 years old girl. The girl's mother, who is an atheist, consults numerous medical professionals to no avail. All signs point to a demonic-possession, but that's a paranormal phenomenon ridiculed in the modern day as superstition, so how to take the signs seriously?When things get worse, out of desperation, the girl's mother approaches a priest, pleading for an exorcism, but the priest instead of accepting to perform the ritual, sends mother and daughter back to the doctor. Why? Simply because the priest, despite the requirements of his profession, doesn't believe in the existence of the Devil!For the priest, faith has become a matter of philosophical and academic pursuit only. For him, demonic possessions only happened in the holy book, not in today's world. But even then, the priest argues, the demonic possessions in the holy book should be interpreted with sophisticated hermeneutics, to explain the supernatural reality while emphasizing the philosophical, and theological meanings behind the miracles.This is the premise on which Blatty stood to write a captivating tale about faith. Yes, this is horror, but truly disturbing stories only work so well because of their roots in real life, and what is more real than faith? Faith shapes our world, is the lens we used to interpret our life and existence. Indeed, The Exorcist is a allegory about the internal struggles of modern-day religious believers, who, wrestle to adapt their own perception about faith to a world where everything is being rationalized.When first published, the story also raised an interesting question for the modern-day religious believers, when something unexplained happens, why do they often default to a naturalistic explanation --like non-believers do-- over a supernatural one?If you're looking for an outstanding horror novel to read, look no further than the exorcist. Beyond just being a classic, this is one of those near perfect novels that you won't be able put down. It will keep you awake, reading well into the night."

        "user_review": "Having recently seen a film calledThe Last Exorcism, I decided it was finally time to read thefirstexorcism, the one which made masses of people interested in demonic posessions, scared the beejesus out of readers and was made into one of the best films ever.I've seen the film several times, though I've never read the book. I always assumed that it was a cheap potboiler, heavy on shock value (who can forget the green vomit?) and thin on everything else. I was totally wrong.The Exorcistis a classic - but it is a good classic; it's notThe Castle of OtrantoorThe Monk, both of which haven't exactly stood the test of time;The Exorcistis a classic in the way ofRosemary's BabyorI Am Legend, both of which will be remembered and savored by generations of readers in years to come.Since its original publication in the 1971 (what a shock that must have been), the genre known as \"horror\" expanded broadly, and people's tolerancy towards controversy and shock in fiction has vastly increased. So what does makeThe Exorciststill so strong a novel after almost forty years since its first printing?It's not the shock, nor the scare;The Exorcistwas written when no one even thought about countless horror movies and novels that would be so cheap and poor that they'd make people think twice before watching/reading something that would be dubbed with that name. Falls of blood and mountains of dead bodies succesfully dimmed any scares and frights that the reader could have experienced when he was reading this novel in the early 70's. No, no; what affects us so strongly is the inner turmoil of people who live in this text. It's not the monster; it's those he's after. The scary things get old easily and are quickly succeeded by even more scary and gruesome creatures and concepts; the people dealing with them stay the same. Each decade, each year a new icon of evil is introduced and abolished, butfear...fear stays the same.The plot ofThe Exorcistis widely known to practically everyone, but if you haven't read the book or seen the movie I strongly encourage you to do both - in that order - and then come back to read my ramblings. HERE THERE BE A DISCUSSION WHICH REVEALS PLOT POINTS AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE NARRATIVE.The Exorcistopens in northern Iraq, at an excavation site where we first meet Father Lankester Merrin, an elderly priest who's the leader of the excavation dig and has just came upon an interesting discovery - a small statue of a demon juxtaposed with a St.Joseph medal. Father Merrin feels the omen of an ancient, malevolent force looming over him.Meanwhile, in Georgetown, a young girl named Regan MacNeil becomes inexplicably ill. The enrgetic and happy child drastically changes and her mind seems to slowly deteriorate. But to her mother, Chris, something is wrong with Regan on an entire different level - strange noises are heard, objects move in her room. Chris seeks medical help, but the doctors can't find evidence for their theory about Regan's condition being caused by a lesion in the temporal lobe of the brain.Regan's condition worsens - she spits countless obscenities and starts speaking in several languages - and the most shocking image of all: she masturbates with a crucifix. She has strapped down to the bed for her own protection as well as of those around her - Regan's strenght is almost inhuman. The figure bound to the bed doesn't even resemble Regan - it claims to be the devil himself.Desperatedly, non-religious Chris turns to the Jesuit priesthood for help - she wants an exorcism to be performed on her daughter. Enter Father Damien Karras.The descriptions of Regan's demonic behavior - the famous 180 turn of her head - are not as impacting as they were in the 70's, but they still serve their duty well. However, as I said before, it is not the physical manifestation of the demon that is important - it's how people deal with the posession.Chris asks Father Karras to perform an exorcism - an ages old ritual used by the Church to purge the demons out of the posessed. Father Karras explains that a priest cannot simply perform an exorcism and has to get a persmission from the Church - speaking simply, he needs evidence. Father Karras is reluctant to approach his superiors - he is struggling with his own innter turmoil. The horrible sense of betraying his mother as he left her old and alone to enter the priesthood, with scatters of his childhood memories that deepen his sense of guilt. The Father doubts his faith, and he struggles to keep his belief. We see him as an emotional and troubled being, for whom a request to perform the ancient ritual comes as something totally unexpected and irrational. It is the Priest who encourages the non-believing mother to seek out medical help. The priest doesn't want to perform the exorcism, hewantsRegan's case to be scientifically explainable; he wants to think of the exorcism as a forgotten superstition of past times. He seeks proof to encourage the woman that her daughter's condition can be healed medically, taunts what he believes to be Regan's unconsciousness taking the form of \"demons\" about whom she's heard or read in books. But his quest takes an unexpected turn when he sees two words appearing on Regan's stomach, like stigmatas: HELP MEFather Karris turns to the Church for the persmission to do the exorcism, and it is granted to him though he's not allowed to actually perform the ritual. He will be the assistant to Father Merrin, who is revealed to have been suspecting the encounter all along - it's revealed that a long time ago he performed an exorcism in Africa, and it's suggested that the exorcism has wounded him physically, though not spiritually. Father Merrin is a figure that provides comfort and solace to the troubled, but he is old; when he faces the demon it recognizes him, and mocks the elderly priest by saying that this time he will lose.Nevertheless, Father Merrin and Father Karras set out to perform the exorcism.The lenghty ritual tires the priests, both physically and mentally. Father Merrin is strong spiritually but his flesh is long past its prime; though he's desperate to perform the ritual till the demon is exorted, his body fails him and he dies before the demon is casted out.The demon lavishes in his victory, mocking the dead priest; but it is this moment where wheels are turned. The demon is arrogant and pitiless, doesn't consider Father Karras a worthy opponent because it detected doubt in him; however, it is Father Karras who will defeat him. After seeing Father Merrin's sacrifice, Karras decides to give his life for the life of the posessed girl. The demon operates by low means, occuping innocent, defensless children to gain its goals, and it doesn't even acknowledge the idea of selfless love displayed by the priest for the girl. The demon outmathced both priest in a spiritual duel, because of Father Karras's doubt; but faith is more than a matter of doubt, it is goodness and selflesness that is displayed by Father Karras in the ending sequences. The demon is not even sucpecting the troubled priest to be able for such sacrifice and when Father Karras becknons him to enter his body, he lets go of the girl and accepts the invitation; Father Karras uses the remains of his strenght to jump out of the window, and dies at the pavement.In the finale of this dramatic conclusion Father Karras is not brought back to life by God, as some could have expected; he's dying fast, but he dies fulfilled, having captured the demon within him and therefore freeing the girl. He dies free of burden and guilt; his life had purpose, just like Regan's - The demon chose the girl to lure Father Merrin to face him, just as Father Karras was chosen to face the demon and defeat him. But chosen by whom? Blatty gives us the benefit of doubt and doesn't enforce any ideology on the reader, but he also gives us the benefit of hope by emphasizing the inner strenght of the human spirit and faith in the most dire conditions.I'm glad I've finally readThe Exorcist, though I'm also glad I waited so long to do it. The novel offers an insight into the mind and soul of the tragically troubled character of Father Karras, a profound vision that is much more fascinating that all of the demons combined. It illustrates how fragile human spirit can be, but also how strong when it is armed with love and purpose. Heartily recommended."

Demasiado burdo. Después de todo, soy un príncipe.Luego de haber leído \"Los elementales\" de Michael McDowell, me quedé con ganas de subir la apuesta y decidí leer \"El exorcista\".No me equivoqué. La novela posee los más altos ingredientes de terror con los que me haya topado, aunque no haya leído mucho del género y por supuesto posee un suspenso adictivo, propio del estilo de estos libros.Su autor, William Peter Blatty, quien publicó esta novela en 1971, basándose en una experiencia vivida por él mismo en el año 1949, causó un revuelo instantáneo, tanto por la historia narrada, como por los condimentos de alto contenido polémico, repulsivo, escatológico y demasiado violento para la época, llevó en dos años más tarde su novela a la pantalla grande, junto con el director William Friedkin para terminar ganando un premio Oscar por \"Mejor guion adaptado\".Fue tal el impacto de la película en los cines por aquellos años, que mucha gente salía vomitando de las salas. La película se transformó en objeto de culto instantáneo y sigue vigente hasta nuestros días.Es digno de destacar la manera en la que Blatty se informó e investigó en distintas áreas para solventar el argumento de la novela. El autor profundiza sobre la medicina clínica, la psicología, la psiquiatría, la teología, las supersticiones, todo lo referente a posesiones, brujería, hechizos, inquisiciones, civilizaciones antiguas y la religión católica.Los síntomas de Regan se van manifestando de menor a mayor, comenzando con simples explicaciones que los profesionales atribuyen como propios de su edad, como los desórdenes normales previos a la adolescencia para ir incrementándose en complejidad.Tanto médicos, como psicólogos y psiquiatras divagan entre conjeturas tratando de explicar el estado de salud de Regan que incluye hiperactividad, mal genio, insomnio, trastorno hiperkinético, sonambulismo histérico, contracciones clónicas, convulsiones, epilepsia, desdoblamiento de la personalidad, enfermedad mental, desborde psiquiátrico, histeria, esquizofrenia, paranoia hasta llegar a la conclusión de una posible posesión demoníaca.A partir de allí, Chris MacNeall, la madre de Regan completamente desesperada y abrumada, contactará al padre Damien Karras para pedirle que le realice un exorcismo a su hija.El padre Karras, un sacerdote experto en psiquiatría, quien atraviesa una crisis de fe ante la reciente muerte de su madre, batallará en primer lugar contra su propio escepticismo para terminar luchando contra el demonio que consume el frágil cuerpo de Regan.Es aquí donde Blatty nuevamente despliega un bagaje de conocimientos técnicos relacionados a la posesión diabólica y a los exorcismos.Es indudable que, en primer lugar se asesoró con médicos especialistas en la materia y sobre todo contactó a diversos sacerdotes y personalidades eclesiásticas que le brindaron la información necesaria para desarrollar su novela.La inclusión de libros como \"Psicología y patología de los fenómenos ocultos\", \"Posesión\" de Osterreich, \"Los demonios de Loudun\", de Huxley, y \"Parapraxis en el caso de Haizman\" de Freud; \"Posesión por el demonio y exorcismo en la primera época del cristianismo, a la luz de las ideas modernas sobre las enfermedades mentales\", de McCasland, así como extractos de revistas psiquiátricas sobre \"Neurosis de posesión diabólica en el siglo XVII\", y \"La demonología de la psiquiatría moderna\", de Freud no están incluidos por casualidad. Todo esto le da solvencia y credibilidad a la novela.Cuando un comienza a leer la tercera parte llamada \"El abismo\" es allí donde el horror de desata. Todo lo que sucede en la novela será replicado fielmente y sin censura en la película.Algunas escenas y situaciones realmente superan al lector causándole asco, repugnancia e incluso ganas de detener la lectura, desde el lenguaje altamente obsceno que sale de la boca de Regan ya poseída, junto con toda una serie de sustancias, vómitos, flujos, sangre, excrementos, escupitajos y hasta una controvertida escena de masturbación con un crucifijo, hace que uno sobrelleve una lectura verdaderamente tortuosa.Ciertas escenas realmente son difíciles de soportar si tenemos en cuenta que de quien hace y dice todo esto es una niña de doce años.Esta novela no es para lectores susceptible ni para estómagos flojos ni tampoco para aquellos poco acostumbrados a la violencia y la obscenidad.Muchas situaciones chocan al lector, propinándole golpes verdaderamente bajos, pero uno en cierto modo, leyéndola, logra compadecerse de lo que le sucede al personaje de Regan, poseído por un demonio que no le tiene piedad y que la está matando de a poco, mientras su cuerpo maltrecho resiste sus embates, atada a una cama y en dormitorio cuya temperatura es de varios grados bajo cero.Este detalle no es menor. Cuando Dante Alighieri describe el lugar donde se encuentra el Diablo en \"La divina comedia\", está castigando cruelmente a Judas Iscariote en el Cócito, situado en último círculo del infierno, que para variar, está congelado, algo que contrasta con la idea de que el Infierno es un lugar ardiente.Por otro lado, para la película, los actores fueron sometidos a verdaderas temperaturas congeladas que hicieron verdaderamente tortuosas sus actuaciones.Volviendo a la novela, nos encontramos también con otros personajes muy importantes como por ejemplo los personajes que trabajan en la casa de Chris, o sea su mayordomo Karl, la esposa de este, Willie y una joven llamada Sharon quienes tiene implicancia directa en todo el asunto.Y no debemos olvidar al detective Kinderman, que investiga la muerte del director de cine Burke Dennings y sobre todo al verdadero exorcista, el padre Lankenster Merrim, un afamado y experto sacerdote que en la película es personificado por el maravilloso Max Von Sidow.\"El exorcista\" es una novela aterradora, difícil, incómoda, cruda, violenta, visceral y hasta repugnante, pero realmente atrapante.Considero que William Blatty alcanzó la fama a partir de una novela que se salió de todo lo conocido hasta ese momento y que aún hoy, con el agregado de la película de 1973, sigue causando la misma conmoción y espanto que cuando fue publicada."

        "user_review": "\"Maybe the world should burn.\"Epicness.That's the only word I can think of to describeQueen of Shadowsin order to encompass its complexity and awesomeness, because while I lovedThrone of GlassandCrown of Midnightblew my mind away andHeir of Firebroke my heart into teensy tiny pieces, neither of those installments felt as grand as this one -- worlds collided, debts were paid and a queen rose to her glory.\"Let's go rattle the stars.\"I'm going to start by saying that I've read it twice in a matter of days -- once devouring it cover-to-cover, fueled by that insatiable need to find out what the hell happens next (pulling an all-nighter, if I might add), and then simply to savor its cleverness, awed yet again at Sarah's ingenuity. But as I finished it for the second time, I realized something extremely important: QoS is a tribute to strong, tough heroines, main and secondary alike.\"Please,\" Lysandra said, waving a manicured hand, \"you and I are nothing but wild beasts wearing human skins. Don't even try to deny it.\"You will be completely astonished with the unraveling of Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, because in reality you haven't exactly met her until now. You see, she's the same heroine we've come to love during these past 3 (4) books and yet a different persona. Every trait of Celaena Sardothiens is magnified and combined in such a masterful way to create a unique character. She's still an arrogant, stubborn, brave and sassy young woman, but she undergoes a spectacular character-development into a cunning, determined and fierce queen. Aelin is completely in control and she makes a statement in bold capital letters that she doesn't buy any bullshit and that she's ready to reclaim back everything that was taken from her. And oh, boy, she does it in style.\"I went too long without demanding retribution. I have no interest in forgiveness.\"In addition to that, she has matured a long way and, for the first time, she shed her impulsiveness for being open-minded, calculating and often kind. Aelin managed (through those crushing sessions of healing from HoF) to lose some of her darkness and her real strength -- spiritual and physical alike -- finally shone in this installment, making me so proud of her at this point. And I'd bet a good deal that Sam and Nehemia are freaking proud of her too.*sobs*\"I miss you,\" she said. \"Every day, I miss you. And I wonder what you would have made of all this. Made of me. I think—I think you would have been a wonderful king. I think they would have liked you more than me, actually.\" Her throat tightened. \"I never told you—how I felt. But I loved you, and I think a part of me might always love you. Maybe you were my mate, and I never knew it. Maybe I'll spend the rest of my life wondering about that. Maybe I'll see you again in the Afterworld, and then I'll know for sure. But until then … until then I'll miss you, and I'll wish you were here.\"Now onto the next awesome woman and quite possibly my favorite character from this book: Manon Blackbeak. She was completely fabulous in a mind-boggling manner. I never would have expected her wonderful character-development: she is not all about discipline and obedience anymore. She starts wondering. She starts plotting. She starts taking a stand, slowly but surely, like Dorian did in CoM and later in HoF. She's gloriously wicked, but she's no evil and I utterly loved her. I cannot wait for when her defiance will leave the witches kneeling at her feet.And damn, when those two met?! Shots fired. Fireworks exploded. And badassery was brought to a whole new level. It was by far my favorite scene out of the whole novel, managing to exceed my expectations thousand fold -- they were deadly and powerful and so goddamn magnificent I was literally fangirling. The encounter in its entirety was astounding by starting out surprisingly and unfolding in an incredible way that only increased my adoration for both kick-ass chicks.\"We are the masters of our own fates—we decide how to go forward.\"The attention falls equally on some other ladies. Prepare to fall helplessly in love with Asterin. She's so strong and loyal and her story will move you to tears. We finally get reacquainted with Kaltain and she's not in a place full of flying unicorns and pink rainbows -- she's basically in her own hellhole. There were a few fascinating developments that transformed her into a worthy, lethal player. Nonetheless, her inner strength was awe-inspiring and I ended up regretting that we didn't get to know her better before. She was hands down amazing and she has my unwavering respect and admiration.\"She did it for herself. To free herself. And she was entitled to. After what they did, she was entitled to rip the entire damn world to shreds.\"This book allowed us to meet new kick-ass females: Lysandra, who was nothing short of amazing and surprising; Elide Lochan, who was determined and immensely brave; and Nesryn Faliq, who was simply awesome in every way. I loved and cheered for them all.And now let's fuss over the boys. Firstly, Chaol. His reunion with Aelin was all sorts of shit, no, this-can't-be-happening, and I was mad at him for his demeanor. With that being said, I can assure you he remained true to his character throughout the whole book, his loyal, selfless traits reminding me why I like him so much and his insecurities being in sync with his overall upbringing, legacy and priorities. With Dorian's safety being his ultimate goal, his desperation is just gut-wrenching.\"Oath-breaker. Liar. Traitor. Chaol was all of those things now, but not to Dorian. Never to his true king.\"Speaking of Dorian, my sweet, precious and innocent cinnamon roll. He killed me in this book. Killed me with his few and far between chapter POVs that had him in pure, unaltered agony and pain. Killed me with his loneliness, with his sense of being lost, with his acceptance that he'll drown in an ocean of misery and cold. And finally he killed me with his force to constantly fight back, with the desire to tear free of the monster inside him and with the protection he bestowed on his loved ones. He's done kneeling before others and he is forever changed, but wonderfully so. I loved loved loved him, even when he broke my heart.\"I am going to destroy everything you love.\"Aedion was undoubtedly a new favorite of mine. The fact that he's Aelin's male version is only a shade of his real personality -- he had me tearing up and smiling at the same time with his boundless love for his queen and his loyalty and sarcasm were a recipe for instant swooning. Oh, and his father? I went bazinga.\"Behind them, across the hall, the dancers shattered their roses on the floor, and Aedion grinned at his queen as the entire world went to hell.\"We meet again with the King of Assassins, Arobynn Hamel, and he did not disappoint with his cruel, scheming, controlling self. He was a ruthless bastard but the satisfaction I felt when the pupil outwitted the master was priceless. Bon voyage, you shameless asshole.\"Tell me what I must do to atone; tell me to crawl over hot coals, to sleep on a bed of nails, to carve up my flesh. Say the word, and it is done. But let me care for you as I once did, before … before that madness poisoned my heart. Punish me, torture me, wreck me, but let me help you. Do this small thing for me—and let me lay the world at your feet.\"Rowan Whitethorn is yet again a main focus of the book and I enjoyed everything about him. His devotion, his wisdom, his alpha-male intensity and not to mention the rare moments when he let emotions overtake him. Aelin's effect on him really brings out sides we haven't met before and the fact that he was, at times, sweet (yes, I'm talking about the King of Stoicism) continues to blow me away.But the best part about these characters is not even themselves. Their intricate relationships are the real deal. TheBROMANCES ARE FLAWLESS-- Dorian and Chaol redefine friendship, Aedion and Rowan set the backbone of a brotherhood for ages, Aelin and Manon bring a delicious and unpredictable frenemy dynamic to the table and the queen regains female companionship through Lysandra. Aelin and Aedion are even more amazing then I ever would've imagined and their reunion was all kinds of splendid (I was crying, goddamit) and the Thirteen prove again just how much of a family they can be. Besides these, the original trio crawl their way to being once again a marvelous team -- Dorian and Aelin is possibly the best thing ever, maybe only topped by Dorian and Chaol. Banter and kinship and support and dedication are all etched deeply in every single relationship, giving them an almost magical quality.\"For her friends, for her family, she would gladly be a monster. For Rowan, for Dorian, for Nehemia, she would debase and degrade and ruin herself.\"Now -- expect romance. The wowza kind. The slow-burning kind. The tension off the charts kind. One ship is sailing fast, folks, and it is steamy and romantic and snarky and just asdfghjkl. I'm not saying who it is just in case you escaped the spoilers. There are new feelings on the horizon for a certain male and I hope it will come to fruition soon. And and and maybe I'm a fool to hope or even bring it into discussion, but do I sense Dorian and Manon?!?BECAUSE I'M DOWN FOR THAT, MAAS.All my talk about characters shows how incredibly balanced QoS is, because this book is very much plot orientated. So many twists coming from Arobynn and the Valg world and the rebel cause and bitch queen Maeve and the King and the Duke (turns out he's a key player) and I can't even. The Valg plotline is an endless well of terrifying territory and it seems that we'll venture further into their scary world. It's thrilling, jaw-dropping and fabulously written. The last 200 pages or so were a masterpiece, keeping you glued to the pages and at the edge of your seat, but the entire book is darker and bloodier than any of its prequels.\"Elegant, feminine, and utterly wild. Warm, and steadfast—unbreakable, his queen.\"QoS is not necessarily flawless. I have slight complaints -- like Rowan being a bit too soft sometimes and Dorian and Chaol not getting enough page time -- but they don't irk me because I got so much more awesomeness instead (all of the above + Abraxos and Fleetfoot, of course) and I am fully aware we can't have it all; it was almost a 700 pages book! My favorite still remains Heir of Fire though, with QoS and CoM not far behind, because that book broke me into pieces and did not apologize for it. However, QoS did with that phenomenal ending that had me smiling ear-to-ear and teary-eyed at its sheer perfection. It was like SJM personally apologized for every time I cried and sobbed and went crazy over her devastating story and gave me a solace of utter joy. Happiness is not a good enough word to describe what I was feeling at the dinner scene.Yet again, Sarah J. Maas pulled out the big guns and took over the fantasy genre with a gorgeous world, otherworldly characters and imaginative plot. She is my favorite author and, even though I'm aware of her storytelling skills, she continues to bewilder me with each book she creates. I got literally everything I asked for (seriously, my initial \"demands\" can be foundhere), even the things I thought were impossible to come true. So thank you, SJM, for this outstanding book.\"She was the heir of fire.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.\"Queen of Shadowsis a breathtaking continuation to my favorite series -- a truly wild rollercoaster, brilliantly woven with plot twists and thrilling from beginning till end, and also an absolutely beautiful journey sprinkled with countless gut-wrenching moments. Enthralling, action-packed and heartwarming (yes, you read that right), this book deserves every praise known to humankind and I bow down to the queens in eternal awe -- Sarah and Aelin, you're both spectacular. Cannot wait to see what you have in store for us next.\"What do I do?\"She had to swallow before she said, \"You light up the darkness.\"ENJOY! <3P.S.:It pains me to see how a lot of people hate this book due to its main romance. I love Dorian to the moon and back and Doraelin is basically my OTP and for that I could've downright hated CoM, QoS and especially HoF (miss you, Sorscha). Obviously, I didn't, because what a lot of fans fail to acknowledge is that we shouldn't get blinded by the shipping-war. I NEED them to take a step back and appreciate the glorious world Mass created, the ingenious plot and the ever-wonderful characters. Romance was never the main focus of these books, even if it sweetened the installments and gave us butterflies. After all, a choice was bound to happen sooner or later seeing we have such swoon-worthy males around our beloved heroine and need I remind you there are still 2 more books? Anything could change! Maybe everyone will die in the end -- would you prefer that instead of watching your ship sink? (Sarah, please don't get any ideas). Regardless, I've said it times and times again -- as long as Aelin is happy, I'm happy, and if that means Doraelin isn't endgame I'm not going to bawl like a baby about it, because she deserves to have someone at her side and she deserves to choose whomever the hell she wants. Team Aelin forever."

        "user_review": "When my sister told me about an early review that promised really bad things happening to our favorite characters in this installment, I didn't care. I didn't actually think that was true; ItrustedSJMAAS. Butoh, dearnothing could have prepared me for what I was about to face the moment I picked up this damn book. With this review I'm putting these book down and getting some needed rest. I think we all deserve it after dealing with Aelin and the author's bullshit, am I right?Now, let's get down to business.How to ruin a book series by adding absurd romantic subplots and destroying some characters for the sake of a ship: A novel by Sarah J. Maas.Prepare yourself for QUEEN OF BULLSHIT. This one was definitely my most anticipated book of 2015, and reading it was an absolute torture.I'm outraged and sad and deeply disappointed that one of my favorites series is now such a piece of crap, but I'm certain that I am done with SJM's work. What she did to this series--to its characters--is an insult to the readers. This is not a book--this is poorly written fanfiction of theThrone of Glassseries.(If you listen closely you can hear Sam and Nehimia yelling that they didn't die for this shit.)I'm gonna miss you, Celaena Sardothien.The assassin we all loved was murdered. She was sassy, smart, badass and arrogant, but in this bookthe author turned her into a fucking fangirl, Aelin Galathynius. She did not only act out of character--she became dependant on a hot fae dude who's centuries older than her. SJMAAS failed at creating an empowering female character. Aelin Galathynius was a self inserted version of the author, a poor caricature of Celaena Sardothien.If you think that the way Aelin acts in this book is how a queen should be like, Wyrd help y'all.Celaena would never hurt Dorian, yet Aelin was so eager about killing the Crown Prince who was posessed by a demon. She never stopped to think for a damn minute of what her actions would cause to the friends she loved. No--she was so obsessed with Rowan that everything else what pure background. While Chaol and Nesryn worked to free Dorian from his father, Aelin showed the city to her fae companion. She socialized with Lysandra, she wore dresses for Rowan, and she had dinner with her cousin and her new friends. And when they finally managed to rescue Dorian, Aelin had the audacity to tell him she had come back for him. BULLSHIT.She'd kill whoever was needed, whore herself, wreck herself, if it meant getting Aedion to safety.Remember when Celaena said to Dorian\"I'll come back for you\"? Yeah, me neither.Chaol Westfall deserved better than to be destroyed so I ship could happen.The author kept using the Nehemia card to make him look bad. Aelin blamed him for everything--leaving Dorian, having a part in Nehemia's death, working for the King of Adarlan and never killing him. But when he replied,\"You do not get to blame me for that. For his actions.\"But you do get to blame him for things that were out of his control, Aelin? Where's the damn logic.Chaol had run. He'd run, and Dorian had been left to been slaved by the collar.If he had stayed he would have been killed by now, and who would be trying to save Dorian? You? YOU, Aelin?! I thought so.And just to make it even more clear,You should have gotten Dorian and Sorscha out the day the king butchered those slaves.Did you learn nothing from Nehemia's death?Did you somehow think you could win with your honor intact, without sacrificing something? You shouldn't have left him; how could you let him face the king alone? How could you, how could you, how could you?Chaol had to endured this throughout the entire book. Damn, the entire series!He got the worst part. If I recall,Celaena never tried to kill the King, and she worked for him too.So, she's a freaking hypocrite for throwing those accusations to Chaol. SJM made Chaol feel sorry for himself, she made him see himself as a fool for trusting an assassing when HE GOT OVER IT A LONG TIME AGO!!No, Celaena Sardothien certainly did not exist anymore.That woman—the woman he had loved... Perhaps she'd drowned in the vast, ruthless sea between here and Wendlyn. Perhaps she'd died at the hands of the Valg princes.Or maybe he'd been a fool all this time, a fool to look at the lives she'd taken and blood she'd so irreverently spilled, and not be disgusted.I see what you're trying to do, SJMAAS. But I'm no fool. I SEE U, VILLAIN.Chaol Westfall deserves better 2k15#CHAOLWESTFALLDEFENSESQUADI WILL ALWAYS SHIP CHAOLAENA.It's over. They're not endgame according to this damn book. But I still have my copy ofCrown of Midnightthat proves otherwise. SJMAAS changed her mind. She wroteCrown of Midnightwith an idea, and she changed it the moment Rowan showed up.Nesryn Falig was obviously used as a plot device.It seems like SJMAAS didn't want Chaol to end up alone.I can't buy anything written in this book.Chaol Westfall would blush whenever he saw the girls who used to wait for him at his morning runs. He was dedicated to his Prince and King, and yet the author created this poor excuse of him having a relationship with Nesryn Faliq even beforeThrone of Glassso he wouldn't mind seeing Aelin and Rowan together. THAT WAS PATHETIC.A faint sort of amusement shone in her dark eyes. The same sort of amusement that had been there last year whenever they would meet, at inns or in rooms above taverns or sometimes even up against the wall of an alley.Ok that sounds fake but ok.I think what bothers me most about QoS is thatthe sort of closure Celaena and Chaol had inHeir of Firewas thrown to the trash can.I was fine with them not being together anymore, but what they both did in this book felt completely out of place. They acted like kids--SJMAAS pitted them against each other. Reading it was like watching a dummy relationships reality show. And they not having feelings for each other?? I get it, they are over. But when Chaol got hurt Aelin didn't even look at him! And Chaol never cared about Rowan, either. (Actually, Chaol seemed startled by Rowan's beauty, just like everyone else who came across him.)Their past was was erased. Like it never happened.\"It meant something to me. What you and I had. More than that, your friendship meant something to me. I never told you the truth about who I was because I couldn't face that truth.I'm sorry if what I said to you on the docks that day—that I'd pick you—made you think I'd come back, and it would all be fixed.Things changed. I changed.\"@ Sarah J. Maas, WAS THIS FUCKING NECESSARY?!!!!There was so little left of the guard she'd come to care for....Youchanged, not him.You remind me of what the world ought to be; what the world can be, she'd once said to Chaol. Her face burned. A girl had said those things; a girl so desperate to survive, to make it through each day, that\tshe hadn't questioned why he served the true monster of their world.WHY ARE YOU LYING. STOP FUCKING LYING, WOMAN. STOP. LYING.Yes, she'd loved Sam—more than she'd ever loved anyone. Even Chaol.BITCH DON'T MAKE ME SLAP YOU WITH MY COPY OF CoM.This part, though.Do you understand what it was like for us here? While you were off playing with magic, off gallivanting with your faerie prince, do you understand what happened to me—to Dorian?WHERE'S THE LIE.#ChaolspeaksthetruthRowan/Aelin should have stayed platonic.InHeir of Firethey repeatedly told us that there was absolutely nothing romantic in their relationship, but in this book they acted like lovers in a erotic novel. It was pathetic.Rowan treated Celaena like hell in the previous book: he told her she was useless, that she would be better off dead; but nowthey're so suddenly in lovewith each other and it's all over their heads.And I wonder how they went from friends to lovers in such a small amount of time.Aelin would wear a dress with nothing underneath, and Rowan would take it as a huge turn on. She would freak out thinking too much about her incredibly handsome male partner that I wanted to punch my head against a wall.Several times.Their relationship is not healthy at all,SHE LITERALLY OWNS HIM.And every five seconds Aelin would come up with things like this:A chill fog had blanketed the world the night before, seeping in through every nook and cranny. Nestled under layers of quilts and down blankets,Aelin rolled over in bed and stretched a hand across the mattress, reaching lazily for the warm male body beside hers.I just hope it's a dead body.#sorrynotsorryAfter all that she had endured, after what she had overcome in Wendlyn, to return to this... She wished Rowan were beside her, wished she could smell his pine-and-snow scent and know that no matter what news Arobynn bore,no matter how it shattered her, the Fae warrior would be there to help put the pieces back together.That sounds like the typical\"fix me, I'm broken\"plot we find in every NA book.I know Rowan is hot and has amazing fighting skills and his body's been formed by centuries of war and blah blah blah, but he acted like he was a member of Jersey Shore.Everything was an excuse for him to be shirtless.And the way he and Aedion acted around Aelin WAS THE MOST PATHETIC THING I'VE EVER SEEN. It was like watching a pissing contest.Guys, Celaena made it through three damn books without you. I'm pretty sure Aelin can take care of herself.BACK THE FUCK OFF.Everybody loved Aelin Galathynius.She was beautiful, she was sexy, she was lethal. Rowan and Aedion would fight over her. Arobynn would send her expensive gowns and perfumes. And she was definitely enjoying the attention.Celaena was arrogant, but Aelin reached a whole new level.She did not need the extra strength, speed, and agility of her Fae form to bring down her enemies.Whatever helps you sleep at night, honey.One of the few good things about this book was Dorian and Chaol's friendship (BrOTP af).At this point they're all I care about. I wouldn't mind if they get together and get married and have babies. They're the only two characters I dare save from this mess. Don't fight me on this.Everything—everything was for Dorian, for his friend. For himself, he had nothing left to lose. He was nothing more than a nameless oath-breaker, a liar, a traitor.I love how loyal to Dorian Chaol is. I love how he fought Aelin just to save his Prince. His King. I love how he always believed there was a chance to save him. But I wish they had had a moment at the end of the book, because that is what they deserved.Chaol left with Nesryn, and now Dorian is unprotected again. It just feels off.I would like to talk about Arobynn Hamel, because I thought of him as such a rich and interesting character.I hate that he was lowered to the point of being just another crazy fan of Aelin.In the short novels we got to see a bit about his creepy obsession with Celaena and how far he would go to have her. I believe his characterhad more things to offerthan just that. I was looking forward to reading the epic battle between the Greatest Assassin in Adarlan and the man who trained her, but that didn't happen. Arobynn was a huge threat, and killing him off so soon--without getting his potential to its fullest--was a pretty ugly decision, if you ask me. And what a way to kill the Assassin's King: while he's asleep, by Lysandra.Really, Sarah?! REALLY?!The King was another disappointment.The biggest villain, a monster, the man who had erased magic from the Kingdom.... asking for mercy. The whole being-possessed-by-a-demon plot would have worked out pretty well if only had been thought throught. Why? Because we barely got the King's pov. If you want me to believe he had been struggling with a dark force within him, you must let me know him first--dude, we didn't even know his freaking name!--otherwise I don't care about what happens to him at all.Having Lysandra, The King and Arobynn's POV's in the previous books would have made things a lot interesting and added more depth to the plot.But the author just included them in this book, and honestlythey felt more like mere excuses and subplots.And can we talk about these ridiculously long speeches?Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak Witch-Clan, bearer of the blade Wind-Cleaver, rider of the wyvern Abraxos, and Wing Leader of the King of Adarlan's aerial host, stared at the portly man sitting across the black glass table and kept her temper on a tight leash.She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin\tFireheart, and\tshe bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.Stop acting like you're both Daenerys Targaryen.If you go into my profile, you'll see that Sarah J. Maas has been removed from my list of favorite authors. I cannot believe in the poor excuses she made. Arobynn Hamel getting killed so easily even thoughNo one—not even the King of Adarlan—would be stupid enough to go after him(actual quote); The King of Adarlan being posessed by a demon all this time; Lysandra and Aelin suddenly being BFFs and sharing everything; Lysandra being a shape-shifter (how fucking convenient)... And Manon, I couldn't bring myself to care about this precious character. At All. I got some serious Manon/Dorian vibes, so I guess in the next book there'll be another romantic subplot. The King and his son had such an interesting plot, but sadly Aelin and Rowan's adventures were more important for the sake of the plot.SJMAAS lost me when she decided that Aelin would be ok with killing Dorian.So this is it.The most difficult part is that I now should seeCrown of Midnightas an standalone, because that book is a contradiction to everything I just read fromQueen of Shadows. A fanfic of her own series is what SJM wrote, and it pains me to see how my favorite characters were sacrificed over stupid subplots. It all ended in the second book, I'm afraid. Well--it was good while it lasted, because I already gave up on these books._______________________________________________________Queen of Shadows, a summary:Aelin:Celaena Sardothien is dead, I'm in charge now, and I'll burn everyone who dare say otherwise.Chaol:but WHAT ABOUT DORIANAelin:You left him!! You poor human with no powers couldn't save Dorian nor destroy the King and I hate you!!Chaol:I feel so sorry for myself.Rowan:How you doin'? *takes shirt off*Dorian:♪I was as pure as a river, but now I think I'm possessed♫Aelin:*contemplates killing them all while also saying she's changed*Chaol:but WHAT ABOUT DORIANNesryn:This is too messy, I'm out.Rowan:*breathes*Aelin:omg did you see that? HE. JUST. BREATHED.Manon:*staring at nothing* I...wanna...learn...what...love...isArobynn:Aelin Galathynius is perfect.Lysandra:Aelin Galathynius is perfect.Rowan:Aelin Galathynius is perfect.Aedion:Aelin Galathynius is perfect.Erilea:Aelin Galathynius is perfect.THE WORLD:Aelin Galathynius is perfect.Chaol:She is not my queen.Aelin:OMG how dare you you! I am Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, heir of fire, beloved of Mala Light-Bringer, and rightful Queen of Terrasen, and I have Rowan now.Me:I thought Chaolaena was endgame.Me:WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SECOND BOOK??? CROWN OF MIDNIGHT??? WHAT ABOUT THAT???SJMAAS:I don't know, suddenly I can't read.*If you listen closely you can hear me cry* This was one of my favorite series and now it's ruined."

        "user_review": "Many people know how I have felt about the books of this series. That I enjoyed the light, fluffyThrone of Glass. That I absolutely lovedCrown of Midnight. ThatHeir of Firewas a slow, plodding disappointment.Did I likeQueen of Shadowsmore than its predecessor?Yes.Do I think it's a fantastic book?No.Do I think you should read it? Well, it depends. It depends on whether you are committed enough to this series and these characters to read650 pages of just okay.This book is loooonnnng. I think - objectively - Maas has grown as a writer with every book, developing a complexity and density to her plot that wasn't there in the beginning. But I also think that a lot of the delicious goodness that made me sprint through pages in the first two books has been sucked out.Like other much-loved fantasy greats, her books have become more layered, with other characters, perspectives and side stories existing alongside Aelin/Celaena's story. Though, I personally don't care for many of these characters and I have to force myself not to skim-read through their chapters to get back to the main story.And, to be honest, a whole lot of this huge book (about two thirds) feels like set-up for what is going to happen. Which might be fine until you consider that it is 650 pages long (and really didn't need to be), which means there are about 400 pages of planning, angsting, conversation andobsessing over Aelin.Because that is really starting to get to me. We're about 2000 pages into this series and I honestly don't think I can take any more about how amazing Aelin/Celaena is. Everyone is in love with her. Everyone is in awe of her and her endless ability to do no wrong. Rowan sees her again and has to spend half a page going on about how stunning she is.And the badass speeches that are getting kind of old:She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.The first one or two times this happened, I thought \"Hell yeah!\" but now I'm just like \"Yeah, okay, I get it. She's freaking amazing.\"My favourite thing about this book is Lysandra. Both what Maas has done with her characterization and the way she has developed the complex female friendship between her and Aelin.That was fantastic. But the romantic relationships have also turned sour, for me. My Chaol ship appears to have sunk and I find beautiful Rowan so boring - I have no interest in his relationship with Celaena or how good he is with his tongue.I will read on because I'm too invested in this series to not know what happens, but I am resigned to the very likely probability that this series peaked atCrown of Midnight.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Pinterest"

I made a set of 10 QUEEN OF SHADOWS DIY tattoos you can download for free here:http://www.themidnightgarden.net/2015...There is a giveaway for 2 QOS tote bags + books as well.Kim and I will also be doing a joint review discussion on the blog soon. I'm refraining from responding to further comments on this review space for the time being while I collect my thoughts, but I thank you guys so much for the discussion and passion for these books, and look forward to continuing later. See you back here in a bit, I'll post the link when it's up!Initial reaction:I stayed up all night reading this, and these are the only coherent things I can say at this point:1. The women in this series are PHENOMENAL. Holy hell, I swear fealty to them until the end of my days.2. The new characters are fantastic! There is such complexity and poignancy in each of their stories, and I loved every single one of them, as well as what Aelin's interactions with them showed about her character.3. More descriptions of sleeping under a wyvern's wing, please. <34. I have issues with the way a couple of things are handled--most strongly and specifically, how poor Chaol is almost unrecognizable for most of this book. Even though I can accept misunderstandings, mistakes, differences of opinion, cross-purposes, and so on, it makes me so sad that his story arc seemed to be so diminished and dishonored.5. But the thing I didn't think I could be talked into, I'm actually totally on board with. I get why people might be upset byRowan and Aelin getting together, and maybe if there hadn't been so much previous back and forth with Dorian and Chaol, and if Chaol hadn't pretty much disavowed Aelin through most of this book, the new relationship would've been more palatable, but I'm pretty happy with the way the way the big change develops and is described in and of itself.6. This book also made me cry. Like gasping sobs in the middle of the night that I had to stifle so I wouldn't wake my husband. I teared up at several points, but the graveyard scene was the one where I just lost it.Sam still hurts my heart, so I was unbearably moved that his presence is so deeply felt in this book. I didn't expect it.*bawls all over again*7. Honestly,Dorian and Chaol should just get a room together.Also, the badass action scenes! Aelin! Her suit and weapons! The magic! MANON. And bathtub scenes, heeeey. More at some point when I'm not half-dead with lack of sleep.I went into this with a certain amount of dread, but much to my surprise, this is the book that has the happiest ending out of all of them. This just means more torture is in store in future books, obviously, but for now...bliss.** PLEASE.Use spoiler tags in the commentsbelow if you want to talk about anything that could even remotely spoil the reading experience for someone else. Thank you!"

And I mean it. Now, because I liked this one more than the rest of the other three I've read, I have to give it six stars, right? Problem: I don't have six stars so it is going to get the five and deal with it.This book is a whole journey. And I would love to take you to that journey with me, but I am not even sure that I will be able to hit all the best touristic attractions of it. I'll try though because it is worth it. Really.\"(…) forgive a girl who had needed a captain to be her champion. But she was her own champion now.\"I just love this powerful mind-set Aelin has in this book. She's more focused, more determined and more mature than she's ever been. She empowers herself and others. She knows that. And she knows that she has to be confident in order to make others believe in her. To make them confident.There is also a wave of strength and empowerment among all the characters. This, in my opinion, shows a positive character change, a growth that is wanted, needed and achievable.\"I will keep getting back up, no matter how many times those butchers shove me down.\"Also, apart from all this beautiful feeling of empowerment, there is a deep feeling ofloveandloyaltyin this book. And don't tell me this type of feeling is not comforting and reassuring because I don't believe you. Love is not only a singular thing; it can come in so many beautiful other ways and forms. And you know when you come across them. You sense them. And this book isfullof them.\"She looked at them, at the three males who meant everything – more than everything. Then she smiled with every last shred of courage, of desperation, of hope for the glimmer of that glorious future.\"Let's go rattle the stars\" \" .Aelin's relationship with the other characters has developed a lot too. Giving the fact that she's more mature and has a grown-up thinking now, her interactions with the other characters are changed in a remarkable way – her old friends are still her old friends and she's ready to give them her friendship in exchange for their loyalty. Her new acquaintances though are caught off guard by the way this young queen feels appropriate to act around them.All I'd really like everyone to notice in this book (and then I leave y'all alone) is the character growth I was talking about earlier (yeah, I know I've repeated myself already but that is a very important track to follow throughout the book in order to notice its essence). And, I don't know if this is coming from me or it is the whole idea of the book, but I think this character development is based on this level of love SJM has inserted in a fair amount. And the idea behind this is that everything that is made with love is becoming beautiful – it is growing and it is blooming. And even the darkest souls might have a secret desire of love somewhere hidden, even though it is hard to reach."

Without it, a kingdom is nothing, and will be forgotten by time.\"If you read any of my updates I'm sure you'll already know how I feel about this book. To say it was better than its predecessors would probably be the understatement of the century so all I'll say is that Sarah once again surpassed herself. <3There were so many new characters that got introduced during the book and I'm not lying when I say that I loved them all. XD I think one of the most amazing things about Sarah's books is that she has so many awesome and strong heroines! They do what they want to do, they are brave, they dare to dream, they dare to hope and they always make their way! It's just so amazing to read! =)))Of course not everything in\"Queen of Shadows\"is sunshine though and boy did it hit me with the feels sometimes! There were actually moments I was so frustrated that I felt like tearing the book apart (Don't worry I did no such thing, I love my books too much to harm them. *lol*) and there were some chapters that killed me over and over again. I guess by now you all know which chapters I'm talking about. ;-)Well anyway, let's not talk about the epic fights or the hopeful ending.WHAT a hopeful ending? YES!!!Jeez, I think this must be the first time I'm not destroyed after one of Sarah's books. I'm actually h- … hopeful! I'm not licking my wounds or trying to deal with my emotions so knowing Sarah I have absolutely no doubt that she's going to destroy me with\"Empire of Storms\".Ladies and Gentleman, this is the quiet before the storm and I'm so not ready for it! XD Which is probably the main reason I'm writing this review. I'm trying to stall for time. *lol* #SorryNotSorryThe characters:Spoiler warning! My character section is so full of spoilers you won't even have to read the book anymore. ;-P So if you still want to read this series and want to experience it all by yourself you better stop reading now! Don't say I didn't warn you! XDAelin:\"How can I take away somebody who means the world to someone else? Even if she's my enemy.\"Boy, did I have mixed feelings about Aelin in this book! On the one hand I really loved her and could understand her decisions, but on the other hand all I wanted to do was to yell at her! *lol* I mean she sometimes really didn't make it easy to like her in this book, knowing about her past and everything she's been through I could see through her façade though. I mean it's obvious she struggled with her new role as Queen and because of her insecurities and fears she sometimes made mistakes that got her into trouble. A crown is a heavy weight; I don't blame her for not being perfect. Hell, I'm pretty sure I would have made plenty of mistakes as well. XD\"But now that she was here … everything was an effort not to say she was sorry. Sorry not for what she'd done to his face, but for the fact that her heart was healed – still fractured in spots, but healed – and he … he was not in it. Not as he'd once been.\"Chaol:\"Magic has saved your life a few times now, if I recall correctly.\"\"Yes,\" he breathed, \"you and Dorian both – and I'm grateful, I am. But where are the checks against your kind? Iron? Not much of a deterrent, is it? Once magic is free, who is to stop the monsters from coming out again? Who is to stop you?\"And here is my second problem child! Chaol! Jeez, he said quite some nasty stuff! I mean I know where he's coming from and I understand that he worries for his people and kingdom; I'm not okay with what he said about magic though. Before you go all like: \"Oh don't you dare to say anything against my baby!\" now *raises eyebrow and looks at Gem and J.* I'll tell you that despite all this I actually still love him. *lol* He did the best he could do and he's just human. Of course he is afraid of magic and what it might do to his kingdom. I mean in spite of being the former captain of the king's guard he's still young. I'm sure he can't even remember the world with magic and it's no surprise he's afraid of it. If he proved anything over those last 4 books then it is that he's able to learn and to change though. So yes, I have faith in him and I'm sure as long as he follows his heart, he'll always do the right thing. Plus:WHY DID YOU HAVE TO HURT HIM LIKE THAT, SARAH?!I think Chaol suffered enough over those last few books and now this too?! Not fair. T_TDorian:\"He deserved this darkness, and once the invisible boundary shattered and the waiting thing pounced, infiltrating and filling him … he'd have earned it.\"MY PRECIOUS CINNAMON ROLL!!!*sobs* Gosh, how much did I suffer with him, how much did I weep for his shattered and broken soul. The pain he went through, the torture he had to endure. T_T Every chapter was another stab into my heart and by the end of the book I almost lost hope that he'd be free again. I thought he was going to die, that nothing would be left of him, but then, then he broke his chains and OMG did I cry when he finally escaped!!! Still, he's so broken and lonely and I'm not sure how he's going to deal with everything that happened to him. I'm so worried about Dorian and I really hope he'll be able to find happiness!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333\"There were tears running down Aelin's face as Dorian gripped the black stone encircling his throat. And bellowing his grief, his rage, his pain, he snapped the collar from his neck.\"\"The sun would still rise and fall, the seasons would still change, heedless of whether he was free or enslaved, prince or king, heedless of who was alive and who was gone. The world would keep moving on. It didn't seem right, somehow.\"Manon:\"I'm not in the habit of forcing my servants.\"\"Only slaughtering men like pigs, correct?\"\"Their deaths equate to their behavior in life,\" Manon replied with a kind of calm that made Elide wonder whether she should start running.Ahh Manon! My sexy relentless, fierce and ruthless witch! I love her! She's one of those characters I can't help but adore! I know she isn't really a heroine, but she certainly is no villain either. In fact she's such a complex character that I just can't get enough of her!I FREAKIN LOVE THIS WITCH!And I'm so damn glad she finally decided to do whatSHEthinks is right! YESH!!! Screw that old hag of a matron and do your thing Manon! Because you're amazing and you could be so much more than just the monster others see in you! It's time to disobey orders and to kick asses! Show them your iron fangs, baby! XD #GuessImTeamManonNowTooAsterin let out another joyless laugh. \"You would not have disobeyed even if it had been Blackbeaks down there, would you? Loyalty, obedience, brutality – that is what you are.\"\"Do you believe monsters are born, or made?\"Rowan:\"You will make mistakes. You will make decisions, and sometimes you will regret those choices. Sometimes there won't be a right choice, just the best of several bad options. I don't need to tell you that you can do this – you know you can. I wouldn't have sworn the oath to you if I didn't think you could.\"I like Rowan but despite him becoming the main love interest for Aelin I still don't love him as much as I love Dorian or Aedion. Hmm.. I dunno what it is but I think I'm kind of unhappy with his development. I mean in \"Heir of Fire\" he was this kickass, broody and fierce warrior that took no shit and now he's almost become a purring kitty in Aelin's arms. I mean I do get that he loves Aelin and would do everything for her, but I think his love for her made him less interesting somehow? Idk. It's like he lost some part of himself now that he fell in love with his Queen and I really hope we'll see the fierce warrior in \"Empire of Storms\" again. Please?Aedion:\"Whatever you had to do to survive, whatever you did from spite or rage or selfishness … I don't give a damn. You're here – and you're perfect. You always were, and you always will be.\"AEDION IS MY CUPCAKE!Seriously I think he's one of the cutest guys ever and he definitely deserves the world! I love how fiercely loyal he is and that he always tries to see the good in people. He never wavered and he always did the right thing, even if it hurt him and was at his own expense. Like for instance accepting that Aelin let Rowan take the oath and didn't even mention it! Gosh darn it! Aedion deserved better than that! I'll personally pull Aelin's long fae ears if she ever hurts him like that again!! Also is Aedion bi? I mean he commented on Rowan being handsome so I think that actually might be a possibility! Just one more reason to love him! <333Lysandra:\"No. And what kills me is that I can't remember what my real face was. That was the danger of shifting – that you would forget your real form, because it's the memory of it that guides the shifting. I remember being plain as a dormouse, but … I don't remember if my eyes were blue or gray or green; I can't remember the shape of my nose or my chin. And it was a child's body, too. I don't know what I would look like now, as a woman.\"I'm in love with Lysandra too! *lol* Yes, I can't help it! She's such an awesome woman as well and she's a hell of a fighter! Gosh did I love her comments! That girl brought so much life into Aelin's court and I lived for her remarks. She always tried to appear nonchalant and bitchy but deep down within her there's a heart of gold and by the end of the book even Aelin was able to see it. To think they were enemies and rivals once... I'm so glad they finally became friends. Plus: How cool is it that Lysandra is a shape shifter?!! I mean OMG!!! I didn't expect that and I was so surprised when I found out. XD\"The soldiers in the sewer were screaming as she tore into them – a death for every day in hell, a death for the childhood taken from her and from Evangeline. She was fury, she was wrath, she was vengeance.\"Elide & Nesryn:\"You told me Dorian would fix the world, make it better. Buf if he's gone, if we made the mistake today in keeping him alive, then I will find another way to attain that future. And another one after that, if I have to. I will keep getting back up, no matter how many times those butchers shove me down.\"- NesrynThose two were both strong women in their own way, but I feel like we didn't get to see all too much of them. I just wish there would have been more scenes with Elide & Nesryn. I mean they both intrigued me and their characters sounded very interesting, in the end I don't feel like I really got to know them though. *sigh* Well, there are so many characters in Sarah's books, it's no wonder some of them fall by the wayside. Let's hope there will be more of them in Eos! ;-)Arobynn:\"Sam had been tortured in ways she hadn't even known until she read Wesley's letter. The worst of it had been requested by Arobynn. Requested, as punishment for Sam's loving her – punishment for tampering with Arobynn's belongings.\"That manipulative jerk eventually got what he deserved! But damn I wish it wouldn't have happened the way it did in the end. To die in his sleep was a death too merciful for him. For all the horrible and atrocious things Arobynn did he should have at least been awake and aware of the fact that he died. I understand why Lysandra could only kill him in his sleep though. *sigh* My poor brave girl!The friendships & ships:Aelin & Chaol:For a heartbeat, she pitied him, and part of her wished she could say it more kindly, more compassionately. \"There's no getting Dorian out. There's no saving him.\"\"Like hell there isn't.\"THOSE TWO!Gosh, they constantly seemed to be at each other's throat and they frustrated me immensely! I hated that Aelin thought she couldn't save Dorian and loved Chaol for never giving up on him, yet at the same time I disliked Chaol for calling Aelin a monster! I swear their anger and the way they treated each other had me all like:No, NO, NO! You're supposed to help each other!! You're supposed to save Dorian! Pull yourself together and work it out! GODDAMMIT!!!Thankfully by the end of the book both of them finally realized that they need each other and they eventually made amends. Jeez! It was about time! *sighs deeply* Urgh they were so stressful.\"We do not look back, Chaol. It helps no one and nothing to look back. We can only go on.\"There she was, that queen looking out at him, a hint of the ruler she was becoming. And it knocked the breath out of him, because it made him feel so strangely young – when she now seemed so old.Rowan & Aelin:\"I could still probably braid this,\" she mused. \"Very teensy-tiny braids, so – \" He growled, but leaned back against the tub, his eyes closed. \"You're no better than a house cat,\" she said, massaging his head. He let out a low noise in his throat that might very well have been a purr.Haha! I loved it when Rowan lost all common sense at seeing Aelin in a flimsy nightgown! *LOL* Such a mighty fae warrior and then he sees her like that and isn't even capable to utter a single word. XD Fun times. ;-P Still, I really like their connection and that they are so close to each other, I kind of dislike the notion of Rowan disappearing as an individual though. I just hope that he'll give her hell in \"EoS\" again. *lol* Because I lived for their easy banter and the fact that they always gave each other a run for their money! XD It would be boring if Rowan would end up as nothing more than the man at Aelin's side.\"I spent centuries wandering the world, from empires to kingdoms to wastelands, never settling, never stopping – not for one moment. I was always looking toward the horizon, always wondering what waited across the next ocean, over the next mountain. But I think … I think that whole time, all those centuries, I was just looking for you.\"Manon & Dorian:He cocked his head. \"I've never been with a witch.\"Let her rip out his throat for that. End it.A row of iron fangs snapped down over her teeth as her smile grew. \"I've been with plenty of men. You're all the same. Taste the same.\" She looked him over as if he were her next meal.\"I dare you,\" he managed to say.Her eyes narrowed, the gold like living embers. He'd never seen anyone so beautiful. This witch had been crafted from the darkness between the stars.I SHIP THEM SO HARD I CAN'T EVEN!!!! ADKFADSFASDJFKSDFJA!I love it that Manon was the only one who got that Dorian is still alive and I love that she was so drawn to him! And boy those two short conversations they had!THEY GAVE ME LIFE!!! I WANT MORE OF THEM!!Just more!! I want my fierce, ruthless witch and my precious cinnamon roll to be together!!! PLEASEEEEE!!!! *dies out of sheer excitement*\"And through the darkness of his memories, through the pain and despair and terror he'd tried to forget, a name echoed in his head.\"Manon & Asterin:\"That wildness, that untamed fierceness … They weren't born of a free heart, but of one that had known despair so complete that living brightly, living violently, was the only way to outrun it.\"Asterin's story broke my heart and I want her to be happy again!!! I hated it so much that they both were at odds with each other and that Asterin had to suffer so much even though she only wanted to help Manon. She loves her. It's more than just obvious! As it seems Manon had to come a long way until she realized what truly matters, but I think now that she did, she's finally ready to oppose her matron! I really can't wait to seeTHATfight! XD\"Things are changing,\" Manon said.\"Good,\" Asterin said. \"We're immortals. Things should change, and often, or they'll get boring.\"Manon lifted her brows, and her Second grinnend. Manon shook her head and grinned back.Lysandra & Aedion:A strange, ever-changing female scent hit him, and Aedion found Lysandra leaning against the hallway door. Tears gleamed in her eyes even as she smiled.She gazed at the closed bedroom door, as if she could still see the prince and queen inside. \"That,\" she said, more to herself than to him. \"That is what I am going to find one day.\"\"A gorgeous Fae warrior?\" Aedion said, shifting a bit.Lysandra chuckled, wiping away her tears, and gave him a knowing look before walking away.Another ship I want to sail! I think Aedion and Lysandra would make such a great couple! *lol* Besides I'm sure Lysandra might actually be the only one who would be able to keep up with Aedion. Haha! I mean they tease each other so nicely and Aedion is even slightly unsettled when she's turning into a ghost leopard which means he has a lot of respect for her and this is always important in a relationship! =) Let's see if Aedion will be Lysandra's gorgeous Fae warrior in '\"Eos\"! ;-PAelin & Dorian:\"It is going to take a while. And it might never be right again. Buy you …\" She gripped his hand, as if he hadn't used those hands to hurt and maim, to stab her. \"You will learn to face it, and to endure it. What happened, Dorian, was not your fault.\"I still love their strong friendship, despite Aelin being willing to kill him of course. XD But I guess after meeting those Valg Princes at Wendlyn she was allowed to doubt his survival. Still, they both can change the world together and they are both so strong! I have faith in them and I'm sure if they help each other and stick together they can really shatter the chains of their world and make it right! =)Dorian & Chaol:\"I didn't realize I looked that bad,\" Dorian said, his voice raw.He knew then – that the demon inside the prince was gone. Chaol wept.Dorian surged from the chair and dropped to his knees beside the bed. He grabbed Chaol's hand, squeezing it as he pressed his brow against his. \"You were dead,\" the prince said, his voice breaking. \"I thought you were dead.\"Those two had me in tears at the end. T_T I was so happy they both found each other again!!! Their friendship went through so much in those last four books and now they are finally together! I love them and I admit it, I even kinda ship them. XD I mean hello, Chaol told Dorian that heloveshim! XD Can't blame me for shipping them, can you?! ;-P Besides, it's obvious they love each other. At least as friends they do. XDAll told I really loved\"Queen of Shadows\"and I can't wait to get to book five! I'm sure Sarah will have a lot in store for us and I'm kinda scared to start it. As long as myprecious Gemcontinues this journey with me I shall be fine though! ;-P Thanks for reading this series with me! XD We just have to read two more books!!! Two more books Gem and we'll be ready to read\"Kingdom of Ash\". =)"

She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.I honestly cannot remember the last time when aseries was so consistently good.It's the fourth book and yet the story and the characters feel as fresh as the first.Aelin Galathynius has returned and her life as Celaena Sardothien is a part of the past -or so she thought.

        "user_review": "Post-reading: WOW. No words for this book. 95% love for this book, but the first 300 pages had issues I can't deny. But overall I just love love love how the plot developed!Full review:Check out my review @A Perfection Called Books**Spoilers from previous books. Slight QoS spoilers about romance.Throne of Glass has been one of my favorite series for a few years now, so I've been impatiently waiting for Queen of Shadows and building the expectations to the highest degree. The fourth installment wowed me yet had some flaws I can't ignore.As much as I'd like to blindly give myself over to the epicness of this series and say \"It was perfect, and everything was amazing\" I can't do that as a reviewer. Nor can I do that as a reader/person in general. I refuse to trick myself! Overall though, I have so many positive things to say about this book,and a few negative things to discuss.The PlotFirst let's start with the plot development. I bow down to Sarah J Maas and her brilliant plotting. I am astounded by all the ties and connections reaching so far back to The Assassin's Blade. There are lots of ah-ha and mind-blowing moments. Everything connects in some way, and Maas is a magnificent plotter. The pacing was a bit slow for the first 300 pages, but there's so much plot build-up and development that keeps us engaged. Maas' writing has progressively matured into a beautiful story-telling talent. There's an ominous edge to it that perfectly matches the tone of the series. I feel this series is getting darker and darker; it's often pitched as a less promiscuous YA Game of Thrones. There are some bloody scenes, lots of death, and quite a bit of pain. Action is interspersed throughout the story too.The CharactersLet's talk about the characters! In Heir of Fire, I had a few issues with the various POV switches, but I thought the transitions were smoother in Queen of Shadows, and I actually like Manon and her story a bit more in this book. Elide is also introduced, and while her POV was my least favorite, her character is pretty tenacious and smart, so I can't wait to see where she goes next. Lysandra is re-introduced, and I love her sassy and snarky character. Nesyrn is a rebel who is part of the city guard. She's pretty stoic and strong-willed, and I like her! Aedion will always be a bright star with his unending devotion and loyalty to Aelin. Dorian's character and POVs were painful and sad to read. I love him and thought his tenacity and decisiveness were admirable.Squad assembled in this book, and I was so happy about that!! I love Aelin's court/group and seeing them all come together was definitely one of my favorite parts. Light banter and strong female friendships prevail, and I approve! Arobynn comes back into this novel and oh geez I forgot how cynical and ruthless he is. Sam has such a presence in this novel which was equal parts surprising, somber, and up-lifting.Let's talk about Rowan, Chaol, and Aelin. Such fun. While I loved all the other characters mentioned above, I had so much trouble with these three. Please don't stone me, but I'm going to call BS and say these people were SO out of character for the first 300 pages. I liked Rowan a bit better in this book, but whoa has he changed. No longer is he the tight***, brutal and unemotional warrior. He's now reduced to a horny teenager who pines over Aelin. I failed to see many similarities between this Rowan and the one from HoF. Chaol, oh my sweet Chaol. Honorable Captain of the Guard, now disgraced and rebel-turned. His bitterness has reached his peak just as his character and his POV has been diminished. I still hold on to the hope he'll achieve redemption. Chaol has grown so much throughout this series, yet he still needs time to grow. He's used to his beliefs and blindly and honorably follows his king. Now that everything he knows and loves is being threatened and challenged, he's had to change, and not everyone reacts the same way to change. He's made progress!Aelin has turned malicious and bitter. I love how bad*** she is and how she fights for what she believes in, but I missed her sarcastic nature. I missed the girl who loved reading and dresses yet also loved to show people her girl power and how awesome she is. She lacked the confidence and humor I associate with her. Just because she and Celaena have different goals, I don't think that should mean her character takes a 180 turn. Most of all Aelin is highly hypocritical, especially towards Chaol. Aelin and Chaol are both mad at each other for both reasonable and unreasonable things. Personally I think they were both being hypocritical as they slung insults and accusations at each other at their first meeting in QoS. I see faults on both sides, but I think they'll work through it eventually.The RomanceSpeaking of Aelin and Chaol, you've probably heard about the romance news. I'll be honest, this ship is sunk and blasted to smithereens. They want and need different things, and it would never work out. It twinges my heart and makes me wonder about the so-called significance of the words exchanged on Crown of Midnight. Some things literally do NOT make sense. Aelin even says something to the effect of \"Even though I said I'd always pick you, I didn't mean I'd actually always pick you.\" I feel like books 1 and 2 were so insignificance and fake now in regards to the romance. I think it's fresh and unique to see how realistic the portrayal of falling into and out of love is, but it still hurts. I feel like we were led on in Crown of Midnight, and you can't deny all the words they said to each other.Jumping to the romance, I do not understand it nor will I get on board with it. I'm not being a stubborn Chaolaena shipper (okay maybe a little bit), but I fail to see Rowaelin in the long run. Rowan is the type of guy Aelin needs right now. I just don't understand how things progressed from Heir of Fire as a platonic friendship to a lusty and yearning attachment in Queen of Shadows. I feel like I missed an extra novella or something. Rowan had his one true mate AND is three hundred years old. This romance does not compute. That being said, there actually isn't much romance in this book, it's more promises to come in the next book.As Cait from Paper Fury pointed out, there are so many conveniences in the romance department. Nesryn will take Celaena's place in Chaol's heart, so Aelin and Rowan can be happy together, and everything is all sparkly rainbows and wonderful now. I feel like this is such an easy way out. The Chaolin breakup was brutal, and I'm sad to see how it wrecked their friendship too.The last 150 pages of the book are insanely epic and wonderful. The characters grow into their own a bit more as well.Overall the amazing plot, squad assemblage, and writing make this book wonderful while the romance and earlier portrayal of the characters sorely disappointed and confused me.Update 5/22/15Queen of Shadows is 672 pages long. *sinks in*OH MY GOSH I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!!!!!Update 3/10/14LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL COVERAhhh, she's so badass!! AND SHE'S GOT THE SWORD!! She's ready to take back her crown, all hail Queen Aelin!!!! Bwhaha a red cover means action and blood to come, right?

        "user_review": "01/28/16Everyone is lowering their 2-stars rating to one star, and tbh I completely agree, this is not worth two stars.***times I broke down and cried: 5times I screamed and cussed at the book: 38fucks I give about this series right now: 0Let's start this review a bit different. Let's think of an alternative title for it… how about… I don't know…\"HOW TO RUIN A CHARACTER AND HIS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH 3 MOTHERFUCKING BOOKS IN ONE BOOK\". Yep, that fits perfectly!This is not a proper review, it's more of an incomprehensible rant with a lot of cursing.Those who saw my updates already know how torn I am about this book. It's still so difficult for me to form an opinion, because this book was such a mix of an amazing plot-line and ass-kicking and just real bullshit.About the amazing plot-line, well, Sarah J. Maas comes up with the most mind-blowing plot-twists. The ass-kicking: well-choreographed fights and Aelin's plans were just brilliant. And I love Sarah's writing style, it kicks me right in the feels every damn time.Now, so far it sounds pretty good, right? You may ask, why the 2-stars-rating then?There's one thing that ruined everything.The Chaol thing.First you have to know that I love Chaol with all my heart.#chaoldefensesquadFrom book one he was my favourite character and his development through the first three books just blew me away. He is definitely flawed, but who is not.So the way Sarah handled his character in QOS just broke my heart. She destroyed all his development in 60 pages. That's right, she threw away all the work she put into him in less than 9% of the book.This just felt like such a slap in the face. The way she wrote Chaol in the first 70% was so out of character. It wasn't even Chaol anymore, the Chaol I know and read about would never act the way he did.You may say that he's Sarah's character, she wrote him and probably knows him the best. Do I have any right to say he was out of characters? Maybe not. But I was madly obsessed with him from the start, over-analysed every word he said and action he made. I dare to say that I know him enough to say that QOS Chaol was just bullshit.Do I sound like a child throwing a tantrum? Maybe. But you know what? I. Don't. Care.How could someone put so much effort into developing a character, and then just destroy him and waste all the potential?It makes no fucking sense. It's stupid. So stupid.But there is an explanation, well, my explanation.Rowan.I already knew about Sarah's obsession with Rowan; every interview I watched she ended up speaking about him and how hot he is. So often she didn't even mention the other characters.I'm not complaining, he definitely is an interesting character and I like him.But when an author rewrites a character (Chaol) just to benefit another one (Rowan), I can't help but feel betrayed.It was like the first two books didn't even happen to Chaol, we started from zero again. And I'm just so angry.When the conversation at page 60 happened I just broke down and cried. I couldn't believe that this was happening. This was not Chaol, not the guy who was ready to give up everything he worked for and ever believed in to send the girl he loves away to keep her safe.This was just a twisted version of him and honestly, I can't believe Sarah actually came up with this.I FUCKING TRUSTED YOU.Chaol deserves so much better.And the worst thing is, there is no way back from this. No way to fix it. While Sarah did kind of tried to in the end, I still can't forget this whole bullshit she put me, us Chaol fan, through. She just stabbed us and let us bleeding for some hours, then came back and gave us a band-aid for the wound.THAT WON'T FUCKING WORK.I'm also a Chaol/Aelin shipper. I've been since the first couple of chapters of TOG, still am after QOS and will probably always be.But I knew since HOF that they will not be endgame. And I came to terms with it. I was ready for them to end romantically, but I wasn't expecting this shit.Here then comes the second problem, Rowan and Nesryn.Don't hit me, but I shipped Aelin/Rowan after HOF. They made sense to me. But the way Sarah handled their relationship in QOS just weirded me out.Rowan's POVs were sometimes… dumb. I can't find the right word for it, but they made me roll my eyes so often. I still like him, but not as much as I did in HOF.I also didn't like how fast their relationship progressed. Because in HOF they were just friends, it was one of my favourite platonic relationships, and then in QOS they went from 0 to 100. It was just too fast and kind of weird.Then Nesryn. Oh, how much I actually love her. She's such a strong and amazing character. But the way she was introduced ruined it all. It was as if she was just there so Chaol would have someoneyes, she's his new love interest.kill meto talk to. She didn't seem like a character who was planned from the start, but just thrown in when Sarah's startedruiningrewriting Chaol.There's something really wrong about how Sarah just cast him aside for Rowan. It's rude as fuck. It ruined the whole book for me, I couldn't enjoy the first 60% because of it. I mean, how could I, hewasis my favourite character.But there were definitely some parts I still loved about the book.a)Manon. Oh my god guys, her chapters were pure awesomeness. Sometimes they were way more interesting than Aelin's. Her plot-line in this book is just so captivating and I fell in love with her.b)Elide. Damn, her chapters kind of broke my heart but I admire her so much. I don't know about you but I love her so much.c)Dorian. My baby. I'm so scared for you. His chapters were so twisted and dark, but I couldn't help but enjoy them.d)Lysandra. Such a cutie. I loved her relationship with Aelin. BROTP FOREVER.Here's the end of my rant. There are probably more things I wanted to talk about but can't think of right now."

        "user_review": "2.5 stars...Okay okay okay so... THIS BOOK. I'm so conflicted, I hated half of the things that happened but loved the other half! I was going to let myself give it 5 stars just for the AWESOME ending (overall the whole second part of the book was AMAZING), but the first part was unbearable! I believe it took me one week to finish it, while the second part I read it only in one day because OMGITWASSOAMAZING and I couldn't stop. BUT YES, the first part: BORING and ANNOYING. There are so many pages in this book and I don't feel they were necessary, also, I wanted to punch everyone.Another thing that I hated was what SJM did to my babies: CHAOL AND DORIAN. Especially to Chaol, he was so OoC most of the time! AND YES, I was a Chaolena shipper, (WAS, because that ship SUNK in this book and I'm so mad and sad and torn), but I wouldn't be as mad if SJM hadn't RUINED the character. She also ruined Chaolena's dynamics, she made them almost hate each other! At the end of the book everything is kinda better between them, but it will never be the same. So goodbye to my beautiful ship. Chaol didn't deserve what SJM did to him. And about Dorian... he wasn't in enough pages of this book. He was barely there (OH BUT AT THE END HE WAS SO AWESOME, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH).I'm not really fond of the whole Rowan/Aelin thing. I MEAN, I love Rowan, I really do! But what I liked about them was their friendship! It's really hard to find something like that in a YA book and I loved it, BUT THEN in this book they are suddenly all in love with each other, it doesn't make any sense! I can accept them together, I know I can, but SJM could have done a better job in making them fall in love with each other slowly, so WE the readers could notice the change! It was so abrupt! And I was so tired of hearing them saying how stunning and perfect the other was. Bleh. And tbh, they mostly wanted to undress each other in every scene they had together.SO... SHIPS I'M NOT ON BOARD:- Rowan/Aelin: I think they can convince me, but right now I'm a little icky towards them.- Chaol/Nesryn: I like Nesryn as a character, but SJM just put her in the book so Chaol could have a new couple, and it felt forced.MY NEW SHIPS:- Dorian/Manon: OOPS, am I the only one who ships them!? I mean, they surely can become a thing! The few encounters they had were some of the best parts of the book! And Dorian remembers her and FKDKDKGKGA. I don't wanna say much because SPOILERS, but yes, Dorian and Manon would be a powerful and really interesting couple.- Dorian/Chaol: YES I SHIP THEM. Can they get married, like, right now?And yeah... that's basically it. I just want to say that I absolutely LOVED the second part of the book. I couldn't stop reading! Dorian, Manon and Aelin are my heroes! GO, them!...EDIT: Just to add the thing I hate the most about this series! I absolutely HATE that EVERYONE IS SO IN LOVE WITH AELIN. Not just in this book, but in the WHOLE SERIES! Since book one! Sam, Chaol, Dorian, Arobynn, Aedeon, Rowan, even Lysandra... at some point of the series they have marveled at how stunning and beautiful and amazing Celaena/Aelin is, and I can't stand it! I mean, yeah she's awesome, I get it, but it's so unrealistic. Every male she befriends has to fall in love with her :/."

I've read and reread this series to death and will continue to do so till I'm greying.It's a series that's brought me a lot of comfort, it's been a safe space for me for a while.I can't say much without spoiling everything. This 4th instalment was epic The world and the characters get bigger and bigger and better. More expansive, richer. That ending bordered on poetic. It was so hopeful but also highlighting that it's very much the start of a new road for our characters and there'll be many more challenges that they'll have to face.I'm just excited to re-experience the rest of the books. Especially Kingdom of Ash."

The real fight starts now.\"They joined hands.So the world ended.And the next one began.\"By the Wyrd,Sarah J Maas's storytelling is spectacular! I lost two nights' sleep and I forgot to eat because I was sucked in Erilea, sucked in battles and plots and plans that went wrong and sacrifices and generalbadassery. An emotional roller coaster, a wild ride, an incredibly vivid and captivating book. That's what we callhigh fantasypeople.The charactersI can't help but admire Sarah's characters. It's true, Celaena is not someone I can relate to nor agree with, and I found myself scolding her for her decisions and cringing at her cruelty, but at the same time I felt a wave of pride for what she's achieved and the way she has grown up. And the rest of the women oh.my.god!! I freaking love Manon, my brilliant bloodthirsty witch, and Lysandra and Nesryn, they're the embodiment of strength and courage! And they kick ass!As for the men in this book?Dorian is and always will be my favorite, my number one, my precious prince, my baby, my sun and stars, my chocolate cupcake, but Aedion and Rowan and Chaol are also perfect. Andedible. I'm a big fat slut.EmotionsEvery time Dorian was in pain, my heart broke. Every time Sam was mentioned, my heart broke. Every time a story full of pain was revealed, my heart broke.But then Aedion would say something funny and I would be likeThe romanceLet me make something clear. The new ship?Ahoy mates, I'm on board!BUT, I didn't like the way Sarah handled the Chaol/Celaena relationship. I actually felt bad for Chaol and thought that he was right most of the times he and Celaena argued. They all have changed, him and Celaena (and Dorian for that matter), they're not the people we met in the first book, and that's expected. I just wish some changes were smoother.However, this book wasepic. Period. The different storylines were knit together perfectly, and the last 100 pages gave me goosebumps. Like I said, epic.You haven't read it yet? Shame on you!(just kidding, but please go read it!)"

        "user_review": "\"Welcome to the Blackbeaks.\"This series keeps surprising me. I loved how improved the third books was, but this fourth books was well beyond my wildest expectations. Plot, world building, character development, adventure, humor, politics, and anything else you could think of, each reaches a near perfect level in Queen of Shadows. As always, the first half build-up leads to a thrilling second half, that felt more like the final book of a series, than one of the middle installments. I'm having a hard time imagining remaining ones surpassing this book: Maas does everything correctly here. If you're one of many who gave up on this series because of the first two books, you are missing out on an amazing journey.\"Celaena Sardothien doesn't exist anymore.\"While we still have most of the original gang, the author keeps on introducing new, interesting characters with each book. And the best thing is, all these new characters are turning out to be even better than the main ones. Manon and Rowan quickly replaced everyone else as my favorites by the end of this book, and I'm really hoping Maas would not kill them off in near future. When she must have chaos -which would be inevitable in next three books- I'm willing to loose one of the older main characters instead of those two. But I might be getting ahead of myself.Plot-wise, there's a lot happening here. Pretty much all the loose threads are tied up by the end of this book. If it wasn't for a couple of major bad guys remaining, it's easier to imagine this book turning out to be the end of the series. The last quarter was so eventful, and unpredictable, leading up to probably the best ending I've encountered in this series so far. I'm also finding those adventure elements to be quite enjoyable, adding a nice bit of variety to the usual flow with politics, scheming and romance.\"Backs straight, shoulders back, necks uplifted. You are light you are air, you are grace.\"It's not easy to give a 'right' ending to a book like this. If everything goes perfectly, you end up making the ending unrealistic, or make things go very badly by killing some of the good guys, you end up depressing and disappointing a lot of readers. Even though the ending here was a little towards the former, I liked how things turned out at the end. It's really nice of Maas to maintain a perfect balance between victory and defeat without major causalities to the good guys. Though, it's possible that this might be the only happy ending we'll have for a while. 4.5 stars. I'm loving this series!\"And at long last, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius was home.\""

        "user_review": "I loved this book. The books in this series just seem to get bigger and better. This book is 600 + pages, but every page is good and well done. My only complaint is that I would have like more details about the fights, more blow for blow account not that \"they were already carrion, when she drew her blades\". True, this would probably take the page count well into the 1000s, but I would not mind if it was well written as the rest of the book. I have always been a fan of Sarah J Maas' \"chunking\" writing style, where she makes some chapters longer as events dictate in some cases half a page for a side event constitutes a chapter.The last book Celaena's true name and heritage was revealed in this book to reflect this she is referred to as Aelin rather than Celaena, the book also introduced a new character and Manon of the Iron Teeth witches. She and her coven are continued to be developed in this book. For this development and even by the end of the book, we are not sure which way she will turn. Many of the characters of the novellas or the collected counterpart Assassin's Blade paperback. The fallout from there is death within the first half of this book. The body count is higher in this book, but there are not as many fights described. What this book does display is Celaena/Aelin's tactical and planning precision yes she can be a hellcat and a hot head, but as wild as she get she is a disciplined and dangerous fighter always thinking a couple of moves ahead. There is a great cat and mouse game between Aelin and her former master.Aelin returns to Adarlan she finds it an even more brutal place than before. Along with her own vengeance, she must deal with the fallout from the months she has been missing, one disadvantage is all the training she did to hone her powers in the last book, is lost as magic does not work in Adarlan. However, her physical training is still useful and has made her even more formidable. She has embraced her heritage of the Queen (I have to say I love the title of the \"Fire breathing bitch Queen\"), now she must assemble her court. This is big book with big time ramifications and revelations. All in all great."

Celaena is coming for everything they said she couldn't have.Game of ThronesmeetsBatman. That's what theThrone of Glassseries is... and yes it's as epic as that sounds. Sarah J. does it again. Another stunning build of a book. This review is going to be so hard to write. I want to gush. I want to scream. I want to rage about this book, but can't because *sigh* spoilers. As much as I want to spoil this for you I wont. I will still write my feelings about it and highlight a few moments I loved, but I just wanted to give warning this review WONT have spoilers in it... I will say that if you haven't taken the time to read this series you're a fool and I have no idea what you're doing with your life, besides living it wrong!Queen of Shadowspicks up right whereHeir of Fireleft off; pulling us behind a car by our heartstrings. There are a lot of characters introduced and finally produced in this book that I unfortunately wont be able to touch base on in this review. Just understand that the smallest player can end up playing the biggest part. Anyways, I'll just jump right into our main players. First off lets talk about Dorian. God, I love him in this book (If you've read QOS you probably read that sentence and thought I was insane but I don't care). I absolutely loved reading from his point of view. The complete change from light to dark had me drawn in. He became such a stellar character in this novel. He is a true wild card at this point in time. Then there's Choal. I know people love Choal. That in the previous books everyone has been \"team Choal this\" \"team Choal that\", however if you know or have read any of my review for this series then you know I have not been team Choal---or even team Dorian. Choal does give us a ton of character development and growth in this book, and I love his character but he's still not one of my favorites in this series. Then we have a \"newer\" player, \n  Aedion\n... Love him. His sass, his loyalty, his personality shine so bright in this book. I just couldn't get enough of him. And the growing bromance between him and Rowan had me dying. This leads me too the two people I've been dying ta get ta....Yes, Rowan and Celaena. I know that Celaena officially goes by Aelin in this book, but I'm going to warn you now that I will probably always call her Celaena or \"C\". These two... OMG. THESE TWO KILL ME!!!!!!I haven't shipped a ship this hard in the longest and it has me all sorts of giddy.Again if you've read my review in the past then you know whose team I've always been on... Team Rowan. From the moment this man was introduced it was signed, sealed, delivered.I LOVE HIM!!!! Good gods I love him.Though we got a good deal of him inHOFit isn't even half of what we get out of him in this book. We get to see into his brain. We get to see how he is feeling, he's stages of thinking, and his feeling towards Celaena in a way we haven't been able to in the past. It has be swooning all over the place. Everything he does and says will win you over. He was already on myfavorite fictional guyslist but lets just say after reading this he has defeintely moved up on the list. I can't wait to see where their bond takes them.It's refreshing to have a character in this series that generally understands her struggles and the weight that has been put on her shoulders. Lastly we have Celaena.I have said it on many many occasions that Celaena is my all time favorite female character.Queen of Shadowsjust further justified this for me.She is one cunning, whip smart, silver tongued, bad-ass bitch.QOSby far gives the best description I've ever heard of her...\"A storm given flesh.\"That sentence is so spot on it isn't even real. InQOSya girl is taking no prisoners. No seriously, If Celaena was in aGOThouse she would be a freaking Lannister... and yall know why... Because a Sardothien always pays her debts.I can't even count how many times I screamed \"OH MY GOD\" over something she did. At one point in time this was my goodreads status update...\"Seriously????!!? Did C just drop the mic??? UH YEAH SHE DID!! Seriouslyjust screamed \"oooooooooooh damn\" and scared the crap out of my dog.She just such a badass\"... Everything she does is so calculated that when you finally see all the pieces come together you'll be exploding.Your brain will have to take several cold showers to get over the mind rape she will do to you.If there was something you wanted from C that you didn't get in the past you'll get it in this one. She gives you a side of her we haven't seen. This raw real emotion that takes her character to a whole new level. Celaena's character in this novel had me bowing down to the real Queen that is Sarah J Maas. *Insert slow clap*. Bravo! Thank you for making a character that is the epitome of strong leading female. Yes Celanea might go a little stray cray here and there, but God... She might want a man but she doesn't need one. She can do bad all by herself. Sarah continued to show that you can be tough but still love the things you want. You can wield a sword but still love dresses. That you can be all these strong willed tough as nails things, but still love deep. There's no other word to describe Celanea's character besides amazing. As for the characters I couldn't mention, they truly hold their own in this book. One surprise after another. There is one certain witch in particular that I can't wait to see in the next book.I know I talked a lot about the characters and not so much about the plot. Again that is only because we are now four books deep people.QOSis the perfect balance of action packed scenes, romance, fighting, plotting, and build up. This is basically me the whole time... Page 1-170 I thank Maas for giving me everything back. Page 181 I die. Page 295 I freak the f out! Page 319 I cry my eyes out. Paged 320 I curl up in a ball and die again. 370 I realize that if my heart wasn't stolen by C before it's was officially taken. Page 400-656 I don't breathe and can't feel my body. I cry. I swoon. I die again and didn't even know that was physically possible. Swoon some more. Then do my final freak out. This is all without even mentioning the crazy plot twists that happen. They sneak up on you and tear your heart and eyes both out. Sometimes at the same time. And that ending, though a lot of lose ends are taken care of it still has me so conflicted. I just don't know where this story is headed. My heart is telling me it going to go one place while my head tells me to expect another.The whole ending plays out just like a movie. So vivid you can see and feel the whole thing. Just phenomenal.Queen of Shadowswas well worth the wait and hanging around till the next book comes out might just do me in. Don't even get me start on how we still get at least two more books! Sarah J. Maas continues to surprise me with a series I never even thought I would like, but has turned out to be one of my favorites.All in allQueen of Shadowsis about finding your place in the world. Consuming what you must and then fighting for what you love. That you yourself can be your best friend or your worst enemy. That it isn't about how heavy the weight is but about how long you hold it. That you get to choose your future. That your past might have built you but that it doesn't have to define you. That one person can truly rattle the stars.originally read September 2015.Re-read August 2016"

But, life happens and I haven't had as much time to dedicate to reading these days.Anyway, that's besides the point and interesting to, well, no one.Moving on.I really loved all the character interactions and dynamics going on in this installment. I just love epic fantasies involving loyalty and character development/surprises and this book was rife with examples of both.The last 200 pages or so were especially awesome as the larger plot lines unfolded. I can't wait to start the next book. And even more exciting? Knowing this series is fully complete now...and and that I already have all the remaining books on my shelves ready to go.Small life victories, my friends!"

I HAVE NOT KNOWN LOVE UNTIL I MET THIS BOOK. I don't even know how to form a coherent review on this. So sorry in advance because this is mainly just going to be a jumbled mess of me trying to put into words how much I loved this.*ANYTHING BELOW WILL NOT BE SPOILER FREE*You've been warned.Let's just dive into the list of things I love.1. Lysandra. HOLY SHIT. This bitch came out of nowhere and went from being one of my least favorite characters to one of my favorite. I LOVED that we got to learn more about her backstory and the fact that she even had a back story. She was everything I could have hoped for and more. Her friendship with Aelin was so fucking epic, and everything Aelin did for her seriously made me want to cry. She deserves it all. LYSANDRA IS ONE BADASS BITCH. Not only did we learn why she hasn't paid off her debts BUT she's also a shapeshifter. When she saved Rowan and Aedion by shifting into a ghost leopard I flipped, like actually flipped and loved her EVEN MORE.Word to the wise, don't mess with Lysandra.2. Asterin's heart to heart with Manon. I knew that there was going to be SOMETHING going on with Asterin from the way she reacted to the witch covens being forced to produce demon babies. However, I was not quite expecting a backstory that deep. Manon's reaction to her story was even better, meaning that EoS is probably going to have some intense scenes with Manon and good ol' granny. SIGN ME THE F UP.3. When Aedion realized Aelin was in the castle and was in fact about to save him. My heart skipped a few beats.4. When Aelin visited Sam's grave. My heart did not skip a few beats and I'm pretty sure it almost stopped because of how hard I ugly cried. I actually woke my husband up that's how hard I cried.Whatever.Shoot me.5. Chaol. Soooooooo, here's the thing, Alana 100 pages deep in this book would have told Chaol to jump off a cliff. But, Alana 400,500, and 600 pages deep just wanted to hug him and tell him she still loves him and that it's all going to be okay. He grew on me so much throughout this book because of his character growth. And I loved that there was zero awkwardness between him and Aelin.Which leads us to #6.6. ROWAN.Need I say more?Probably not, but I will.My heart beats for Rowan and Aelin. They are it for me. First of all, the tension between the two of them left me fanning myself off. Or dumping a pitcher of cold water over my head like Rowan did ;). These two are EVERYTHING because they heal each other. They have both suffered insurmountable loss that most people would never recover from but together they are better.Rowan is ruthless, loyal, massive, brutal, and extremely aggressive. Above all though, he is a gentlemen. A GENTLEMEN. Who cannot handle a nightgown in the slightest, but still a gentleman.7. Manon vs. Aelin. EPICNESS to say the least. I CANNOT wait for more scenes between the two of them, because holy tempers, they are wild.8. Kaltain tricking the duke and burning down Morath. Another moment of pure epicness that left my mouth gaping for a good few hours. Just another badass woman in this story. Annnnd, let's not forget the little quest she sent Elide on. SO pumped for that.9. Chaol and Dorian reuniting. Queue the tears. When Chaol cried realizing Dorian was saved I'm pretty sure a piece of me died inside because I was so happy. The bromance is real my friends.10. The clock tower blowing up and ruining the castle.I imagine it looking a lil like this.And last but not least 11. Aelin setting foot back on Terrasen soil. THE BITCH DID IT. She really did it. I cannot wait for her reclaim her throne and bring hell to those who deserve it.\"She was fire, and light, and ash, and embers. She was Aelin Fireheart, and she bowed for no one and nothing, save the crown that was hers by blood and survival and triumph.\"YAAAAAAS, my queen!!!!! I cannot wait to see what EoS brings to the table."

I was a little iffy there because I wasn't sure if Rowan was going to be in it but it's all good :-)Celaena/Aelin has returned to Rifthold. She's trying to sneak in undercover. She has a little bit of a different look for a bit.A little bit of hair dye goes a long way, but most people knows who she is. She is back to save her cousin and do what she needs to do to get rid of the evil in the land.I fell in love with Lysandra in this book, I love what she truly is and when Aelin does what she does to change a few things, it is on with all of the \"special\" people :) That's all I can say...you know, the spoiler thing!Anyhoo, I love that Aelin is more of a bad arse than she was before, but then again she found her true self while she was gone. I love her cousin Aedion and what we find out about him. It's just all so awesome!I wasn't pleased with Chaol in the first of the book, but it all came together in the end.The whole group, even some of the evil ones, got together and fought the good fight. TOGETHER! Well, ya know, there is a little bit more evil in their world so it's best if some of them hook up and get it done.And finally we have a kiss that I was waiting for the whole book :)I thought the chemistry with all of the characters in the book was wonderful! This was the best book by far, although, I did love Heir of Fire a lot as well. So many people came together and with so many plots and schemes that were just brilliant. It's certainly not over, you just know there is going to be more to do with the way the book ended! I can't wait for more!!MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List"

Idk why it took me so long, but it was an experience 😌The only issue I had was the pacing and I felt something was lacking in the first 40% of the book- it was Rowan. As soon as he came into picture, things started picking up and so did my interest. Ahh I love Aelin and him so much 😩😩I did not sadly particularly care for Manon much in this one but it seems to be a more of \"me issue\" not the story issue. Chaol's personality...I did not mind it that much, he has been through a fair bit, so looking forward to seeing what lies ahead of him. Also looking forward to Dorian and how he heals.Aelin is obviously such a badass. There's no competition.Cannot wait to read the next book in the series 😍😍"

After HEIR, I had to take a break, because the book wasso longand there were so many more characters, 90% of whom I didn't really care about. Honestly, CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was where I mostly stopped caring because that's when the book stops being a fairy tale retelling and starts being a knockoffGame of Thrones, only with more pining and shopping.***WARNING: SPOILERS***Celery Saltine-thin is probably one of my least favorite characters in the history of ever, and what makes it more ironic is thatI've never had a character forced down my throatthis hard.Celery does nothing but gloat about how awesome she is, and you might think that the other POVs might offer a hint of respite from this, but no - whether they love her or hate her, they're still obsessed with how much they want to have sex with her/kill her/befriend her. It's like that Lady Sovereign song.EVERYTHING is about Celery.HEIR OF FIRE is where the series starts to broaden in scope and jam-pack in way more POVs and characters, and QUEEN OF SHADOWS takes that a step further. Everyone gets a narration in this story, no manner how minor the character. I was half-expecting one of those sexy nightgowns that Celery is so fond of wearing to have a POV (and if the nightgowndidhave a POV, it would probably pour forth glowing adulations about the perfection incarnate that is her hot bod, and how honored and delighted this humble nightgown is to clothe the glorious form that is Celery). We're also introduced to Listeria, Arobynn, Elide, Lorcan, Asterin, and a bunch of other minor characters that I've already forgotten about. I haven't even bothered to come up for nicknames for most of them. Good luck keeping them all separate. I couldn't go more than a couple pages with a new character pushing a slightly-less-new character out of my short-term memory. Eventually, I gave up trying to keep them all straight. I figured a lot of them would probably be killed off, anyway, and I was mostly right.At this point, I'm mostly in it to satisfy my own morbid curiosity because there's a handful of characters I still care about. Unfortunately, Maas has this habit of either a) killing off the most likable characters, b) destroying the personalities of the most likable characters and turning them into total trash people, or c) utterly ruining the most likable characters and leaving them broken and miserable beings, as if to punish them for NOT being Celery. Everyone is always talking about what a great character Mutton (Manon) is, but in this book I couldn't stand her. She basically sold out her own people to be raped, and there was no salvation for them at all. She was awfully cavalier about it, too, for an allegedly take-no-prisoners character that so many reviewers on my feed are fond of calling \"a queen.\" Yeah, a bad one. And you know what happens to bad queens, right? Kaltain makes an appearance, only to go the way of basically any other powerful and attractive female character in this book who isn't Celery. And then Durian, Onion, and Kale are all built up to be destroyed, only to be reassmbledyet again, and when the book is steeped in more misery than an emo kid's Livejournal circa 2005, it's kind of hard to dredge up much emotion, especially when characterization is already so weak, since everything is told and not shown, and told in the most purple prose imaginable, too.Then of course there's the main couple, Raisin (Rowan) and Celery (you-know-who). Their Suzy Homemaking portions of the book that mostly involve sexy nightgowns, vows of companionship, lots of pining and mutual admiration, and \"no-we-mustn'ts!\" are so freaking annoying. I liked Raisin better when he called Celery on her sh*t in the previous book and held her accountable for her arrogance, hypocrisy, and utter b*tchiness. In this book, he swallows the Team Celery handbook and follows her around like a well-trained dog performing demeaning tricks for a steak. Her cousin, Onion (Aedion) who is also in love with her is the exact same way. And after a few testosterone-laden showdowns filled with fancy words and meaningful glances, Onion steps aside for Raisin, while continuing to extol them both - but far be it from Maas to leave anyone in this book single. I already have a feeling who he's going to be paired off with and that person is Listeria. (Sorry, I know that's not a vegetable; but at least it's a bacteria that can be foundonvegetables, yeah?)I gotsofreaking tired of Celery and her smugness in this book. Literally everything she said or did made me want to slap her. How many times do I have to hear about how great she is? Or how she's too good to share her plans or intel - even with her alleged allies? She is seriously the worst queen ever, always sneering at people who criticize her, and failing epically at any sort of subtlety or stealth. I rolled my eyes when we found out the \"truth\" about Arobynn because of coursehewould want to bang her too - why is that a shock? Practically everyone else who's appeared in this book has.The writing in this book also takes a nose-dive. There's a lot of unnecessary scenes and the book is a lot longer than it needed to be. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT was probably the best book in this series so far because it had action and it was also a lot shorter, and Ialmostgave that book, as well as HEIR OF FIRE, a three-star rating, because they were such an improvement over the first book, which is basically a dress-eating, candy-eating extravaganza of fail. QUEEN OF SHADOWS is much longer than it needs to be, clocking in at 560+ pages in the EPUB edition that I got from my library and 600+ pages in the paperback. At least 200 pages of this book could have been shaved off or shortened for conciseness. I didn't need all the Raisin and Celery scenes, and all of the Durian Being Tortured scenes were virtually identical. This author also has some very notable word tics, like \"midnight,\" \"glorious,\" \"incarnate,\" and \"swagger.\" Between the lengthy and dull scenes interspersed between the action sequences and the repeated words, it kind of felt like the editor had gone on vacation.Also, hilariously, while the previous three books were relatively clean (albeit HEIR OF FIRE being way more violent), Maas suddenly discovers swearing, with the word \"sh*t\" sometimes being used multiple times per page, and numerous sexual references and sexual scenes, in addition to a notable increase in violence and disturbing content (particularly that ending scene with Durian's father, which is probably one of the darkest and most miserable reveals that I've encountered in YA). Some people have said that this is because Celery is older in this book, but only by two years! She was seventeen in this first book - and she's a seventeen-year-old who has been imprisoned and had sex, so there's no reason she shouldn't be swearing more or suddenly discovering sex for the first time, because these are things that she's already been exposed to; they shouldn't benovel. It was really weird. Even though I haven't read the last book for several months and have already forgotten a lot of what happened in it, I found myself side-eying some phrases, and thinking, \"This seems very extra.\"Now that I've talked about the things I hated, I'm going to discuss the things that I liked. Abraxos is cool. Even though Mutton is trying so hard to come across as Daenerys Targaryen II (while coming across more as a Dragonite owner who doesn't have enough gym badges to make her wayward Pokemon obey) while also enabling the rape, torture, and impregnation of her people and I hate her, her wyvern is cool and kind of adorable. Unfortunately, he doesn't have as many funny scenes in this book and it's mostly just about his owner, who I now despise.Listeria is also a pretty cool character, even if she does fall a little too neatly into the whore/courtesan with the heart of gold stereotype. I look forward to seeing her more in the second book, although part of me is afraid that Maas is either going to utterly null out her edgier parts or just completely remake her character to force her into a stupid romantic relationship like she did with Durian and Sorscha.I also liked the plotting and some of the more devious parts of this book. I told someone who commented on one of my status updates that I do honestly feel like there's a good book in here clamoring to get out, but the Mary Sue protagonist holds the story back, and I still think that's true. It's hard to respect a main character when all of the sacrifices fall on the literal backs of her friends.Speaking of backs, poor Chaol. I still haven't forgiven Maas for what she did to his character in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, especially since he was the only male character I really shipped with Maas out of the 5+ \"experiments\" that have been lobbed at her so far. I couldn't believe how stupid the reason was for Celery's flounce and it seemed to cement her impulsive selfishness that she would do what she did without actually taking a moment to TALK to him instead of running like a lil' b*tch. What she did to him in this book was just as bad - making him suffer even more for Celery's sake, after she was rude to him for 3/4 of the book. Yeah, he didn't deserve that. F her.Apart from that, I actually did like the ending. It wasintense.BTW, I've had a number of people ask me why I read these books if I didn't like them which is kind of a silly question because 1) how can you know you don't like something unless you read it? and 2) you can read a book you don't like and still enjoy it. That's why people enjoy trash cinema, or \"Z movies.\" Sometimes it's fun to take something you don't like or think is ridiculous and make fun of it; that's the whole point behind the cult classic TV show,Mystery Science Theater 3000, which basically reviewed pulpy movies from the 1970s and earlier. I enjoy doing similar things with romance novels. I've explained this many times, defending my choices. Some fans of this book, however, are ridiculously entitled and rude enough to the point that they will come onto these reviews and leave passive-aggressive remarks insulting me.I will block you if you do this, so please keep in mind that if you have a comment about my reviewing style, the place to do this is not on my review itself but as I mentioned on HEIR OF FIRE, by calling the \"1-800-GIRL-BYE\" hotline. It gets a lot of callers, so you might be on hold a while. Perhaps forever. Sorry about that.Overall, my thoughts about this series have pretty much remained fairly internally consistent. I don't really get the hype and while there are some favorable things about this series, I really can't stand the heroine and it often feels like one of those generic epic fantasies, in the vein ofGame of Thrones. I put EMPIRE OF STORMS on hold at the library, so I will probably be reading that soon, and also Chaol's book as well, in preparation for the final book in this series and the end to this experiment. It will be interesting to see how this tangled knot of characters and motivations is resolved, if at all.1.5 to 2 stars"

        "user_review": "Life is full of missed opportunities and hard decisions. Sometimes it's difficult to know what to actually do.Dublinerscreates an image of an ever movie city, of an ever moving exchange of people who experience the reality of life. And that's the whole point: realism. Not everything goes well, not everything is perfectly constructed. Life is random and unpredictable. If we're not careful it may escape from us entirely.There are two types of stories inDubliners.The first, and by far the most effective, are those associated with despair, nihilism and death. The second type deals with more ordinary aspects of modern life, the representation of the city and social exchanges. As a collection they provide an image of dark, murky city struggling to cope with the problems associated with rapid urbanisation. The stories do not intertwine, but you are left with the impression that they are not that far from each other: their proximity feels close as you read further into each one.The true mastery of Joyce's writing reveals itself in what he doesn't say, the subtle suggestions, the lingering questions, as each story closes without any sense of full resolution. And, again, is this not true of real life? In narrative tradition there is a structured beginning, middle and end, but in the reality of existence it doesn't quite work this way. Life carries on. It doesn't have a form of narrative closure, a convenient wrapping up of plot, after each wound we take in life. It carries on. We carry on. And for the Dubliners isolation carries on.\"He could not feel her near him in the darkness nor hear her voice touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone.\""

        "user_review": "Dubliners, James JoyceIn his stories, Joyce combines heterogeneous elements. Poetic mysticism is expressed in a naturalistic way.They pay attention to sound and melody for illustration. In their works, they always use humor and irony and references to myths and holy books.If the reader can grasp all these mysteries, he will be glad that he may not be able to read any other work.Joyce is a language engineer before he became a writer.Joyce's particular view of language, and the word, as the cells that make up the body of the story, is so profound and original that critics are still struggling to uncover the vague layers of his stories.The sections are hidden side by side in new words, invented by Joyce himself. There are two completely different opinions about Joyce.Some consider him a complex lunatic. That his conflict with language has led him astray, and others who say he has unparalleled talent, which is beyond human comprehension today.Joyce's innovation in language is unbelievable. Not only do they bring to life the ancient words of their language; They also make words in their works. Sometimes, words with more than a hundred letters, or a combination of several words, that make up a word, show a multiple sense.Multi-layered words that tell and convey several secrets. According to Joyce, the world is in bad shape.In which lowly joys and poverty and depravity threaten human life.The book embraces and embraces a collection of fifteen short stories, including issues such as Irish history; Human beings; Death; Love; Life; Fear and ...; Have written.Dubliners is a collection of fifteen short stories by James Joyce, first published in 1914. They form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century.The stories:The Sisters– After the priest Father Flynn dies, a young boy who was close to him and his family deals with his death superficially.An Encounter– Two schoolboys playing truant encounter a middle-aged man.Araby– A boy falls in love with the sister of his friend, but fails in his quest to buy her a worthy gift from the Araby bazaar.Eveline– A young woman weighs her decision to flee Ireland with a sailor.After the Race– College student Jimmy Doyle tries to fit in with his wealthy friends.Two Gallants– Two con men, Lenehan and Corley, find a maid who is willing to steal from her employer.The Boarding House– Mrs Mooney successfully manoeuvres her daughter Polly into an upwardly mobile marriage with her lodger Mr Doran.A Little Cloud– Little Chandler's dinner with his old friend Ignatius Gallaher casts fresh light on his own failed literary dreams. The story also reflects on Chandler's mood upon realising that his baby son has replaced him as the centre of his wife's affections.Counterparts– Farrington, a lumbering alcoholic scrivener, takes out his frustration in pubs and on his son Tom.Clay– The old maid Maria, a laundress, celebrates Halloween with her former foster child Joe Donnelly and his family.A Painful Case– Mr Duffy rebuffs Mrs Sinico, then, four years later, realises that he has condemned her to loneliness and death.Ivy Day in the Committee Room– Minor politicians fail to live up to the memory of Charles Stewart Parnell.A Mother– Mrs Kearney tries to win a place of pride for her daughter, Kathleen, in the Irish cultural movement, by starring her in a series of concerts, but ultimately fails.Grace– After Mr Kernan injures himself falling down the stairs in a bar, his friends try to reform him through Catholicism.The Dead– Gabriel Conroy attends a party, and later, as he speaks with his wife, has an epiphany about the nature of life and death. At 15–16,000 words this story has also been classified as a novella. The Dead was adapted into a film by John Huston, written for the screen by his son Tony and starring his daughter Anjelica as Mrs. Conroy.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «دوبلینیها»؛ «مردگان»؛ «دوبلینی ها و نقد دوبلینی ها»؛ نویسنده: جیمز جویس؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز پانزدهم اکتبر سال 1984میلادیعنوان: دوبلینی ها؛ نویسنده: جیمز جویس؛ مترجم: پرویز داریوش؛ تهران، اشرفی، 1346؛ در 227ص؛ چاپ دیگر: انتشارات آبان؛ 1362؛ چاپ دیگر: تهران، اساطیر، 1371؛ در 214ص؛ شابک: 9643312410؛ موضوع: داستانهای کوتاه از نویسندگان ایرلند - سده 20ممترجم: محمدعلی صفریان، تهران، نیلوفر، چاپ نخست 1372، در 300ص و 143ص؛ چاپ دوم 1378؛ چاپ سوم، 1383؛ چاپ پنجم 1388؛ شابک 9789644481024؛ دوبلینی ها ص 1، تا ص 300، ترجمه صفریان، و ص 1، تا ص 143، آینه ای در راه، مقالاتی در نقد دوبلینیها با ترجمه صالح حسینیمترجم: صالح حسینی، تهران، نیلوفر، چاپ نخست 1389، در 453ص؛ شابک 9789644484681؛مترجم: سولماز واحدی کیا؛ تهران، کوله پشتی؛ 1389؛ در 200ص؛ شابک 9786005337976؛با عنوان: مردگان؛ مترجم: علیرضا متین نیا؛ مشهد، سخن گستر؛ 1389؛ در 228ص؛ شابک 9789644778551؛مترجم: امیر علیجانپور؛ تهران، آوای مکتوب؛ 1394؛ در 232ص؛ شابک 9786007364208؛گویا همین پانزده داستان کوتاه را با عنوان: «بهترین داستانهای کوتاه جیمز جویس»؛ با ترجمه جناب «احمد گلشیری» انتشارات نگاه در سال 1388؛ در402ص منتشر کرده استجویس در داستانهایش، عناصر ناهمگون را باهم درمی‌آمیزند؛ عرفان شاعرانه را، با شیوه ی ناتورالیستی، بیان میکنند، برای تصویرپردازی به صدا و آهنگ صدا، توجه دارند؛ در آثارشان، هماره، از طنز و کنایه و اشاره به اساطیر، و کتاب‌های مقدس، سود می‌برند؛ خوانشگر اگر بتواند این همه رمز و کنایه را دریابد، به لذتی می‌رسد، که شاید از خوانش هیچ اثر دیگری نتواند؛ «جویس» پیش از آنکه نویسنده باشند، یک مهندس زبان هستند؛ نگاه ویژه‌ ی «جویس» به زبان، و واژه، به عنوان سلول‌های تشکیل‌ دهنده‌ ی بدنه‌ ی داستان، چنان ژرف و بدیع است، که هنوز منتقدان، درگیر کشف لایه‌ های مبهم داستان‌های ایشان هستند؛ بخش‌هایی که در لا‌ به‌ لای کلماتی نو، که خود «جویس» اختراع کرده اند، پنهانند؛ در باره «جویس»، دو نظر کاملاً مخالف وجود دارد؛ عده‌ ای او را، دیوانه‌ ی مغلق‌ گو می‌دانند، که درگیری‌ اش با زبان، او را به بیراهه کشانده، و دیگرانی که میگویند؛ ایشان استعدادی بی‌نظیر دارند، که از درک انسان امروز فراتر است؛ نوآوری «جویس» در زبان، ناباورانه است؛ ایشان نه تنها واژه‌ های کهن زبان خویش را زنده می‌کنند؛ بلکه در آثارشان واژه‌ سازی نیز می‌کنند؛ گاه، واژگانی با بیش از صد حرف، و یا ترکیبی از چندین کلمه، که یک کلمه را تشکیل می‌دهد، تا حسی چندگانه را نشان دهد؛ واژه‌ گانی چند لایه که چندین راز را باز میگویند و می‌رسانند؛ به باور «جویس» دنیا بد مخمصه‌ ای ‌است، که در آن شادی‌های حقیر و فقر و رذالت، زندگی انسانها را تهدید می‌کند؛ کتاب مجموعه ای از پانزده داستان کوتاه را، در بر و در آغوش خویش گرفته، که در آنها به مسایلی نظیر: تاریخ ایرلند؛ انسانها؛ مرگ؛ عشق؛ زندگی؛ ترس و... می‌پردازندبیشتر شخصیت‌های داستان‌های این مجموعه، دوباره در کتاب «اولیس» فرا خوانده می‌شوند؛ داستان از نثر بسیار قدرتمندی برخوردار است، و جزو شاهکارهای ادبی به شمار است؛ مجموعه داستان یک سیر ادبی را از ابتدا تا انتها در بر می‌گیرد که به داستان بلند «مردگان» ختم می‌شود؛اسامی داستان‌های کوتاه:خواهرها: کشیش «فلین» می‌میرد و پسر جوان که همراه با خانواده‌ اش برای مراسم ختم او آمده‌ اند یاد خاطرات و کارهای کشیش می‌افتد...؛برخورد: یک بچه از مدرسه بیرون می‌رود...؛عربی: پسری عاشق دختری در محله‌ شان می‌شود، او به بازار «عربی» می‌رود تا برای دختر هدیه‌ ای بخرد...؛اولین: دختری خانواده‌ اش را ترک می‌کند تا همراه با ملوانی برود...؛همتایان؛پس از مسابقه: مردی با دوست و همدرسه‌ ای قدیمی خود روبرو می‌شود...؛دو زن‌ نواز: دو مرد زنی را دنبال می‌کنند تا با او طرح دوستی بریزند...؛ابری کوچک: مردی همراه با دوست قدیمی‌ اش مشغول خوردن ناهار است و به یاد آرزوهایی که داشته میافتدیک روز در ستاد انتخابات: کارکنان یک ستاد انتخاباتی دور هم گرد آمده‌ اند و از پارنل یکی از رهبران مبارزات ایرلند یاد می‌کنند...؛گل؛پانسیون؛یک حادثهٔ دردناک؛مردگان؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 06/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 25/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "Dubliners is a collection of short stories published in 1914. The concluding story is The Dead, which the blurb on GR cites as \"the best short story ever written.\"We are told in a brief introduction that Joyce was a pioneer in popularizing the structure of the modern short story as focused on \"a fleeting but decisive episode.\" Elsewhere I've read of the focus of the modern short story described as 'the moment.'So, is The Dead the greatest short story ever written? I'll add my two cents: I first read it 50 years ago in college. I've always remembered it as if I read it yesterday. How many of the hundreds of short stories I have read since then can I say that about?Many of the stories are very short - only four or five pages. Here are a few samples:In The Sisters, their brother, a priest, dies at home. Was it because he broke a chalice during mass shortly before his death?In An Encounter, two boys play hooky from school and encounter a strange man. His conversation is such that it seems he might be a molester.In Araby, a young boy lives in a house in which a priest died a short time ago. The young boy is frustrated in trying to buy a present at a bazaar for his puppy love.In Eveline, a young woman debates leaving her father and running off to Buenos Aires with her lover.In Two Gallants, a young man waits to see the result of his best friend's visit to a young woman they assume is a prostitute.In A Little Cloud, a man is jealous of his friend's success in London. He determines that you have to 'go away' for success. He feels trapped in Ireland by his wife and baby.In A Painful Case, a man frequently visits a married woman and her daughter at home. The husband thinks he's visiting because he's interested in the daughter. He's not.Some of the stories are modern in outlook, bringing up issues of feminism and racism. The Dead touches on both issues during conversation around the Christmas table. An elderly aunt is furious about boys getting preference over girls in a choir. A man around the table raises the issue of no one appreciating a great tenor. \"Is it because he's only a black?\"The story, A Mother, focuses on a dispute over a payment for her daughter singing in a choir. \"They wouldn't have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man.\"Top photo: Grafton Street, Dublin, early 1900s from vintag.esA still from a movie made of The Dead, (Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann) from irishcentral.comPostcard of Dublin in the 1920s from monksbarn.wordpress.comThe author from theculturetrip.com[Pictures added 11/15/2021; edited 8/11/23]"

        "user_review": "InThe Dead, the last story in this collection, Gabriel Conroy recounts an anecdote about his grandfather and his horse, Johnny, who used to walk in circles to drive the grinding stone in a mill. One day, the grandfather harnessed the horse and took him out to a military review. But Johnny, disoriented as he passed by a statue of William III, started circling the monument stubbornly as if he were back at the mill. This little tale within a tale encapsulates perfectly the spirit and essence of Joyce'sDubliners.At first glance, Joyce's stories could be read as a series of naturalistic vignettes, \"slices of life\" depicting the insignificant day-to-day misfortunes of a few random Irish characters at the turn of the 20th century. Children playing in the street, young girls playing the piano, working men getting drunk and mouthing off at the pub… In a way, that is indeed whatDublinersis about: the shabby neighbourhoods, the outdatedmanière d'être, the constricted lives, the frustrated yearnings and the spiritual bleakness of those times.Dublinersis also a twin ofA Portrait of the Artist, where Joyce focuses on minor characters rather than on Stephen Dedalus.Of course, there is more to these tales than meets the eye. Firstly, most of these trivial stories hark back to deeper cultural, even archetypal models: the Arthurian quest (Araby), or the voyage from Hell to Heaven (Grace) – Johnny, the horse, as an eternal and hopeless Sisyphus, etc. Secondly, Joyce also infuses these tales with the political arguments of his time: the debates around Irish identity, Protestantism and the influence of the Catholic Church, the unionist and the separatist movements (still topical today), and the general opinion that Ireland was being strangled by the crown of England – again, old Johnny going round and round at the foot of King Billy.Further still, the overarching structure of these tales takes the reader through the different stages of life, like a disjointedBildungsroman. Childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age and death. Indeed, the motif of death frames the entire collection, from the remains of Father Flynn at the very beginning, to the distant loss of Michael Furey at the end, and the eternal snow falling over an ever-darkening universe. This recurring theme makesDubliners, at the core, a sort of literaryvanitas, and the fifteen stories, taken as a whole, reveal a poignant picture of the transience of life and the circularity of time.John Huston's last film, an adaptation ofThe Dead, is an underrated and heart-breaking masterpiece that captures exactly the nostalgic atmosphere of Joyce's novella."

And about those Irish stereotype? Might they have been given voice by Joyce through Dubliners?A highly influential work from a respected, inspiring author - this is great reading."

He felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend's, and it seemed to him unjust.A rogue of an incompetent petty clerk whose only pleasure is drinking… A timorous service girl's day off… A lonely man frightened of any human relationship… Empty talks and idle drinking… A despotic mother's foolish behaviour… Drunkenness and piety… The Christmas celebration as a culmination of the year…A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef.Celebrations end… Life continues…Infants are born… The aged die… And traditions are kept from generation to generation."

When I was in college and Uni I was all about contemporary literature (Marquez, Reverte, Murakami) and I missed many of the \"must read\" authors. I am trying to redeem myself now.I chose the Dubliners because I knew I would never have the will and patience to finish Ulysses. I have to admit that although I understand the value of the volume and its structure, I did not like it. It bore me terribly. I fell asleep while reading many times and it was a struggle to follow the stories. Some stories were really good but the majority were just boring. I also read a couple of analysis for the stories which were far more interesting than the stories themselves."

        "user_review": "Before embarking towards my maiden Joyce read, I prepared myself to pour in as much effort required on my part to understand Dubliners. I didn't assume them to be incomprehensible or distant, but an anxiety akin to meeting a known stranger for the first time was definitely present. The said anxiety shortly materialized into a much-awaited prospect after reading the opening story and finally transformed into a confident and gentle companion who led me through the sepia streets of an unassuming city. Dublin, as I soon realized, was just around the corner.I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's play, ugly monotonous child's play.Calmly engaged within the secure air of its daily affairs, the people of Dublin were also ostensibly calm and secure and yet a moment reflection about a dormant or potential life managed to extract stories which were snuggled in simple form and simpler titles but traced intricate and at times, unheeded emotions. An aimless walk concluded in cheap happiness and an embarrassing accident convinced someone to search for an elusive redemption. A death unveiled the value of oblivious living while a motherly conduct was driven by frustrations and misplaced ambitions. Most of these characters were representative, not whole but of a remarkable fragment of lives that we either experience ourselves or witness in others during the time we live.She sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life.A perpetual struggle for attention between past and present was an integral part of these stories sans any violent clashes. Some of them appeared as if being viewed from a neighbor's window and some welcomed me through a cordial door and took their time to introduce every element of the household. I admired how well the majority of people were coping with the consequences of their choices and how easily they found humor in the ironies of life. And I quailed on seeing the suffocation of the negligible minority on being caught in the web of their inhibitions. I understood that even after getting a crystal clear view of their circumstances from a vantage point, they still refused to adopt a different course, to sail away to a different country, to a dreamy world.It was hard work – a hard life – but now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.With every subsequent narration, I imagined Joyce to be in deep contemplation about everything and everyone around him. I imagined him to carefully select an appropriate frame for his various thoughts and placing each one of them at their desirous place. I imagined how he must have wanted to capture an epiphanic moment among the melancholic tune of Irish songs, when he wanted to paint a picture with decided title but undecided colors; or when he simply wished to write about the approachable beauty of that girl on other side of the pavement. I imagined his joy for the love and pain at the criticism for his native place. I was left in awe of the virtuosity of this young man and the several portraits he created with his words.He had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense.And when I reached the end, I simply wished to possess a literary talent like this for a very short time to write a story of my own and discreetly slip it into this collection. Dublin and Dubliners felt that close to me."

It would not be easy to speak of enhancement since Joyce does not idealize his compatriots. In rich and neat language, Joyce describes the Irish capital at the beginning of the 20th century through stories plunging into a rampant bourgeois daily life.From schoolchildren who left to skip school to supporters of Charles Parnell, the hero of independence, Joyce is more attached to the inhabitants than the city itself. The author describes the frustrations of social conventions that are impossible to eliminate: the lost loves and the desires for elsewhere—a genuine literary photograph of the city."

        "user_review": "I was put off by reading James Joyce because I was scared of reading him — that I wouldn't understand a damn thing he said although I knew he was a brilliant writer…one for the ages. I think it was 'Ulysses' that scared me off, and I made a massive generalization (if I don't understand that book, I won't understand anything by Joyce). My mistake.I remember a Goodreads friend recommended I read it, because I think I or they had read a short story collection (whose author escapes me right now), and they said there was some similarity of 'Dubliners' to the short story collection we were discussing. So, I procured a copy and was blown away. My copy was an issue by Oxford World's Classics. There were oodles of footnotes to each story near the back of the book, and after I read a short story I would then go the back of the book and read the footnotes (not every footnote but a large number of them). I learned a lot via the footnotes, and found them to be very interesting.There were 15 stories, and as I read, I took notes and rated each story — I'll just list the ratings next to the stories (average is 3.8 stars but add in the Introduction, an alternative translation of 'Sisters', and the footnotes and it adds up to 5 by my reckoning. 😊 ).•\tSisters: 4 stars•\tAn Encounter: 3.5 stars•\tAraby: 4 stars•\tEveline: 4.5 stars•\tAfter the Race: 2 stars•\tTwo Gallants: 3 stars•\tThe Boarding House: 5 stars•\tA Little Cloud: 4 stars•\tCounterparts: 4.5 stars•\tClay: 3.5 stars•\tA Painful Case: 5 stars•\tIvy Day in the Committee Room: 2 stars•\tA Mother: 3.5 stars•\tGrace: 4 stars•\tThe Dead: 5 starsThat last story 'The Dead' has to be one of the best short stories I have read in a long time. So much to pack in it (it was about 40 pages long). The last page in which the husband Gabriel is thinking about the young man who once loved his wife, and she him, before Gabriel came onto the scene was just … so sad, so beautifully written. What a wonderful way to end the short story collection… \"His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\"I learned where \"beyond the pale\" came from. Up until today, I was clueless.•\t'The pale' was the name given in the 14th century to that part of Ireland over which England exercised jurisdiction before the whole was conquered; centered on Dublin, it varied in extent at different times from the reign of Henry II until full conquest under Elizabeth I' in 'in the pale', 'pale' connotes 'civilization' or 'civilized behavior'; here, it means specifically 'conceding in his behavior the authority of the Church' and ironically inverts the historical meaning where the 'wild' Irish Catholic native population existed 'beyond the pale'; they now, of course, figuratively represent 'the pale' itself (referred to in 'Grace').I didn't know in Catholicism that The Immaculate Conception (mother of Jesus having conceived although a virgin), though a generally held belief from the time of the Middle Ages, did not become dogma until 1854 (from 'Grace').There was one part of a short story I found to be quite humorous ('The Dead'): several Catholics are conversing with a Protestant. Mr. Browne, about monks who put people up who visit them at the monastery and do not charge room and board, and the kind of ascetic lifestyle the monks live:He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.—\t\"That's the rule of the order,\" said Aunt Katie firmly.—\t\"Yes, but why?\" asked Mr. Browne.—\tAunt Katie repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world, The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:—\t\"I like that idea very much but wouldn't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?\"One final observation from me and then I'll shut my piehole. There were a number of stories in which people were alcoholic, or were drunk, or their family wished they would stay abstinent. In the majority of cases the alcoholism centered on male characters. (The cover illustration shows a man at a pub with a beer mug in his hand ('Porter at the Fair' by Jack B. Yeats, 1910)."

Or are they one single long story?\"A Portrait of the City as an Old and Stultifying Enclave.\"?This story fashions a kaleidoscopic vision of Dublin in the early 1900s. This is a city enclosed in a gray cylinder that a hand turns periodically and new scenes are conjured up for the contemplation of a single (male) eye. The same components reappear, falling in different places playing different relationships with each other; some others disappear forever or stay hidden in the corners to may be reappear again after all. One cannot know how the elements will place themselves on the next turn.Rich collection of elements: youth and adulthood – money matters – trapping marriages – trapping love – ill-conceived duties – Mary – temptations for youth – the ghost of England – the public house – chattered dreams – Jesuits – alcohol – nationalism – unfeminine women – dreams of change – school ploys – Death – Parnell – liberating escape – topographical anchorage of the streets of Dublin.Another turn. And there is Dublin again.And each time we recognize the narrow spaces, the sombre, the dreary, the faded, the routine, and the bleak prospects.The drabness of many of these hovering elements is however transformed by a play of incantation. The desolation is perplexingly denatured into elegance and the stark absence of sentimentality blooms because what it renders is so very genuine. There is a magic wand in the form of a pen of wizardry that by the clothing with words, precisely chosen words, carefully written words, encapsulates the dreariness and creates tales that captivate and enchant us.And may be there is also an additional light in this kaleidoscope that makes these sorry elements shine through those inner reflecting mirrors.The humour of a sparkling and luminous mind.(**)----------------(*) Citiscape.

Oops!), I looked up this title in James Mustich's 1,000 Books. It said that the best story was at the very end of the book.However, the last story is also the longest in the collection. By that time, I was bored, disenchanted, and had relatively no focus.In my opinion, the stories don't build on one another or have repeat characters, and I wish I went into the best story more refreshed.2)\tCreated a list of characters for each storyThese short stories almost felt like they were ripped from a longer book. There are many characters in the stories, and Joyce didn't make them memorable enough to remember.3)\tPlanned to read only one story at a timeInitially, I picked up this book because it has a relatively low page count, and it was recommended by James Mustich (whose taste I greatly respect). When I read the first story, I felt extremely lost. Then, I read it again, figuring I was just tired the first time.Um no.I still had no clue what was going on after the second reading. I cracked open SparkNotes, and, apparently, there was religious symbolism about being paralyzed that I just didn't get even after 2 readings.I ended up spending more time in the research materials than in the source materials.Confession Time:This collection of short stories was really rough. Between the (at times) very long sentence structure of Joyce to some of the archaic language to the many unneeded characters in a short period of time to the extremely subtle symbolism to the uniquely Irish words (like stirabout), I didn't really understand what was going on, and I didn't enjoy the experience of reading this.Here's hoping that Ulysses will be a better experience.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

        "user_review": "James Joyce once said; \"If Dublin suddenly disappeared from the Earth it could be reconstructed out of my book Ulysses\". I have never been to Dublin so I have no idea what it's like today, but through Joyce's writings I have a sense of what it was like in the early 20th century. It's not so much that he describes the physical city, but his descriptions of its establishments, its social and political atmosphere, and especially its people, is so detailed and complete that the physical picture just \"pops up\", like in one of those children's pop up books. It is so in Ulysses and it certainly is true in this book, Dubliners.Dubliners, this collection of 15 short stories, was published in 1914, two years beforeA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manand eight years beforeUlysses. These stories lay the groundwork for his later novels, a primer, if you will. I think it's good advice to anyone just starting on James Joyce works, to start withDubliners. Like all short story collections some are better than others, but they are all good, all consistent, and they never stray from Joyce's verbal painting of his beloved Dublin."

        "user_review": "\"Irlanda es un gran país. Lo llaman la Isla Esmeralda. Después de siglos de estrangulamiento, el gobierno metropolitano la ha dejado desierta y es ahora un campo de barbecho. El gobierno sembró hambre, sífilis, superstición y alcoholismo: puritanos, jesuitas y reaccionarios crecen ahora.\" James JoyceCuando uno recorre la lista de los más grandes escritores que dio la literatura y pone especial atención en aquellos que amaron en el real sentido de la palabra a su tierra natal, la cantidad de autores se acorta notablemente.Además de los aedos griegos, que le escribían a su terruño en forma inevitable descubriremos que ciertos autores tuvieron el concepto de pertenencia muy claro.Muchos escritores sintieron una especialísima afición por su país: García Márquez por Colombia, Balzac, Hugo y Flaubert por Francia, Hawthorne y su naturaleza americana por nombrar algunos.Pero cuando se habla de amor por una ciudad, pocos, muy pocos son los que rescatamos. Creo que junto a Fiódor Dostoievski, un apasionado de su querida San Petersburgo y a Julio Cortázar, desdoblado entre la urbanidad de Buenos Aires y la cosmopolita París, sólo James Joyce es un devoto y fiel amante de su ciudad natal, Dublín, una de las principales ciudades de Irlanda junto a Belfast y Kilkenny.Los quince cuentos y relatos de \"Dublineses\" se impregnan de esa mística irlandesa en sus calles, su gente y edificios. Nuevamente recuerdo a Julio Cortázar porque creo que estos dos autores supieron ahondar profundamente en la idiosincrasia de sus ciudades logrando mostrarnos con firmes pinceladas cómo era la naturaleza real de sus habitantes y de esos submundos descriptos en bares, oficinas, casas, parques, calles, ciudades, muelles y plazas.Joyce retrata en cada cuento la frustración y la soledad de muchos dublineses. La gran mayoría de ellos son simples oficinistas, mucamas, señoras mayores, alcohólicos, políticos de poca monta, jóvenes desempleados. Joyce quiso retratar la \"parálisis\" dublinesa. Los relatos como vienen se van, algunos de ellos quedan abiertos a las múltiples interpretaciones de los lectores y siempre nos dejan un sabor agridulce.La muerte sobrevuela omnipresente y poderosa en muchos de estos cuentos y el desasosiego se instala en los personajes. En la mayoría de estos cuentos los intentos de estos son fútiles, no alcanzan para cubrir sus necesidades, anhelos o esperanzas. No encontraremos aquí pasajes divertidos. Tal vez alguna anécdota cuasi graciosa, pero el ambiente de los cuentos es el de un leve flotar de almas en suspenso.De todos los cuentos y además de \"Los Muertos\", del cual ya hice la reseña correspondiente, los que más me gustaron fueron \"Eveline\", \"Copias\" y \"Un caso doloroso\". Son tres cuentos profundos, escritos con suma fineza y bellísima precisión literaria y creo además que el trato que Joyce le da al contexto psicológico de los personajes es realmente maravilloso.Releer \"Dublineses\" reafirma mi profunda devoción por Joyce, un genial escritor del que supe vencer el \"miedo literario\" a la hora de afrontar su obra más difícil como lo fue el \"Ulises\" y como será en breve leer su \"Finnegan's Wake\".Mientras tanto, la lectura de este libro, \"Los Muertos\" y \"Retrato del artista adolescente\", que constituyen la parte más accesible de su obra definen lo que escribí previamente: que cada día quiero más a James Joyce."

        "user_review": "My first Joyce. The right choice. A collection of stories that some may describe as beautiful, others as boring, maybe even brilliant, but that I want to describe as \"apt\". Dublin is richer, I am sure, due to the fact that it hasDublinersto represent it. From the first story,The Sisters, to the last,The Dead, each story is apt – it is perfectly appropriate, perfectly suitable and fitting for the occasion which it describes. Not a word is out of place. No character does or says anything that is alarming. There are many pieces of praise and criticism that are widely available, all concerning themselves with the careful dissection of this collection, down to a word-by-word level. Lots of these pieces mention the 4-way split in overarching themes for these stories: childhood, adolescence, maturity, and public life. With these 4 pieces, you dive into Dublin, seeing the interaction of trials and tribulations across a variety of ages. Class, caste, gender, societal issues, all apparent in a manner that does not take away from the main point of any story.WithDubliners, I got a little bit of everything. Some stories were interesting to witness from a third-party perspective (I wonder if saying that is arbitrary, seeing as most stories are experienced as such). For instance,An Encounter, where two boys skip out on school for a day, seeing what life brings them. They come across a strange, weird, shady character… an older gentleman that is weirdly obsessed with \"beating\" little boys. Yeah… I got as creeped out as the main character of this story. Some of the tales were boring.Ivy Day in the Committee Room, a story about a collection of people canvassing in preparation for the mayoral elections, had lots of elements about Irish nationalism and independence. I am sure it would have meant much more to someone for whom these issues are a matter of pride and blood. Where this collection was at its strongest, however, was when it was conveying the pathos of everyday life – this is a phenomenon that is similar across nations, time, and class structure.Counterparts, a story that brings to a sharp focus the problem(s) of alcoholism, does much more than just present a set of stereotypes about the Irish. It characterizes the ailment in a person, Farrington, who is not going about life willy-nilly. He istrying, he really is. You find yourself caring for his life, holding a moment of silence for his troubles, and accepting his massive flaws as a human.A Painful Case, a story that shows the depth of loneliness, the abyss that becomes a leech to certain people's personalities, as they become increasingly unable to shake off the narcissism surrounding solitude in favour of a genuine human connection. And finally, who can readDublinerswithout commenting onThe Dead? The climax of the collection, a story that highlights the relativity of all of our lesser or greater concerns in relation to mortality. If you read nothing else but one story from this book, let it be this.I have learned more about Dublin and the Irish with this one book than I may ever have done. Any city would be lucky to have such a candid encyclopedia to its name."

        "user_review": "This is my first reading of Joyce's \"Dubliners.\" I know, shocking, everyone else read it in high school or collegiate undergraduate literature courses and were forced to author papers on Joyce's themes and symbolism. I read it for pleasure and for background on a project I'm working on. It's considered one of Joyce's more accessible works, certainly when compared with \"Ulysses\" which has a reputation for everyone claiming to have read it, but no one actually does. Anyways, I did find it readable, even with it being over a hundred years old and full of references to cultural and colloquial phrases which are beyond me. Anyway, I'll try my hand at a short analysis of this collection of fifteen short stories.The first thing that strikes me is how pedestrian and mundane the characters and even the plots of these tales are. This is the dreary, everyday life of Dublin commoners. It's also largely filled with horrible people – thieves, drunks, and abusers to name a few. Most of the tales either end tragically (e.g., suicide) or at best – an unresolved melancholy stalemate. As I was reading it, I wasn't sure if Joyce was going for a realistic expose of Dublin (sort of a 107-year-old version of a modern reality show) or something else. But when you step back and look at the whole of the book, it shows a stunted Dublin filled with people going nowhere and unable to break out of their gloomy routines and lives. And knowing a little of the history of Ireland, it makes me wonder if this was a delicate cut on the impact of English colonialism and maybe even to a lesser extent the restraints of the Catholic Church. About the only positive you'll take away from 1914 Dublin is the pride in Irish hospitality.Still, despite the dismal subject matter, Joyce writes with beauty. His ability to rapidly create complex characters with realistic needs and desires is extraordinary. He describes everyday life, but with such a fine blend of place, dialog, and narration, it feels all too real. Character's display little notions, quirks, and thoughts that feel authentic, like Joyce is reporting on what's going on around him, but able to jump in everyone's head. The last story is particularly beautifully told, about an annual dance, that spins characters and motivations and songs, food, and drink until you're dizzy. The prose is lush and vivid, but still with the same underlying sadness and cold themes. Although I probably don't have the proper context of 1914 Ireland and Joyce's intentions, I was still able to appreciate this impressive classic."

But this is – a 10 minute excerpt (\"Anna Livia Plurabelle\") read by JJ himselfhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grJC1...I had thought, this small part being so beautiful, that FW would be another masterpiece, but the rest of it isn't one tenth as fascinating or linguistically lovely, and it will do your brain in. The only thing I've been able to do with FW is parody it, rather lamelyhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...which was unnervingly easy to do once you get into the swing of it. The reader who can gain enjoyment on any level from the great mapless madhouse that is FW has my undying respect.ABOUT1.The Most Dangerous Book : The Battle For James Joyce's UlyssesBy Kevin BirminghamBy far the best book on JJ and Ulysses I ever read – you almost don't need a real biography after this. It's a total page turner. It's not an analysis, it's the story of how it was written and how it was published – long, painful and thrilling.2.James Joyce: Richard EllmanBut if you do want a big biography, this is the one.3.My Brother's Keeper: Stanislaus JoyceOr you could stick to this memoir by JJ's faithful brother. It will make you love JJ (and Stanny) a lot more than most books will.4.The New Bloomsday Book: Harry BlamiresI liked this not-too-scholarly voyage round & through & about Ulysses better than any other analysis/interpretation5.The Finnegans Wake Experience: Roland McHughI only read one book about FW. It was this. It's hilarious. Mr McHugh is a total obsessive with a screw loose & dedicated his whole waking being to reading FW correctly and then explaining how to read FW correctly. Elastic bands are an important part of the process as I recall. I think it was self published so might be hard to track down.6.James Joyce's Odyssey: Frank Delaney7.James Joyce's Dublin: Edward QuinnThese two are luxury items - gorgeous photo books full of black & white pix of dear dirty Dublin as it was and I don't think is anymore. Not essential but just a delight.AVOID1.Ulysses and Us: Declan Kiberd2.Ulysses on the Liffey: Richard EllmanThese two do exactly the same thing – with their jawbreakin pontificatin somnambulatin ramblin they like to make you want to find the English Literature department in your nearest university and burn it down.3.Ulysses Annotated: Don GiffordProving that the more you know the less you understand.***Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf's gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody's body.—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!\"How many roads must a man walk down....\"Sorry JJ, couldn't resist."

Oko njega sam samo okolišao, osluškivao priče i nisam znao šta da očekujem. Neki ga na mnoga vrata hvale, drugi kažu da je sumoran, a treći govore da treba hronološki čitati njegova djela, jer jedna vuku druga, i hvata nit sa svakom sljedećom. Doduše pokušao sam Portret umjetnika u mladosti, i misaono nisam bio spremn za nju. Pa sam tako tražio preludijum za istu. Odlučih se za ove kratke priče, jer bih svaki dan po jednu priču pročitao te tako pokušao da držim kakav-takav fokus. I ova zbirka priča me je zaista dirnula, kad sam je završio, poželih još.Umjetničke odlike ovih priča nisu samo po snazi već i po obuhvatnosti spremne da oslikaju sopstveni put, religijsko-konzervativni, sa primjesama piščevih afiniteta ogledanih u skrivenim poukama, u nerazjašnjenim i čudnovatim okolnostima. Svaki junak u priči je rastrzan nemirima, izgubljen u stvarima koje ga neprestano opkoljavaju, i kao takav grabi spas u nevidljivom. Džojsov senzibilitet je nesavremen, on hvata zalet za ono što krije ispod površine svog poetskog narativa. Svojim pričama Džojs kao da želi potonjim generacijama nešto da saopšti, da pomene i ukaže na trag predaka i tradicionalnog Dablina, sa svim svojim prednostima i manama. Džojs posvećuje svoje neumorno pregnuće ne bi li osokolio čitaoca ma koliko se nekada činilo da sve to provejava u nekim svojim unutrašnjim jazbinama."

        "user_review": "Why do we wish to live this life; life, which at times seem to accompany the vague impressions we have long since been comfortable to carry along; the ideas, the choices, which have become a second nature to us. How many times do we stop and think about them? Particularly, as readers, as the ones who have been challenged, and hence in a way made aware by written word; how many times do we stop and think - life cannot always be a search, it cannot always be a constant exploration into unknown, a desperate call to something which is striven for, for the attainment of something decisive. Or is it? Perhaps. But what when the decisive is attained, is conquered? Where does one go from there? Surely, in search of something still unknown, still unconquered! But we forget to stop in between. Or we rather choose to ignorethatwhich comes in between, because we are too afraid to stop. Andthatislife. I remember this very beautiful quote by Allan Saunders:\"Life is what happens to you when you are busy making other plans.\"We forget that sometimes, life is also the acceptance of that which is presented to us by mere chances, or more than that, by the long witnessed \"usual\".So, when I picked upDubliners, while still continuing withThe Rebel, I was at first annoyed because nothing seemed unusual or interesting there. But then, I just strove ahead because I had loved\"A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\"and so I wanted to give this a chance. Some more stories and I realized the simple idea with which these stories might have been penned. I realized that author might have wanted to portray life, as actually experienced and lived by the characters, who might in fact had been real people around him. People, who had lived a life, set by routine patterns and where nothing out of ordinary had ever happened. This realization made me sit straight and question myself. How many right ways can be there to live a life? One or two or more; Is it ours or theirs or still, somewhere between the two? I don't even know if these are the right options. But what I do understand is that, either way it is life we are talking about. Life which is lived, both consciously and unconsciously, which may be different in living but which in the end culminates into the same. Oh, but by this I do not undermine one way or the other but simply wish to express the value of understanding both.It was the last story of the collection i.e.\"The Dead\"which deeply touched and gave me more food for thought. It actually brought to eyes something unusual from the rest of the stories :) [See, the incorrigible me!] Gabriel, the protagonist of the story realized one day after a party that he didn't know much about his wife Gretta, who seemed to have been in love with someone else all along. The story is not only about this awareness but also about love which gets shattered, even when the man in question has been long dead, and signifies the end of life as lived by Gabriel.The story ends with snow falling:\"His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the Universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\"I do not doubt Joyce's genius as a writer. After reading \"Portrait\" and few pages of \"Ulysses\", this collection seemed just way too simplistic. But the thoughts it provoked after reading, is what makes it so readable.Definitely recommended."

        "user_review": "\"There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could do nothing in Dublin\"--Joyce\"Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.\"Dubliners is, by reputation (among English professors and scholars, at least) one of the greatest collections of short stories ever produced. Of course, as they say, them's fightin' words, so have it your own way, but I vote with that crowd of high admirers, and always have, having read it or stories from it, many times. This is the first time I am hearing it read aloud, in the appropriately Irish voice of Connor Sheridan, that somehow captures the dry and at sometimes mournful wit the ex-patriate Joyce brings to this tribute to the Dubliners he left behind. Some have found it maudlin, even grim, primarily a critique of the people Joyce left behind, but I found it at turns gently satirical, sometimes melancholy, and always loving, portraits of a time and place, filled with local politics and religion and (especially) finely sketched characters, some stories focused on lost opportunities for love or leaving.In 2000 Time Magazine listed the greatest novels of the twentieth century and listed the difficult English major Everest of Ulysses as the worthiest literary mountain to climb, #1, which prompted thousands of Americans who may never have read 100 novels to read the first three pages and promptly declare Joyce a boring and inscrutable idiot. Though I do think Ulysses is one of the greatest novels ever written, I don't think it would be particularly enjoyable for the general population; nor do I think most people \"should\" read it. But Joyce is an amazing writer; he wrote four works of fiction, in increasing levels of difficulty and formal experimentalism. If you like short stories and want to try Joyce I would try Dubliners, the most recognizably traditional stories he wrote. If you like that, I might then try the somewhat more formally challenging A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. If you decide to go to graduate school, then consider Ulysses, sure, but only then, which owes something mock-epic to Homer's Odyssey, and each chapter in a literary style of different periods/centuries. Finnegan's Wake, which took him twenty years to write, almost no one reads, for good reason. It is so experimental most people can't make heads or tails of a single paragraph. (No, I have not yet finished it, and probably never will).Dubliners, published in 1914 (after nearly ten years of his trying to get it published!), is short, as story collections go. I have my favorites: \"Eveline,\" about a young shop girl conflicted about leaving her widowed father to live life with a sailor:\"He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. She set her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition.\"And \"Araby,\" about a shy young man's fruitless pursuit of a young woman, dooming them both to loneliness.\". . . and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.\"\"Sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascent to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul's incurable loneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own.\"He's ambitious for her, but at the same time, he sees himself clearly and sadly: \"Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.\"Some of the deft observations of character in the writing are beautiful. Of one woman: \"She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed: and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male.\"And about Mr. Duffy: \"He lived at a little distance from his body, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glances. He had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a verb in the past tense.\"The true gem of the collection may be the magnificent and mournful closing long story, \"The Dead,\" which features Gabriel, asked to give a short speech in honor of his aunts at a holiday party, who is disappointed not to \"experience intimacy\" with his wife Greta after the party, seeing her sadly draped on the bed. A song that was sung at the party reminded her of a time when she was seventeen when she had loved a boy, Michael Furey, who lost his life in the war. Gabriel is jealous of a love she sees Greta had for this boy, a love that he and Greta have perhaps never had themselves. And then, this reflection, using snow to punctuate Gabriel's sense of himself and maybe Joyce's view of Dublin:\"A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.\"Proust wrote: \"In reality, when he reads, each reader is actually the reader of his own self. The work of the writer is nothing more than a kind of optical instrument that the writer offers. It allows the reader to discern that which, without the book, he might not have been able to see in himself.\"Do we not in our empathetic reading of Gabriel, see ourselves and reflect on our own lives?Many characters in Dubliners experience the struggle about whether to stay or leave, or to just act passionately, facing a kind of paralysis that Joyce refers to in the opening story, \"The Sisters\":\"I wanted real adventures to happen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.\" One must act, one must move, one must engage with the world, one must break free from provincial beliefs.Dubliners is a wonderful collection, short enough to read in a few hours. It's full of self-reflection and \"inwardness.\" Listen to it, read it. Some of the stories have been made into films, like John Huston's The Dead.Here's the whole story \"The Dead\" for you to read.

And somewhere in between there is a life. The first truancy, the first timid amorous sighs and all shades of greyness, whole stretches of the usual humdrum reality. People caught up in the daily routine, whom life was withheld.The workers, petty crooks and freeloaders, seamstresses, scullery maids, servants, scriveners, salesmen, union activists - the whole cross-section of Irish middle and lower-middle class. Some of them crave for money, some for other places, some for love while others for another times. And the more they're yearning the bigger is their disillusionment and discontent. Outcasts from life's feast.Boy fromAraby, enamoured of friend's sister wants to visit a charity bazaar and buy something for the girl to find finally the bazaar closed, hero ofCounterpartshaving pawned his watch, wants only to drink himself up but ends up with empty pockets and does not even feel drunk or Chandler, hero ofA little cloudwho's eagerly awaiting his old friend to find him only vulgar and patronizing. People unfulfilled, for whom an intemperance is something as inevitable as climate changes, who take out all their failures, pathetic fate and frustration on children and weaker than themselves. Who feel that if they want to achieve anything in life they have to leave this town behind, that in Dublin actually there is no life.And so Joyce did. But no matter how much had he abandoned Dublin, after all he took this city with himself forever. He loved and hated it, became a bard of Dublin and its inhabitants, a great admirer but its stern critic at the same time. The same sentiments had he for his homeland, often in his works calledErrorland.The main theme ofDublinersthat ties together all stories is the breakdown of all values, embodied in drunkenness, decadent debauchery, obscurantism of clergy, hypocrisy, intellectual primitivism of bourgeoisie, and finally paralysis of the Irish political scene after the death of Parnell.Joyce, chronicler of Dublin, alternately realistic and nostalgic, depicts city of lost hopes and failing chances to end this collection with absolutely brilliant storyThe Deadin which Gabriel counts on some pleasant moments with his wife, while she's yearning for her dead lover, and finally falling snow reconciles everything, covering equally the living and the dead."

        "user_review": "review update – 5/15/17The first twelve stories ofDublinerswere submitted to a publisher in 1905, when Joyce was 22. They were accepted, but squeamishness on the publisher's part kept delaying publication. Over the next three years Joyce submitted three additional stories. Finally he took the collection to a second publisher. Again it was accepted, and again it was held back. Finally, in 1914, the original publisher overcame his fears and released the volume to the public.By now, however, Joyce'sPortrait of the Artistwas appearing in a serialized version, and the novel overshadowed the short stories; as did, or course, Joyce's two modern masterpieces,UlyssesandFinnegan's Wake.So it was only slowly, over the course of many years, thatDublinersgained recognition for both the modernism and the rather brute realism of its stories.In the previous update, I chose to use the worddrearyin describing the stories. That they are. But this time let's try \"resignation\" – stories of resignation. This is perhaps better, since it's less ambiguous. Joyce writes about the people of Dublin as resigned to the lives they have – controlled by the Church (to some extent), controlled by the British (to the extent the British give a damn), prey to the simple pleasures of drink, having children, and pretending that life's not really so bad. And of course there are classes in this society, so that those of any class except the bottom can always compare themselves pridefully to those below them, should they care to.I scanned through the last, longest story (The Dead), looking for a good quotation. Alas, they were few and far between, and too long to bother with. But this story is a fit capstone to the collection. It's about a traditional New Year's Eve celebration that a few dozen of Dublin's better off citizens partake of, an evening of music, dancing, feasting. Nothing about anyone's death, though the protagonist, Gabriel, has rather morose thoughts often during the evening.Then in the last few pages, a tale of death finds its way into the story, a death that occurred long ago, but is newly revealed to Gabriel and causes him to have very quotable thoughts as he falls asleep. But, it occurred to me that the story's title refers not just to these last few pages, but to all the people celebrating that evening - Joyce suggesting that even these well fed, happy people, in failing to recognize the resignation with which they accept their lives, are in their own way, though \"living\", part of The Dead.review update - 3/17/15obviously in celebration of a certain dayJust a few thoughts on these stories a couple years later.When I said below that the stories aren't \"exciting\" ... yes, well, first I didn't mean that they were not very affecting stories, because some of them are. One could use the word \"depressing\"? But more, I think the atmosphere of the stories is probably much like the weather that I associate with the Emerald Isle. Damp, cloudy, hints of rain, chill in most parts of the year, maybe summerlike for a couple weeks in July. Gloomy. Weather that makes you seek out a pub and the warm comfort of a pint with friends. Then there's that Catholic haze that looms over everything, the haze and the weather and maybe even the people such that Joyce himself had to flee.Whenever you feel like subjecting yourself to this sort of dreariness, which should beoften, read one of the stories, it will suit your yearning.original reviewThese aren't the most exciting short stories ever written. They were written by Joyce, though, so that sets them on a level of Literature that most writers can only dream of. It also means that they are worthy of study, and that the time spent studying them will be well spent.Terence Brown's Introduction shows that he has studied these stories for a long time, and his Notes make it apparent that there is not a word, a slang term, a Dublin location, nor a historical reference in the stories that he does not know most everything about. (The footnoting is at times a bit distracting - \"of course, everyone knows that\" you think - but of course those things that \"everyone knows\" vary from reader to reader.) All in all, this is a very good edition ofDubliners.I was once an English lit. major in college (only for a year), and still have infrequent yearnings in that direction. One of those I have had in recent years is to take the time to write a long essay on these stories. I do think they are worth that kind of effort."

Just a short, yet meaningful interaction. Something with no responsibilities and no strings attached. And then, at some point, \"oh, it's two o' clock already, I'd better be going\". And that was it. One could argue that that's the case with all interactions in one's life.Joyce offers us a synthesis of people and their actions, their fears, their misconceptions, their loves and their hates. Brief zoom-ins into the details that make up Dublin of his time. I kind of lost myself there, drawing conclusions and finding meanings in symbolisms that could very well be anything but symbolisms. I think that's why many people didn't likeDubliners, and I think it's the same reason I did. Thought-provoking isn't it?"

I knew you could get me out.\" His brows went down even though his lids were lowered. \"I thought of you, too.\" \"You did?\" His chin moved up and down, and still she said, \"Really?\" \"Yeah. Some days... you were all I could think of.\"-Bella and ZOMG OMG OMG Can I please give this book more than 5 stars!! I just want to say that Lover Awakened is one of my top 5 favorite books of all times!!! I can't get enough! It's one of those books you read straight through and then when you finish it you wish you could delete it from your head so you can enjoy discovering it all over again. I loved Z so much. And as much as I loved Z I loved Bella too. I don't know how J.R. Ward does it but she somehow writes these books that bring to life this exciting, dark, and sexy world filled with heroes that I fall madly in love with. When you pick up one of the books in this series it looks like a normal book but when you open and read it it wraps around your heart and lives in your mind long after you finish it. This series is just amazing and this book is my favorite of the series!\"If you don't want to be with me, fine. Just say so. But don't hide behind wanting to protect me. You think I don't know the sex would be rough with you?\" \"Is that why you want it?\" he asked in a dead voice. \"You think you only deserve to be hurt now, after the lesser?\" She frowned. \"Not at all. But if that's the only way I can have you, then that's how I'll take you.\" He ran his hand back and forth over his skull trim, hoping the friction might get his brain to work. \"I think you're confused.\" He looked down at the floor. \"You have no idea what you're saying right now.\" \"You arrogant bastard,\" she snapped. Z's head shot up. Well, that was slap in the ass number two... \"Excuse me?\" \"Do us both a favor and don't try to think for me, okay? Because you're going to get it wrong every damn time.\" -Bella and ZHe wanted to see her eat. After the sex, after he came inside of her, he wanted to have her eat food he'd brought her, and he wanted her to take the stuff from his hand. Hell, he wanted to go out and kill something for her, bring the meat back, cook it himself, and feed her until she was full. Then he wanted to lie beside her with a dagger in his hand, protecting her as she slept.-ZMy God I ached for Z. Zsadist was so tortured, scarred, totally badass, and sexy as hell. The first time I read this book Z crawled into my heart and he has lived there ever since. He was just such an amazing and deep hero. Something that really made me mad in this book and the two books before this one was the way everyone treated Z. All the Brothers including Z's own twin Phury acted like he was a ruined, nonredeemable, crazy, evil, pos. Everyone always jumped to bad conclusions about him and no one really cared for him. I don't feel Phury really loved him. To Phury Z was just a burden. It pissed me off so bad the way Phury especially treated him. Z was so left out and all alone. All the flash backs into Z's past and reading how he felt about himself damn but my heart just bled for him. I loved Bella because she was strong, brave, loyal, sassy, and she fought for her man. She went through six weeks of hell at the hands of the Lesser David but he didn't break her. I would have loved her alone just for the way she loved Z. She seen his worth and beauty when everyone else treated him like he was a wild animal.\"I mean, why? Of all the males you could have, why me?\" \"I want you.\" She put her hand on his chest. \"It's a natural, normal response to the opposite sex, isn't it?\" \"I'm not normal.\" \"I know. But you're not dirty or contaminated or unworthy.\"-Z and Bella\"Oh, God… Zsadist, I love you.\" His eyes flared so wide, his brows nearly hit his hairline. \"What… ?\" \"I love you.\" \"Say that again.\" \"I love you.\" \"Again… please,\" he whispered. \"I need to hear it… again.\" \"I love you…\"-Bella and ZTogether Bella and Z had a beautiful and emotional love story. I loved the way Bella needed only Z. He was her rock, her safety, and her hero! And Bella showed Z that he wasn't dirty or ugly but strong, sexy, and an male of worth. Their love story is why I read romance novels. The powerful connections I feel for them. The way their story makes me feel when I read it. Like they are real. The happiness their book brings me is why I enjoy reading so much. My God I melted when Z and Bella made love. Z discovering the beauty of love making after what he had been through was so moving. They are one of my top 5 favorite couples ever. Though this is Bella and Z's book there was so much going on in this book. Especially with John, Tohr, and Wellsie. I enjoyed all the stuff about John adjusting to his new life, finding out his bloodline, and bonding with Z. But OMFG whenWellsie died I cried. Tohr losing his shit over her death and then disappearing was just so damn heartbreaking. OMGI was all over the place in this book. But my main feels was love. Love for Z, love for Bella, love for their relationship, love for John, love for Butch just lots of love. I will say that I wish there was less Lesser time in this book. I didn't wanna spend that much time reading about the bad guys I wanted more time with Z and Bella. The End of the book was total icing on my cake. I swooned over the epilogue. This book is love story perfection!\"I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came... and I was awakened.\"-Z"

        "user_review": "\"I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came… and I was awakened.\"Beautiful.Don't know what more to say about this book.Amazing and beautiful and those 5 stars don't do it justice.Z is definitely my favorite BDB Brother <3\"He couldn't stand to have anyone put their hands to him…though he wished he'd let Bella find a piece of his flesh just once. With her, he might have been able to handle it.\"The story**this will be spoilerish to everyone who hasn't read the first two books**Six weeks has passed since Bella's kidnapping, and Zsadist has become more and more violent. He has only one goal: kill as many lessers as he can, and find out what happened to Bella.The Brotherhood is worried about him, and they have no clue why he's taken a personal interest to Bella, but then, it's not like anyone understands him at all.When a call comes with information that Bella is still alive, Z almost goes crazy because he has to wait for nightfall to go to her.The rescue... Won't talk about that, you have to experience it by yourself :(The real story begins there, Z wants Bella badly, but he knows she shouldn't be with him, even though she refuses to leave his side.Will he be able to set himself free of his past, with Bella's help?Read and see <3\"He was terrifying, a horror of her species. Ruined, not broken, in the words of his twin. But that was what would have made him such a good savior. He alone was a match for the lesser who'd taken her. Zsadist's kind of brutality was probably the only thing that could have gotten her out, though she knew better than to think that he'd ever try to find her.\"The story- Heartbreaking. Just totally is. Even though we see the HEA, Z's past and all he went through... :(((But it was so wonderful to watch him heal, get past it, all with Bella's help... Amazing <3The rescue scene was one of the most emotional ones for me, and my favorites were when Z was taking care of her <3When his eyes changed! One of the best scenes ever <3And then the mirror scene with the brothers! Loved it so much!Well damn, I pretty much loved the whole book, except the lesser parts!The flashbacks- There are flashbacks to Zsadist's and Phury's history in this book, and those scenes are tough and disturbing, when he was a blood/sex slave and when Phury rescued him. Not easy to read, but we learn so much about both of them, and why they're the way they are.The characters- There is a lot of John Matthew in this book, we see him adapting to his new life, and living with Tohr and Wellsie :)Butch and Marissa are going in circles, but nothing really happening between them.We meet Rehvenge, Bella's brother, who will have his own book later :)Phury has a very big role here, he's in love with Bella too, so we get to see his jealous and self-sacrificing side.Tohrment... My heart goes out to him.The sex- Well, you have to know that Z has a lot of baggage, being a sex slave for decades, and it isn't easy seeing him opening up to Bella, trying stuff, and ultimately having sex with her. Not the usual \"OMG this is so hot I'm going to combust\" type of scenes, just to warn you. But they are amazing, and very emotional! Just seeing him letting go of his fear... Yep, definitely worth it <3 But yeah there'll be the combustible scenes later on ahahah :DDDOh… God. What was a male supposed to do in this situation?\"I'm sorry,\" he muttered. \"If I… uh, hurt your feelings or something.\"She glared at him. \"I'm not hurt. I'm pissed off and sexually frustrated.\"Bella has been held for six weeks by a deranged lesser maniac person, endured lots of horrible stuff, and thought she would die there without anyone knowing what happened to her.After she is rescued, she clings to Z and doesn't want to leave him.It takes her some time to realise what happened to Z when he was a slave, and she wants to help him get over it.As the book goes on, Bella falls in love with Zsadist (of course), and she happens to find herself in a terrible situation where she needs his help badly...\"When I said I won't apologize for it, I meant I never regret killing those bastards. But I didn't…I don't like you having those images in your head. I'd take them from you if I could. I'd take all of this from you…bear it all for you. I'm so…fucking sorry this happened to you, Bella. Yeah, I'm just sorry about the whole thing, including…me.\"Bella comes with baggage herself, although, not as serious as Z, but it's still there. The torture and everything she endured while in captivity is something she can't forget, and Z is the only person she trusts enough to be around.She is very insecure in herself, after Z constantly pushes her away, thinking there's a problem with her, that he is repulsed by her now. It was very hard to read, I really felt sorry for her :(But just love the scene when shecame to the floor to sleep beside him <3It was just so sweet because of what Z did <3Anyway, she doesn't know exactly what happened with Z, and he doesn't want to tell her, so that leads to a lot of difficult situations when she pushes him too far out of his comfort zone :(((But still, it's all worth it when we see thebonding and when he finally realises he loves her <3Beautiful scenes!\"He was the cold that made her condense into herself again. And the heat that stopped her from shivering.He was the killer who made her safe.\"\"He thought about all the holes in him, the blank places, the voids where others felt things. When it came down to it, he was really just a screen, more empty than solid, his emotions blowing through him, only the anger catching and holding.\"Zsadist is a killer, emotionless and cold. He doesn't care about anything or anyone, even the Brotherhood doesn't trust him.He is scarred, inside and out. He wears piercings and has slave bands tattooed on his neck and arms.Not a fuzzy one, that Z.It all goes back to when he was being held as a blood slave, and was being sexually used as well. His mistress was a b*tch from hell, and with what he went through... No freaking wonder he turned out that way :(He hates sex and anything sexual because it reminds him of that woman, and he thinks himself unclean and unworthy of Bella, even though he is fiercely protective of her, and wants to have her for himself.He tries to push her toward Phury, even though it kills him, but he wants her with a male of worth, someone who he could've been.Still, we get to see him heal, all thanks to Bella, and the change in him is remarkable <3\"He knew he was being overbearing as hell, but he couldn't help it.He was a bonded male. With his pregnant female.There were few things on the planet more aggressive or dangerous. And those bastards were called hurricanes and tornadoes.\"I can't say how much I love Z. He's definitely my favorite brother <3He goes through a full transformation here, and it was just beautiful to see.First, when he was pining for Bella in her house. He wouldn't call it that way ahahha but it looked like it to me :)Poor guy, and then the rescue, even though she was the one who was wronged and endured terrible things, I still felt terrible for Z in that scene :(Later on, every protective thing he did concerning Bella had me swooning and sighing and wanting to cry and hug him like crazy <3He fought it all the way, pushed Bella away from him almost all the time, even though he terribly wanted to be with her :(Like I said before, his biggest problem was him feeling unworthy of Bella, and everything he did was because of it. So, so sad :(((But this book really was all about him, how he changed completely, by overcoming his fears and insecurities, and becoming the person who he was supposed to be.The ending, with the paper <3End the epilogue!!!Best! Ever <3\"Phury... what happened to me?\"As the male came up behind him, his brother's face appeared right beside Z's. And then Wrath's dark reflection showed up in the mirror, all long hair and sunglasses. Then Rhage's star-fallen beauty. And Vishous's Sox cap. And Tohrment's brush cut. And Butch's busted nose.One by one they reached out and touched him, their big hands gently on his shoulders.\"Welcome back, my brother,\" Phury whispered.Zsadist stared at the males who were behind him. And the oddest thought that if he were to let himself go limp and fall backward... they would catch him.My favorite quotes from other characters:\"That female who'd walked in on him and the Reverend clearly had a big mouth and…Christ. Butch must have already told Vishous. The two were like an old mated couple, no secrets between them. And V would squeal to Rhage. And once Rhage knew, you might as well have popped the news flash on the Reuters wire.\"\"The snow falls slowly tonight,\" V said, rubbing his thumb back and forth over a thick jugular vein.Phury blinked as an odd calm came over him, his heart slowing to the rhythm of his brother's thumb. \"What?\"\"The snow…it falls so slowly.\"\"Yes…yes, it does.\"\"And we've had a lot of snow this year, haven't we?\"\"Uh…yes.\"\"Yeah…lot of snow, and there's going to be more. Tonight. Tomorrow. Next month. Next year. The stuff comes when it comes and falls where it will.\"\"That's right,\" Phury said softly. \"There's no stopping it.\"\"Not unless you're the ground.\" The thumb stopped. \"My brother, you don't look like the earth to me. You're not stopping him. Ever.\"\"Oh, man,\" he said with more gravel than voice. Then he glanced at Vishous, who was passed out next to him. \"Oh…man, this is too weird.\"\"Get over yourself, cop. You're not that attractive.\"\"Butch? Maybe you could…call on me.\"\"Why would I do that?\"She flushed and seemed to wilt. \"I had hoped…\"\"Hoped what?\"\"That perhaps…\"\"What?\"\"You might call on me. If you had some time. Perhaps you could come…calling.\"\"Outside of the office, Phury put John down and held him in place. There was a moment or two of silence…and then a raw scream shattered the air as sure as if the oxygen were a solid.The burst of energy that followed was so strong it shattered the glass door. Shards splintered and sprayed out while Phury sheltered John from the shrapnel.One by one down both lengths of the hall, the fluorescent ceiling lights exploded, flashing bright and leaving streamers of sparks to bleed down from the fixtures. Energy vibrated up through the concrete floor, leaving cracks that ran into the cinder-block walls.Through the busted door John saw a whirlwind in the office, and the Brothers were backing away from it, arms in front of their faces. Pieces of furniture whipped around a black hole in the center of the room, one that was vaguely shaped like Tohr's head and body.\"\"I've only ever had you to live for. If you die I have nothing. I'm utterly lost. And you are needed here.\"Zsadist tried to reach out, but couldn't lift his arms as Phury stood up.\"God, Z, I keep thinking this tragedy of ours is going to be over. But it just keeps going, doesn't it?\"Verily, the most beautiful book ever. <3"

        "user_review": "My dear friend Karla and I went on this emotional roller coaster of a ride together. It was so much fun and I enjoyed every minute! Her unique way with words and her humor kept me in stitches. Thank you sweet Karla for reading this with me and to all our friends for their encouragement along the way!Whew...What a story! There is no way I can do a review and do justice to this book. Zsadist's story was everything and more that I was told. I have fallen hard for another one of JRW's brothers! Below are just a few of my thoughts/feelings.Zsadist is without a doubt one of the most tortured heroes I've read. He broke me. My heart shattered. His deep feelings of unworth tore me to shreds! His self loathing is palpable and the intense anguish he endures each day left me in pain. His intense self hatred at times was difficult to read.As the author reveals his past in small portions, my heart ached more. And when all was told, a nursery rhyme came to mind, Humpty Dumpty...all shattered to pieces never to be put together again. No, I promise I didn't relate this warrior with the fat egg, only the results of their fall. I soon learned the horrifying scar he wears on his face is nothing compared to his inner anguish.\"Ruined, not broken\" ----Heartbreaking words issued as a warning to the heroine, Bella, to stay clear of this brother!And what a heroine! Bella is so easy to love and I admired her inner strength and her determination.Portions of their story are absolutely sizzling hot and heart wrenching! It had me crying, laughing, cursing, holding my breath in fear, gasping in awe, and at times, fighting mad! But Oh my, what a love story! Intense, hot, emotional, tender; unfortunately, their love is fraught by Z's demons!In addition to Zsadist and Bella's story, this book is slam full to the brim! There is a heart breaking scene that had me in tears, and I mean crying heartbroken tears! I was even mad at the author! I also learned how much one can hate a lesser! I wanted to pouf him out of their world myself!! And OMGosh, the love I have for Phury, who is Zsadist's twin brother! The sacrifices he made is a beautiful thing and there is one particular scene that I nearly cried buckets! And what's up with V and Butch andthat drink?I must read Butch's story next! And last but in no way least, there is a scene that had me gulping in total, shocked, didn't see that coming surprise!While this was an amazing, intense and emotional read, and one that I loved, I needed more Zsadist and Bella alone time. I felt there just wasn't enough intimacy given to this couple, especially toward the end. Also, while I loved the epilogue, I wished for more.Thanks again sweet Karla! It was so much fun sharing our thoughts and feelings along the way:) *Hugs* ♥A great big thank you to my dear friends Dhes, Dorsey, Jaynie and Dee who encouraged me to start this series! I am totally hooked and off to Butch's story:)!One of my fav pics of Zsadist and Bella....."

I don't give a damn what you think! Oh, and by the way, I don't like you either!\"Just so you know.Sooooo. This wasridiculous, stupid and boring. Wait, I think I'm forgetting something here. Oh yeah, it waspretty lame, too. I think it's high time to get my favourite antediluvian beast out of extinction:Good doggy.Believe it or not, the main problem with thisthingbook is NOT that it is PNR. Well, as 99.99% of PNR novels, it is indeedsilly and OTT and slightly ridiculous. But that's to be expected in thissilly and OTT and slightly ridiculousgenre.A note to all you adorable PNR trolls out there: this is not a bad thing in itself. Unlike this literary masterpiece here, some books can actually be silly, OTT, ridiculous and NOT STUPID. They can even be entertaining sometimes. I kid you not. So the answer to the question you didn't ask is: yes, I am aware that thisthingbook never pretended to be deep and complex and à la quantum physics. Doesn't mean it had to be this crappy, though.Now, themain problemwith this delightful story? ItsBogus Alpha Asshole MC(BAAM™), aka Z. aka Zsadist (if, like me, you think his name is somewhat stupid and vaguely laughable, please feel free to eyeroll here). So the guy is supposed to be thissuper antisocial, twisted, sick bastardwho rejoices in being atotal prick24/7 and supposedly loves nothing better thaninflicting pain.J.R. Ward, you areso damn funny. BecauseZ the Counterfeit Sadist(ZtCS™) is nothing but abig, pathetic, woe-is-me cry baby with the mushy heart of a 13 year old schoolgirl. I swear, the guy is an insult to all theGloriously Fucked up, Slightly Unhinged, Mentally Unstable Jerks(GFUSUMUJ™) currently living in peace and harmony in my High Security Harem. Shame on you for creatingone of the most ridiculous characters in the history of ridiculous characters, J.R. Ward. Luckily enough for you, Fleet Admiral DaShrimp and the Murderous Crustacean Troops (MCT™) are away on holiday at the moment (they are visiting their decapodic cousins in the South Seas), so I can't unleash them on you. BUT I do have a fewfluffybunniesmercenarieson my payroll. Not impressed, are you? Well don't let their disgusting cuteness kill you. These little guys are devious, ruthlessfuckersfiends withdeliciously homicidal tendencies. So if I were you I'd start running now. FAST.And that is all. Well, it's not really all, but I've wasted enough time with this thing as it is. Besides, the story is yourbasic, standard PNR crap, so there isn't much to say about it. Well I could tell you that it issilly and OTT and ridiculous and slightly stupid, but I think I might have already said that, so it's better if I don't repeat myself, right?Right.»And the moral of this Fantastically Fascinating Non-Review(FFNR™) is: this is it. I've had it. I am done done done trying to commit PNR-induced suicide.Yes, that's right,the divorce is finaland the masochist in me has finally decided to give up on thispatheticcharming genre. Except ifIlona Andrews,Pippa DaCosta,Glen CookorCraig Schaeferdecide to tackle it, that is. Unfortunately, that seemsa bit unlikely. But you never know, a crustacean can hope. Oh, and by the way, I reserve the right to read books byVeronica Del Rosa, too. Because the girl wouldn't know how to writeharebrained PNReven if she tried.The end. You're welcome. And stuff.✉To the threelovely ladiesnutcaseswho collectively recommended I read this thing: it was nice knowing you. I'm sorry you have to die such aslow, horrible, painful death.•Book 1:Dark Lover★★★★★•Book 2:Lover Eternal★★"

        "user_review": "Oh. My. God.I'm not even sure I can convey the complete absurdity of this book. Any description I try to make is typically interrupted by my own peals of laughter at the general ridiculousness and/or groans of immense pain.The hero, Zsadist-- yes, he is actually named that-- is a self-proclaimed misogynist. (Yayz!) Profoundly psychologically damaged after several years of torture, abuse and slavery at the hands of an evil female vampire, he spends most of his time moping about, feeling angry, and hating his gignormous penis for causing all this trouble. He likes to beat himself to get off, but then he hates himself for getting off. Then he falls in love with Bella and moans a lot about his evil sperm, how dirty he is, and blah blah blah. Meanwhile, our heroine stands placidly by (of course), feels compelled to love him despite his faults (of course), and gradually tames the beast within-- after several rounds of rather rough sex (of course). We also get some lovely flashbacks to Zsadist being tortured and abused (of course).Seriously, this reads like the worst of fan fiction AUs brought together. The other male leads have names like \tVishous, Phury and Rhage and this is not supposed to be take as comedy and/or irony??? Also, the soliloquies where Zsadist is hating on his penis are pretty amazing.Also, the universe! ZOMG, it is so freaking complicated. Vampires! Vampire slayers! Vampire protectors! Vampire drug addicts! Seriously, there are guide books sold to help readers understand this universe! Clearly, this is the romance industry's version of Anne Rice and Laurel K. Hamilton. Clearly it has been very successful as a crossover money maker. But really, really: W.O.W."

        "user_review": "5 THOUSAND BELOVED-NALLA STARS!!!I've read this book countless times, but this is my first review. Zsadist is my 5th favorite book man ever!!!...even though his face was harsh, his voice was so soft and beautiful, like the candle flame.A dark musk with an evergreen spice.My Zsadist:Zsadist is a tortured soul, the darkest of the Brothers, the meanest. After spending a hundred years as a blood and sex slave, he has nothing left to give anyone, and he can barely stay alive for himself. He has survivedpain, mental anguish, cringing depths of humiliation and degradation, hopelessness, helplessness.Z is my favorite kind of man. He is scary shit, and I dig it. He is beyond saving, and he doesn't want to be saved. He is HILARIOUS!!! Humor is my #1 favorite attribute in any man, especially sarcastic humor. I laugh at (almost) everything Z says. The other stuff he says just shreds my heart.Z had no love to give anyone. But the hatred he had he would channel for Bella until the last breath left his lungs.Bella is aHEROine!!!! She saves Zsadist from himself. She saves Zsadist from death. She is devoted to him whole-heartedly and fights through all of his darkness. She is his constant.My Bella:Bella is drawn to Z, and she decides that she wants him, and when Bella makes a decision, it's final!!! I love her devotion to Z!! She is so confident and has such courage that she is the perfect match for him.He was the killer who made her safe.Their love is...Gah!!! It's push and pull. There isn't another love like theirs. He pushes her away so many times, but he cannot resist her love because she gives so much of herself to him.\"I love you.\"Z squeezed his eyes shut. \"Don't be a tragedy, Bella.\"\"Don't make me go,\" she whispered.He was going to take her with all the strength he had, and she was going to be sore when he was through using her. Sore and utterly blissed out. She couldn't wait.I LOVE the ending to this book! It has me up on my feet pumping my fist in the air! I love Z to death, but Bella makes this book so much better, and she contributes her own badass-ness to this ending!In conclusion...I love Zsadist!!!!"

        "user_review": "Opening Line:\"Goddamn it, Zsadist! Don't jump--\"~ZSADIST YOU BROKE MY HEART~This is an amazing book and my favourite in the series. LOVER AWAKENED tells the agonizingly painful story of Zsadist, a former blood slave and most feared member of the Blackdagger Brotherhood. After Zsadist rescues the beautiful, aristocrat Bella from the Lessoning Society's torture facility she refuses to leave his side (or bed.) Craving the strength and security she now finds only with him. And it's with her growing love and patience that this reluctant hero ultimately `awakens'. It's a bumpy ride for our pair and this relationship will leave you in tears, both of joy and sadness as we witness Z's transformation from the `cold one' into a male of worth. A multilayered novel L.A of course has several stories and POV's running simultaneously and the action never stops. Full of suspense, erotic and ultimately heartbreaking.Introduced briefly in the past two books, we now get to find out what made Zsadist the way he is. A confirmed sociopath who avoids all relationships, Z is scarred, pierced, tattooed, violent and illiterate. He's the most feared Brother and distrusted by all because of his intimidating and just downright mean nature. He enjoys pain yet can't bare any kind of physical contact due to the years of physical and sexual abuse he suffered during his time as a blood slave. Zsadist makes for an unlikely romantic hero but JR brilliantly gains your sympathy and you will grow to love this misunderstood and abused character.Phury as Zsadist's twin plays a major role here, and through a series of flashbacks we learn the details of Z's enslavement and Phury's daring rescue of him. It's a striking scene resulting in the loss of his leg and Z's brutal scarring. Phury has spent his life consumed with fixing his twin and is riddled with guilt, sacrificing time and again and it's starting to take a toll. Now exhausted, he's playing a deadly game with the `red smoke' and despite his vow of celibacy can't help being attracted to Bella.We also get to know Rehvenge the Sympath club owner of Zerosum and John Mathew's story starts to unfold as he begins his training and accepts the love of a family. Of course all the Brothers get some attention so we get shots of Wrath, Rhage, Vishous, Butch and their respective `Shellans.' Some of my favourite scenes involve the Brothers just going about their daily business, little interludes in the kitchen, or hanging out playing pool and teasing each other. Unfortunately the Lessers continue their torment making things personal now as their leader Mr. O attempts to reclaim Bella and a shocking loss occurs within the Brotherhood family that will be felt throughout the rest of this series.Z and Bella's love story takes center stage throughout though and is utterly fascinating. From the moment of rescue Zsadist won't let anyone else near Bella. And despite being frightened of him she wants him. To Bella he is perfect and she slowly begins to seduce him. Z is subsequently terrified, feeling dirty and hating his body's response to her. When the two finally kiss however...sigh. Ultimately Z's feelings of unworthiness force him to push her away. Into the arms of a male of worth, those of his twin brother. When Bella goes into her 'needing' though which twin will ease her suffering? The celibate one or the one who can't bear to be touched?The climax of this book is simply unput-downable. With a suicide mission forcing one twin to sacrifice everything for the life of the other and a HEA that brings tears to your eyes as we get a rare glimpse of the future. Each book in this series just gets better and better but JR has outdone herself here. I would give this more *s if I could and can't recommend it enough"

His tortured, scarred soul creates such an amazing character and the way he falls in love with Bella is beautiful.For me, this was one of those books that sucks you in and makes you forget and/or ignore everything else around you. I was absolutely enthralled and literally saddened when it was over."

        "user_review": "Jesus, I hated Zsadist before this book. I thought of him as a ruthless killer, and he is. But there is another side of him that is revealed in this book. With Bella, Zsadist's tortured soul is exposed. You see a much darker side of him that is painful and I feel ashamed to say that I am captivated by him. Knowing him, that is the last thing he would want. Zsadist has no patience for those who show sympathy or pity him. And I respect him more for that.This is one of the more darker books of the series. It's content is brooding and involves a lot of self-loathing. A lot of Phury's story is told here as well. Damn, the thing he goes through for his brother... I can't even imagine his pain. Now I can see why in Lover Enshrined he is such a mess. But God bless him for his efforts. He is a good male. Both of them are.And Wellsie. Poor woman. The hurt that Tohr and John must feel... I still cannot believe it.Also, John seems to be growing up already in this book. In the last few pages I found myself saying, \"Good for him\" as he picked up those weapons and practiced with them.Ward does an amazing job fitting happiness and sorrow and pain all together to create a delicious mix that is consumed by all. This series is to die for."

Zsadist is a real tortured hero. What he has been through shatters my heart. And Bella, she is a savior of this broken man. She has fire in her heart, especially when he tries to push her away, she resists. That's why I love her. That's why I love this book so damn much !\"He knew he was being overbearing as hell, but he couldn't help it. He was a bonded male. With his pregnant female. There were few things on the planet more aggressive or dangerous. And those bastards were called hurricanes and tornadoes.\"I cried many times while I was reading. Z has a soft heart if I stare hard enough. He think he was broken by his former master, so he doesn't deserve anything.\"She is more beautiful than I have words for. And last night, I was blessed beyond measure to serve her.\"J.R. Ward mastered this book immaculately from the start to the end. She slowly built my anticipation for this book in the previous ones. My hope was too high before reading this, and she didn't make me down even a little. Lover Awakened is beyond perfection. It's a masterpiece. It's a jem. It's everyting I could have asked for.https://goo.gl/hPuahO"

        "user_review": "4 1/2 stars\"Everyone\" has already read this book, so I'm just going to rant a bit...Zsadist had me intrigued since I readDark Lover, because he was pretty much an outcast within the Brotherhood and I knew there had to be something \"good\" inside him. I also knew that his story would be \"scary\" (for lack of a better word) and, boy, I was not mistaken! I thoughtSin MacAllisterfromKinley MacGregor'sBorn in Sinwas the most tortured hero in Romancelandia but, compared to Z's, Sin's life was a merry walk in the park. Z's mind was so twisted that, for a moment, I doubted the possibility of a believable HEA for him. I shouldn't have, though. Can I just say I loved the epilogue? :)Bella was everything Z needed. She had been attracted to him since they first met inLover Eternaland, for reasons he couldn't understand, he also felt a strong connection to her. When presented with the chance to be with Z, Bella was honest and direct about it - and I congratulated her for it. But then,Z told her to go away in the end and, instead of fighting for them, she just complied!?!Not what I expectedfrom a woman/vampire who had just killed her kidnapper,but that gave room for the wonderful scene with Z writing her that sigh-worthy note, so I guess I can excuse that.Now, Phury... Call me insensitive but, at this point, I almost despise him. I was probably supposed to embrace him as a larger-than-life, altruistic man/vampire, but he just came across as a pathetic loser - not to mention, drug addict - to me. Get a life, my brother!And Tohr... Why, oh why did Ms. Ward feel the need to do that to him? Didn't we have enough wild and wrecked Brothers? Couldn't we haveat least one\"normal\" guy among them? Based on some comments I'd heard before reading this book, I knewWellsie was going to die,but that didn't make me less unhappy when the time came.As it happened in the previous book,Lover Eternal, I didn't care for the scenes with thelessersin this book either and I wish Ms. Ward stopped giving them so much \"screen time\". I know I don't stand a chance of seeing this happening, so I guess this series will never get a 5-star rating for me. Oh well, it isn't like that would make any difference, because these books have already a gazillion rabid fans and I won't be missed, LOL."

There are multiple scene breaks in every/almost every chapter and none of them are delineated from each other so it goes from one scene/character to the next without any additional spaces to give an expected and needed visual indication that you've just hopped from Zsadist's freezing bedroom to the locker room with John Matthew being bullied by Lash.Italmostmakes me think I could/would/should threaten to never reread it ever again but that would be a weak ass lie.Zsadist and Bella get all the heart eyes.---[original review]----Oh, my sweet peas and carrots! I lost count on how many times the bottom on my stomach dropped out and sank somewhere down by my feet only to bungee jump right back up and fly straight through the top of my head in sheer delight. Oh yes, this book wasdee-licious!I got married in July 2008 and brought the first two books in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series to keep myself amused on the honeymoon flight. They were cracktastic and addictive and fun and I eagerly added the next title to my queue on booksfree.com (the site I've been relying on ever since I put myself on an economical and restrictive book diet that prohibits the purchase of books I won't reread). Fast forward to October 2008 and I'mstill waitingfor Lover Awakened, the third book in the BDB series.The availability of this book has never been on track for the rate that I have returned books and others were repeatedly bumped to the top and sent out instead. Things were getting serious and I was going into some major BDB withdrawal but I lucked out recently when a friend graciously offered to lend me not only this book, but also the fourth, fifth and sixth in the series (thanks Jen!)And now that I've finally had a chance to read this installment, it comes as no surprise that the waiting list is so long. This book is beyond hot!Zsadist is one twisted mofo and I've beenextremelycurious as to how Ward was going to portray him in a way that would make me sympathize with his unusual tastes. Personally, I think it was a success. Zsadist was a perfect blend of anger, dementia,anger, anger, terror, anger, confusion…and…and…timid tenderness? Which, wow, totally floored me.***spoilers past this point***The second book in this series, Lover Eternal, had bothered me for several reasons, one being that the author spent waaaay too much time building up for number three and left a cliffhanger completely neglected at the very end of number two. To me, a cliffhanger means ending the book with an unsatisfying shocker that leaves your reader nearly in pain but eager for the next installment (ie Karen Marie Moning's Fever series which I'm still twitching in anticipation for!) But in Lover Eternal, the fact that Bella had been kidnapped by a bad guy and had not yet been recovered isnot even mentionedat the very end. Instead, Rhage and Mary go on to have their own piss-poor happily ever after and to be quite frank, the fact that they never even mentioned Bella's kidnapping or even expressed some concern over their friend's predicament cheapened both of them as individuals in my eyes.Fortunately this one was totally different. Bella was rescued. Bella was messed up. Bella had a freaky new tattoo. Bella decided Zsadist's room was the only place she'd feel safe (hmm). Zsadist tweaked out. Zsadist had complete meltdowns on numerous occasions and when Bella finally leaned in and kissed him for the very first time, I almost fell off the couch. It was that good.Also of noteworthy mention is that the number of times the word \"shitkickers\" appeared in this novel's pages was significantly down (thank god). The number of times one Brother said to another Brother, \"bla bla bla bla bla bla, true?\" was down (what a relief). And references to rap artists I don't listen to was also down (yesssss!) Overall, I think this book was a complete success and I need to own a copy I can love and cherish forever. I love crack laced with rat poison!"

Flipping the spiral notebook to a new page, he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while. Then he ripped the sheet free.His hand was shaking as he held it out. \"It's messy.\"Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOUHer lips flattened tight as her eyes stung. The handwriting got wavy and then disappeared.\"Maybe you can't read it,\" he said in a small voice. \"I can do it over.\"She shook her head. \"I can read it just fine. It's… beautiful.\"\"I don't expect anything back. I mean… I know that you don't… feel that for me anymore. But I wanted you to know. It's important that you knew. And if there's any chance we could be together… I can't stop my job with the Brotherhood. But I can promise that I'll be so much more careful with myself—\" He frowned and stopped talking. \"Shit. What am I saying? I promised myself I wouldn't put you in this position—\"She crushed the paper to her heart, then launched herself at him, hitting his chest so hard he stumbled back. As his arms came around her with hesitation, as if he didn't have any idea what she was doing or why, she wept openly.In all her preparations for this meeting, the one thing she had never considered was that the two of them might have some sort of future.When he tilted up her chin and looked down at her she tried to smile, but the crazy hope she felt was too heavy and joyous a burden.\"I didn't mean to make you cry—\"\"Oh, God… Zsadist, I love you.\"His eyes flared so wide, his brows nearly hit his hairline. \"What… ?\"\"I love you.\"\"Say that again.\"\"I love you.\"\"Again… please,\" he whispered. \"I need to hear it… again.\"\"I love you…\"His response was to start praying to the Scribe Virgin in the Old Language.Holding Bella tight, burying his face in her hair, he gave thanks with such eloquence she started to weep all over again.When the last laudation had been murmured he switched back into English. \"I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came… and I was awakened.\"Doing a re-read 04/09/2012I just read this part:\"I've only ever had you to live for. If you die I have nothing. I'm utterly lost. And you are needed here.\"Zsadist tried to reach out, but couldn't lift his arms as Phury stood up.\"God, Z, I keep thinking this tragedy of ours is going to be over. But it just keeps going, doesn't it?\"And I sobbed harder this time reading it than I did almost exactly 3 years ago when I read it the first time.I adore Zsadist. He is, by far, my favorite brother. Tormented, he has given up on finding love, believing himself both unworthy and unlovable."

And it's Zsadist. I am Zsadist.\"(From Lover Eternal)This is how Bella and Zhadist were introduced and one thing that you have to learn about the BDB is that all the books are connected somehow. So, when you open Lover Awakened, you will realize that the two main characters have already started their love fairytale in the previous book and in Lover Awakened, they will be finally together.It will not be easy for them to be together, because Bella is missing. Someone has stolen Bella and Zhadist is going mad trying to discover where she is and if she is alive.When Zhadist finally saves Bella, their relationship will have another major problem which is Zhadist himself. Although born a warrior, Zhadist had spent the majority of his previous life as a sex slave of a ruthless, sadistic mistress. It was the only thing that he knew until he was saved by his brother Phury. Now, he mainly uses females for feeding – not for loving.On the other hand Bella has grown up as a pampered princess. She would most probably have been already married to a male of aristocracy, but she liked her loneliness.The tortured scarred inside and outside male has nothing in common with astonishingly beautiful Bella. And this fact does not really matter. Because when Bella needs him the most during her \"needing\", he will be there for her. And he will be more than willing.Zhadist and Bella is one the favorite couples in Black Dagger Brotherhood. If I am not mistaken, I think it is Ward's favorite couple as well. Their love story will not be an easy ride. It may have a happy ending in this book, but later on there will be doubts and fear and Zhadist's self loathing which doesn't go away easily.Nevertheless, Zhadist and Bella have one of the strongest bonds in comparison to the other couples.Goodbye Wellsie..."

        "user_review": "LOVER AWAKENED is hands down my favorite book so far in the BDB series. Zsadist is such a tortured soul and I was just itching to get his and Bella's story from their first steamy encounters in the previous book. Zsadist's tender care of Bella as she recovers from the abduction, and his reliving of the memories that have haunted him for years as a blood slave are so well done. This is really JR Ward at her finest!Reread March 2020: I had forgotten how much I adored this book. I really think these first books in the series are JR Ward's very best. The love triangle with Z/Phury and Bella comes off the page in a way that's so painful to read it's palpable. You feel sorry for both of them. The opening chapters with Bella's rescue and recovery were breathlessly exciting. The development of the relationships of JM, Tohr and Wellsie was so well done. Even knowing what will happen with Wellsie, I was still on the edge of my seat. All the B stories are really interesting and well balanced with the main romance.I really love the Vishous we get in these early books. He's philosophical, the future-seer, wise. In later books, we get a different side of Vishous, one I'm not really as keen on, and I'm really enjoying this reread, because this uber-intelligent mysterious version of his character was the one that totally got me hooked.But of course my favorite part is still the delicious relationship of Z and Bella. Those two sizzle on page together. I devoured this reread in little bites, reading a few chapters a day and loving every bit.A few interesting things I noted: This is the first book where Phury's red smoke habit is introduced. I had forgotten the fun Reverend/Rehvenge reveal!Trigger Warnings:rape, sexual assault, torture"

If you haven't read the first two books, there may be some small spoilers.\"I'm not broken, I'm ruined. Do you understand the difference? With broken maybe you can fix things. Ruined? All you can do is wait to bury me.\"(Just add the scar and this is my PERFECT Z)Zsadist is the broken warrior of the BDB. He had a different upbringing than the rest of the brotherhood. As an infant, he was taken from his family. When he was a child, he became a blood slave. He was abused in more than one way, and he never really got over it. The only person who can usually get to him is his brother Phury. Z is the way he is for a reason. He doesn't feel good enough. He seems like a cold blooded scary killer, but underneath his hard exterior, there is so much more. He is sad, scared, tortured, and self loathing.Then there is Bella...Bella comes from an aristocratic vampire family. She is a woman of worth. She had a connection with Z in the last book, and he felt it too. But he felt unworthy of her, so he pushed her away. Now she has been missing for months. Z makes it his personal mission to save her. She has been captured by the lesser known as 'O' and he is more than obsessed with Bella. Zadist doesn't give up no matter what, and he finds Bella against all odds. Once Zsadist rescues Bella, she won't let him leave her. He tries to get Phury to take care of her, but she wants no one but Z. My poor Z... he just can't handle the feelings Bella has for him, or the feelings he is starting to develop for her. We learn much more about Z's ugly past and why he feels the way he does. Bella wants him, needs him, but he pushes her away. No matter what she says or does, he still feels unworthy, unclean.\"I love you.\"Z squeezed his eyes shut. \"Don't be a tragedy, Bella.\"\"I'm filthy. I am so very dirty. I am dirty, dirty... Can't you see the dirt? I see it everywhere. It coats me. It seals me in. I can feel it on my skin-\"\"I don't want this for you. All this... ugliness.\"Z broke my heart. His story crushed me. He is so beautiful on the inside, I couldn't take all the self-hatred. He keeps pushing, and eventually, he pushed Bella too far. I felt so bad for that poor soul. But he tries to do better for Bella and for himself. Then when he finds outBella is with his child :Dhe knows he has to do even more. The transformation he makes is incredible. So many happy tears at the end of this one!My most favorite part\"You are the one. For her, you are the one.\"There is a lot more going on besides Bella and Z's story of course... We get a lot of Phury in this book, and we get introduced to someone named Revhenge, who I'm sure we will see more of later down the line! I loved getting to see more of John- don't know what it is about him, but I LOVE that kid! Along with Z and Bella's heartbreaking story, something even more tragic happensTohr's shellan dies :( I cried a good bit at that part...This was truly one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. I can't even put it into words how much I loved it. Probably my favorite PNR ever. If the rest of the series is even half as good as this book, then I can't wait to get to it! The epilogue was just wonderful! Can't wait to see more Zsadist and Bellaand childIn the future books!!!A MUST READ!!!"

Growing up as a blood slave, his past shaped his persona, repelling him from physical contact and affection.Bella was born into aristocracy. Despite her bloodline, with beauty and poise, she was attracted to Z's ruthless recklessness because she could see the goodness within. But breaking in was never as simple as it seemed.I love The Black Dagger Brotherhood series (even though I don't normally read the genre), but I delayed continuing the series for a long time due to the book length. Now I'm regretting doing that because I could have progressed in the series a lot more than I currently am. Even though the books are long, they certainly worth every words.\"I am sick. I am disgusting. I can't be trusted.\"When Z was first introduced in the series, I found him repulsive. But very quickly I was intrigued by his nature and I wanted to know more about him. This book certainly brought justice to this misunderstood character. He was surprisingly endearing, and paired with his past, I just can't help but falling in love with him.I admired Bella's strength and determination. Outwardly, they were like day and night. But inside they were more similar than anyone would guess.\"So you've got to understand why I die for you every day. Your pain is mine.\"My heart hurt so much for his twin Phury. Their bond, conflicts and sacrifices was heartbreaking, yet heartwarming.\"The two of you are spending way too much time together, you feel me?\"I've always loved Butch and V's bromance. And this book, they took it to the next level. I also love John Matthew. His story was a prominent secondary story chronicling his growing pains.Lover Awakened unsheathed a different side of Zsadist while actively including several secondary stories making it an exciting and engaging story. I can't wait to see how things are going to evolve from here.Books in the series:For more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit:"

Honestly I haven't read a book with this many feelings a in while. I really loved the first half of this book but the ending was disappointing. How I view a protective male is more ~go after her~ but he also needed to work on himself so I can (never) be mad at Z but still disappointing."

Or what's the point of reading romances??Zsadist is the ultimate tortured-hero-badass-turned-good romance fantasy guy. And can I please rent him when I'm \"in heat\" next time? Cuz the sex scenes when Bella has her needing?...DAMN!"

Z seemed like such a tortured hero in the previous books.\"I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came...and I was awakened.\"It would take a strong woman to save Zsadist. But then again, I think the women I have met so far are strong – ya hear me, Irene?\"Z: \"You know, this was a hell of a lot easier when you were out cold in the back of that truck.\"Phury: \"That was you?\"Z:\"You think it was Santa Claus or some shit?\"Phury and Zsadist are twins but Z was taken when he was young from his family and kept in slavery in horrific conditions\"She is more beautiful than I have words for. And last night, I was blessed beyond measure to serve her.\"He wept then, wept from the generosity of her, from the kindness, from the feel of her gentle hand as it rubbed over his shoulder … the only touch he had welcomed in … forever.Some parts of the story were so sad. You just felt so bad for him and what he had been through.\"You are in a prison with no bars. I worry about you.\"\"Sometimes your whole life could hinge on a fraction of an inch. Or the beat of a nanosecond. Or the knock on a door.\"This one seemed a bit darker than the first two\"I… What are you saying, Zsadist?\" she stammered, even though she'd heard every word.He glanced back down at the pencil in his hand and then turned to the table. Flipping the spiral notebook to a new page, he bent way over and labored on top of the paper for quite a while. Then he ripped the sheet free.His hand was shaking as he held it out. \"It's messy.\"Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOUHer lips flattened tight as her eyes stung. The handwriting got wavy and then disappeared.\"Maybe you can't read it,\" he said in a small voice. \"I can do it over.\"She shook her head. \"I can read it just fine. It's… beautiful.\"\"I don't expect anything back. I mean… I know that you don't… feel that for me anymore. But I wanted you to know. It's important that you knew.\"I am really looking forward to the next book as I love Butch in the books. Not so sure about Marissa. Will have to wait and see.

This is (so far) my favourite book and brother of the series, and if possible I'm more addicted then ever.Zsadist THE ultimate in the alpha kingdom of vampires ~ Broken, destroyed, scarred, damaged, dark, dangerous and I LOVED him.Zsadist is my favourite of the brotherhood and his story stole my thoughts, feelings and book heart. I loved delving more into the brotherhood world and the author has a brilliant talent of bringing other characters into the limelight as the story develops.In this instalment we see more action and drama and definitely more of the 'lesser' soulless beings, yes the alphabet crew O, X, U, M etc play their staring roles in the book and I actually enjoyed reading about their part to play more in this book than I did the previous two. What grabs me about this series is the real hand on heart, honest to goodness friendship between the characters. The Brotherhood has me in laughter and tears in equal measure and this book showcases it to a fine art.Once again great story telling, a little more angsty and gritty and I found myself more nervous of the outcome of Zsadists journey, lets say 'on the edge of your seat' reading experience.There wasn't much if anything at all that i didn't LOVE about this book, but my favourite scene was the First kiss. Yes all out epic first kiss, my heart melted and I was in a puddle like state.So what's this crazy fang like story all about you ask? Take a vampire, a dark, dangerous one who has seen the world in all it's darkness and cruelty, mix in some yummy brothers (the kind that are protecting its race). Bring along a beautiful she-vamp who falls into danger (she's also a top tastic character ~ sassy, gorgeous and a go getter). Throw in tonnes of action, bloody drama, knock your socks off romance, tickle you pink love and a few grab your tissues scenes and here we have it ~ a bloody great black dagger package! (please revert to authors blurb, i'm sure it will make more sense). If this hasn't convinced you, check out my favourite quotes:❤❤\"I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came...and I was awakened.\"❤❤\"She is more beautiful than I have words for. And last night, I was blessed beyond measure to serve her.\"❤❤\"Sometimes your whole life could hinge on a fraction of an inch. Or the beat of a nanosecond. Or the knock on a door.\"❤❤\"Dedicated to: You.There will never be another like you.For me...you are the one.Yeah, I don't have enough words for this....\"So don't wait any longer to dive into this series if you haven't already (I do realise I'm a tad slow on the uptake with these books). A paranormal romance with plenty of bite (see what I did there?).5 ALL OUT FAVOURITE BROTHER STARS.As always a shout out to my BROTHERHOOD BESTIE BUDDY and her joint love for these tasty vamps, loving the journey Anna ❤❤❤."

I am completely speechless, spellbound and unable to think a single coherent thought.It was just so breathtakingly amazing!! It's as if every single great thing about the first two books was made 100 times greater and then put into this single book of pure perfection. This is without a doubt my favourite book of the year so far and definitely the bets book of this series!Since I was at such a loss for words I thought maybe gifs would be better at portraying my feelings!Do you kind of understand how passionate I am about this book yet?Zsadist was kidnapped when he was a child and sold as a blood slave to a completely evil and sadistic mistress. Over a span of many years (from childhood until he was an adult) he was abused physically and mentally, raped and was left with so much hatred and vengeance in his heart. Even after returning to his brother, the baggage that he carries is endless and seems to last forever. Now, Zsadist is a cold, scarred and ruthless killer with so many sinister stories and rumours surrounding him. Hatred is his constant companion until one day when he rescues Bella from his enemies and feels an unfamiliar surge of protectiveness and desire towards her.Bella has been captivated by Zsadist from the very first moment they meet. Even with his scarred appearance and cold exterior, she can't help but desire him. But, he's made it clear over and over that he isn't the kind of person that she should form attachments to, but even his warning won't deter her. Neither can deny their feelings for each other for long. If they are truly going to be together, Bella and Zsadist must work together to look past his baggage and help him overcome his wounds.\"I'm not broken, I'm ruined. Do you understand the difference? With broken maybe you can fix things. Ruined? All you can do is wait to bury me.\"This book was absolutely gorgeous!It included all my favourite elements from the past two novels and then includedmoreemotion,strongerconnections and amorebreathtaking love story.J.R. Ward has created a phenomenally written, agonisingly painful yet beautiful love story.It was filled with so much angst, hope, steam, anger and finally forgiveness. It tugged on all my heartstrings and made me feel so strongly for all of the characters, especially Zsadist.I fell in love with Zsadist in the first book and he has been my favourite character ever since. He is probably the most tortured hero that I've ever read and definitely needed some loving, forgiveness and redemption. Throughout the book we hear little pieces of his back story and they each broke my heart a little bit more. It was so heartbreaking to read from his P.O.V dealing with feelings of unworthiness, insecurity and feeling tainted. Even with his hard exterior, his internal dialogue was always honest, raw and very vulnerable.\"As she carefully dried off his ragged flesh, she said, \"You are clean.\"\"Oh, no, I'm not. I'm really not.\" His voice started to rise, a terrible momentum growing \"I'm filthy. I am so very dirty. I am dirty, dirty...\" Now he babbled, the words running together, the volume lifting until hysteria pinged off the tiles and filled the bathroom. \"Can you see the dirt? I see it everywhere. It coats me.\"Scenes like this just broke my heart!In each of my reviews for these books, I mention how much I love the brotherhood and other three-dimensional and intriguing characters. This book once again showed so many developing relationships between the characters and also introduced new characters that I can't wait to hear more about. I particularly loved the focus of Phury as a minor character. In this book we delved deeper into his personality, his flaws and the sacrifices that he's had to make. He is quickly becoming one of my favourite characters and I can't wait to read this book.I feel like I've spoken lots about the sadness and heartbreaking moments in this book and little about the more positive and hopeful moments. There were so many rewarding scenes where Bella and Zsadist were overcoming their problems and finally trusting in each other. I have so much respect for both these characters and how they helped each other and other characters in this book. Zsadist, in particular, developed more than any character in this series and his growth brought so much hope to the book. It also seems that he has a more humorous and light used which sometimes has one through in the book. Another great moment — which definitely had me hot under the collar — was Bella's needing...I mean WOAH! By far the best moment in the book was the ending scenes with confessions of love and hope for the future. It was a truly heartbreaking and beautiful rollercoaster with the best possible ending.\"I won't leave you,\" he said. \"No matter how long, no matter how many times. I'll serve you and let you take my vein until it's over. I will not abandon you.\""

Can they find a future together before Zsadist's thirst for vengeance ruins it all?(LOL. Sorry, saw it and couldn't help myself).What i thought of Zsadist and Bella?:ILOVEDthem both with all my heart!They were veryrealisticanduniquecharacters to read about.Bella didn't annoy me and i understood Zsadist perfectly. I had aconnectionwith them.There were a few complications to their relationship - like Zsadist pushing Bella away. And even though he changed, i though he could do it without her if someone would show him a bit of love and support.My heart was clenching in paineverytime i read about how mean, and unfair everyone was to Zsadist.I wanted to lock them in a disgusting hole and let them rot there. They were blaming him for all the bad stuff without getting all the facts and evidence. They just automatically thought it was him.The endingwas the reason this book didn't go to my 'favorites' shelf( i was very tempted to do so at the start, but then i was like no way).It felt too rushed and cheesy to be realistic and satisfactionary enough, but i still found it a sweet HEA.Overall...Lover Awakenedwas full ofaction,heartbreak,suspense,angstandhot scenes. It was a book aboutmoving on,love,forgivenessandtrusting again. The writing style and characters were as usualFANTASTIC.Great plot too, really enjoyable.I would recommend this to all BDB fanswho haven't read this yet, and for those who have to re-read it.And for those who haven't read this series at alli would recommend you pick it upimmediately, especially if you're a fan ofLarrisa Ioneand herDemonicaseries!"

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!If I could, I would give this one 1,oooFUCKINGstars!\"'I was dead until you found me, though I breathed. I was sightless, though I could see. And then you came... and I was awakened.'\"I. Am. Utterly. Speechless.Well, in agoodway of course.\"And diamond were eternal, weren't they? They lasted forever. Just like his memories of her.\"Okay, let me talk about the ending first, since that is what I remember most XDI really found itromanticwhen Zsadist was trying to learn to read and write. That just completely warmed my heart up and melted it. Literally. I felt as though I was suffocating and couldn't breathe after this particular scene. And the fact that he addressed Mary to teach him was super sweet of him. Beth and Mary are truly amazing women but Bella is awesome-er, if that isevena word...???\"'I got you Bella,' Zsadist's voice. Low. Full of strength. 'You're safe. You're out of here. And you're never going back.'\"Next, Bella carrying Zsadist's young.Now this, was just complete shock! Agoodshock of course! Remember when Zsadist trying to learn to read and write melted my heart, well this completely burned my heart. I have literally nothing left in my chest.Nothing.I think I cried. Yep. That's right. I shed some tears. Please don't make fun of me. This was very overwhelming and made the story so good. Really, this is theBESTbook so far!\"As she shuffled back, he glanced down at the tent between his legs. Christ, that goddamn thing in there was huge; he looked like he had another arm in his pants.\"Now, let's talk about Phurry. Let me get this out there, I wasfuckingstupid. That one scene when he shaved his hair off and cut his face, Ihonestlythought that he was trying to be Zsadist to get Bella for himself. I. Am. So. Fucking. Stupid. And then, like the idiot I was, it took me a while to realize that Phurry is sacrificing himself so Zsadist doesn't die. I don't knowwhyI didn't get that before. Something is wrong with myBRAINBut that's beside the fact. What I'm trying to say is that Phurry is the best brother ortwinsomeone could ever ask for. Zsadist isreallyreally lucky to have a brother like Phurry. He's the type of person whom you could trust with yourwholeand Imeanwholelife. I'm not talking shit right now. I'mserious.Dead serious. Phurry doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would break promises or isn't capable to putting someone down just because they harmed someone he loves.\"I'm filthy. I am so very dirty. I am dirty, dirty...\"Zsadist: When Zsadist was first introduced inDark Lover, I fell in a hole. A deep hole. The deeper the hole, the deeper I adore Z. At first, it was pretty deep, inLover Eternal, it went a little deeper, and now, inLover Awakened, I'm telling you, it can fucking reach Hell. I don't know why, but from the moment when I first read about him, he just was like a magnet that attracted to me. I wish I were Bella instead of me, but we all know that ain't even gonna happen. Anyways, even though he was very quiet at first and wasn't really open, he can surprise you and be the complete opposite. In this book, he talks a lot and showcases a lot of his emotions, which I really loved, so thank you very much,J.R. Ward. You. Are. Amazing. Really, I could go on and on and on and on and on, etc., about how Zsadist is such a great and sexy-ass character, but I'll stop there :)\"For her, he was... the one.\"Bella: I feel the same exact way for Bella. Even though she was introduced inLover Eternaland was a minor character, I felt as though I really connected with her, as I did with Zsadist. Again, I could write a 10 paragraph essay on how good Zsadist and Bella are but eh. 10 paragraphs seems too long for me to write at the moment.\"Dear Virgin in the Fade, no wonder males killed to protect their mates.\"Oh, and I forgot to mention, Isobbed.I literally burst into tears. Why?Wellsie...Sarelle... (not really sure how to spell her name)So everything in this book was utter perfection except for this one part. J.R. Ward just had to come out of no-fucking-where and throw this bombshell at us! What. The. Fuck? And David. Or should I say, \"Mr. O/O.\" Ok. I don't like to have too much cuss words in one review because I don't want to come out as someone who needs to cuss to live. I really don't. But just this once, I'm going to say it: O is a fucking piece of fucking shit. He is a fucking asshole. Ok. There. I said it. Like Bella and Zsadist, I could give you a whole essay on how much I hate O but I ain't gonna bother because pieces of shit like him deserve fucking nothing. Nothing. I feel really bad for Thorment and John Matthew.... I'm wearing black tomorrow to mourn for Wellsie. No fucking joke. I will. But hey? It's not like someone is gonna come up to me in the middle of the street and ask me why I'm wearing black. Only you and I will know *evil laughter* It may seem as though I'm taking this a little to far, but I mean it. I was HEARTBROKEN when O, like the motherf**ker he is killed them both. And to think that Sarelle and John could've been a thing :/ I HATE LESSERS AND THEY SHOULD ALL DIE AND GO TO HELL!Oh, and Rhevenge, Bella's older brother being the Reverend that owns ZeroSum: this rendered me speechless. I honestly didn't see that coming. Really, when I was reading this, I was so stupid. I was too caught up in how sexy Zsadist was XDAll in all, this book wasFUCKINGamazing! Can't wait to get started on Butch and Marissa's story,Lover Revealed.\"Man, he was going to need a neck brace after this conversation.\"\"'I could tongue you forever.'\"\"Bella took the paper. In a child's uneven block letters there were three words: I LOVE YOU.\"\"'I carry your young.\"'If you think I'm taking even the slightest chance with you and my young, you are out of your mind.'\""

        "user_review": "5 Stars!!!OMG this book was theBESTbook in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series yet!!There was so much drama and angst and it hurt so much to put the book down and continue with life when I had to :(So...into the details!This book was about the brother Zsadist! It told the story of Zsadist and why he is so feared and standoffish compared to the other brothers. The book explained Zsadist's past by including flashbacks of when he was essentially kidnapped by this rich cougar \"mistress\" who feeds off of a young male until he can't take her odd and perverted ways and they commit suicide. So unfortunately Zsadist was a blood slave for this terrible woman and she REALLY fucked him up...so much that he \"lost his soul\" and his eyes turned a lifeless black.Also, the book gives us some details about Phury and his relationship with Zsadist. Phury's love for his brother is soooo inspiring but heart wrenching! Phury will do anything for Zsadist, even sacrifice his own life for him. Like COME ON THAT MOVIE THEATER SCENE???So...like the previous books, there was a shellan! Bella who was Mary's friend from the second book in the series, is absolutely captivated by Zsadist and falls in love with him almost instantly. She knows he is dangerous and arrogant and pretty much an asshole but she thinks he has more to him than what he leads on. Their journey was such a slow burn romance and it kept me captivated the whole time! But to be honest...the ending of the book was such a surprise!!! That reunion...sooo cute omg.This book left me with a couple questions that I will probably find the answers to in later books but right now I'm just soooo confused on a few things...Okay first, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO BUTCH WHEN HE DRANK V'S BLOOD?WHY THE FUCK WAS V LOSING HIS VISIONS??REHVENGE IS THE REVEREND??? WHY??And lastly... during one moment in the book I was like FUCK YEA and that was when Butch denied Marissa after she shut him down so many times. Like you go Butch...don't let her play you like that!Overall, this was an amazing read!! I will definitely be continuing this series and I believe the 4th book is about Butch and Marissa...which shall be interesting!"

        "user_review": "\"We can't behave like people in novels, though, can we?\"A few years ago, I readThe Age of Innocenceand thought it was okay. It has something of an Austen-esque feel - criticisms of middle/upper middle class society, paired with a subtle and clever humour and a love story (here deliciously scandalous). But it's taken me a few years to come back to this novel and appreciate the magic Wharton has brought to the table.This little book is so clever. Everything about it from the damn title to nearly every piece of dialogue is perfectly-placed and often ironic. Things that didn't hit me fully the first time around became so much more important in this reread. Wharton knows 1870s New York City like the back of her hand; she knows its habits, its traditions, and its expectations of people. She creates a rich, twinkly picture of parties and social standards that is both delightful and ultimately ridiculous - then she throws a spanner in the works.Never has a love triangle been so welcomed by me.This isn't the modern affair we're used to, where a girl must choose between hot guy #1 and hot guy #2. Nope, in this story, Newland Archer is torn between the stability, comfort and duty he can be offered by the socially-favoured match with May Welland... and his passionate, all-consuming love for the unconventional, rebellious and ostracized Ellen Olenska.\"Each time you happen to me all over again.\"It's as important as it is beautifully written. Wharton casts an eye over this society, both disdainful and affectionate. Incorporating issues of female emancipation into the story, never has the idea of a woman enslaved by marriage and convention seemed so unattractive from a male perspective. Newland Archer is full of modernity and the call of new ideas, but finds that any freedom he poses to May she would receive only with the intention of pleasing him. Though, it should be said, I believe May is far more than she seems.It's hard to read the ending of this book without feeling emotional, but the exact emotion may differ with your interpretation. Ambiguity reigns supreme as this novel finds its close and even the coldest of unromantics will surely have their hearts pulled along for this...ride. One of my favourite tragic love affairs.\"Only, I wonder – the thing one's so certain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?\"Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr"

        "user_review": "Part of why I loveThe Age of Innocenceso much is for the very reason my students hate it--the subtlety of action in a society constrained by its own ridiculous rules and mores. In Old New York, conformity is key and the upper-crust go about a life of ritual that has no substance or meaning. Both men and women are victims in this world as both are denied economic, intellectual, and creative outlets. All the world's a stage in Wharton's New York and everyone wears a mask of society's creation. Such is the norm until Newland Archer.Symbolically, Newland represents an America on the cusp of modernization, the awkward period of transition between the Victorian era and World War I. At first a devout member of New York aristocracy, Newland is awakened as one from a trance with the arrival of Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen decides to separate from her abusive husband, Count Olenski, and is rumored to have escaped the Count by having an affair with his secretary--a scandalous circumstance that brings her back home to her native New York. Vibrant, intellectual, and free-spirited when compared with the dowdy and restrained women he's known, Ellen's predicament is a revelation to Newland. As he himself has just ended an affair with a married woman and knows the ease with which society forgave his indiscretion when contrasted with Ellen, Newland begins to acknowledge the inequality amongst the sexes. However, there's a serious roadblock to Newland ever being with the captivating Ellen: Ellen is the cousin of May Welland, Newland's fiancee.Wharton writes with cutting wit about the hypocritical and ludicrous customs of blue blood society and cunningly plots events to work against Newland, the archer whose target is a \"new land\" in which he and Ellen can be together. The pity is that, ultimately, May proves to be the more cunning huntress who cleverly stalks and traps her quarry in the labyrinth of society.Cross posted atThis Insignificant Cinder"

        "user_review": "The blurb on GR gives a good summary so I will start with that as the first paragraph:Winner of the 1921 Pulitzer Prize, The Age of Innocence is Edith Wharton's masterful portrait of desire and betrayal during the sumptuous Golden Age of Old New York, a time when society people \"dreaded scandal more than disease.\" This is Newland Archer's world as he prepares to marry the beautiful but conventional May Welland. But when the mysterious Countess Ellen Olenska returns to New York after a disastrous marriage, Archer falls deeply in love with her. Torn between duty and passion, Archer struggles to make a decision that will either courageously define his life—or mercilessly destroy it.Elite New York society says of the Countess, separated from her husband who remains in Europe, \"And now it's too late; her life is finished.\" For a time she considers going back to her husband. She shocks people by wearing the wrong things, hanging out with the wrong people or by engaging men in frank conversation. In elite New York society at that time a woman could not walk away from conversation with a man to engage in conversation with another man; she had to wait for him to come to her.The Countess shocks people by referring occasionally to 'my husband' when everyone expects her never to mention him. But she is somewhat protected by her family connections: she is Newland's wife's cousin. Even though people will say in conversation \"I don't want to hear about anything unpleasant in her history\" all of them already know all the dirt.Those in New York society at the time thought themselves superior to their counterparts in Europe. They think know European customs because they all honeymoon and vacation there for months at a time. Their goal is to keep out the \"new people.\" They spend fortunes on dresses from Paris but wait a year to wear them because it is not sheik to wear the 'latest fashions.' A woman is dishonored by her husband's shady financial dealings. While they claim to be well-read and to love art and music, they will not hang out with those types of people or invite them to their parties. In conversation people are so uptight blush and pale constantly.Newland thinks of his wife May as a 'Stepford wife.' Seeing her brow glistening in the light \"…he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years to come , would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a weakness, a cruelty or an emotion.\" May is \"That terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything…\"Newland thinks of himself as enlightened. Among men he says \"Women should be free – as free as we are,\" knowing full well that \"Nice women, however wronged, would never claim the kind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were therefore – in the heat of the argument – the more chivalrously ready to concede it to them.\" But of May he thinks: \"There was no use trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free…\"After Newland and the Countess fall in love they enter into a kind of limbo: \"Her choice would be stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer; and it depended on himself to keep her just there, safe but secluded.\" I'm reminded of another novel I read recently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez. Can you really pine away with love for someone your entire life?There is good writing. Just a couple of examples:Said of an ancient matron: \"She always, indeed, struck Newland Archer as having been rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a perfectly irreproachable existence, as bodies caught in glaciers keep for years a rosy life-in-death.\"The opera lets out: \"Americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it.\"There's a lot of local color of New York's Fifth Avenue district and of the mansions of Newport, Rhode Island.A great read and I will add it to my favorites! Thanks to Tina, Tom, Jaidee, Joshie, Dan and Heather who encouraged me to read more of Edith Wharton, this book in particular.(Edited 11/11/2021)Top photo of a New York Fifth Avenue mansion from boweryboyshistory.comInterior of a modern Fifth Avenue mansion fromthenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/A mansion in Newport RI (Chateau Sur Mer) from assets.simpleviewinc.comThe author from edithwharton.org"

        "user_review": "\"With a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.\"5 'not so innocent' stars for the 'Age of Innocence'. A novel about love, duty, and freedom set, in New York, at a time when the existing social structures were giving way to penetrating modernism and changing values within and around familial structures and the society itself. A book that then cleverly personifies these cultural and social changes through the three central characters caught in a love triangle which plays out with such intensity, you can feel the moral dilemma, the battle between honour and passion and ultimately, the loss of innocence.A book that is extravagant in its personal reflection but delicate in its expression and one that is beautifully crafted but written with such elegant prose. A story that is stripped back from exaggeration, convoluted themes, and complex characters, as we as spectators keenly observe how lust dominates and love can cloud the mind. And the sacrifice? - well innocence of course.The StoryNewland Archer is heir to the fortune of one of New York's wealthiest families who is promised to May Welland, from a noble family with an equally prominent status in New York society. However, Archer's head is turned when May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, returns from Europe creating a scandal for leaving her husband and ending their marriage by refusing to return.Initially encouraged to keep company with the lonely, exotic, and beautiful Ellen, Archer finds his interest and affections challenge his own views on his engagement to May. On the one hand he asks May to marry him sooner to prevent him straying and on the other hand, he continues to pursue and flirt dangerously with the women who is set to challenge his values and reputation as he finds himself conflicted between duty and honour and with love and opportunity.Review and CommentsChanging society and Culture- The late 19th Century and early 20th Century is one of the most interesting historical periods, with its rigid and uncompromising social structures, the view of marriage and the survival of prominent families and their fortunes assured through well matched suitors, and the role of women, which created the perfect backdrop to tell this story.\"The untrained human nature was not frank and innocent; it was full of twists and defenses of an instinctive guile. And he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious purity so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers, aunts and grandmothers\"New York itself a microcosm of Victorian England, changes through the story, and with it, the social machines, values, and beliefs as the era of genteel snobbery gives way to a ground swell of new ideas, new money, the spirit of enterprise, and a generation prepared to challenge the long-standing divisions and ideologies in society. Something the author seemed to have difficulty with as she looks back on this period in her own life as the loss of innocence through this social revolt, which is reflected in some of her comments, such as\"The difference is that these young people take it for granted that they're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took it for granted that we shouldn't.Was it a feminist story?I don't think so. Instead it was a story where the author took advantage as a writer of overlaying her own principles and frustrations at the repression of women when she says things like '..women ought to be free\". However, also an author who valued the purist and principled attributes of a society she loathed to see changing.The characterisationis outstanding, as most of these timeless classics are. May Welland symbolises innocence, and it is the changes in society, social structure and values that are played out so vividly in the character of May. Ellen symbolises the opposite, a worldly woman who is the antipathy of innocence meanwhile Archer cuts the most tragic of figures at times. A man whose life was predestined and the city he loved, and its culture was to become his most unforgiving adversary. His personal reflection on his reasons for marrying May, sums up all that was flawed in a society where people felt trapped and duty bound to follow custom\"He had married because he had met a perfectly charming girl.. and she represented peace, stability, comradeship and the steadying sense of an unescapable duty\"The clash between values, social and familial expectations, the vigorous spirit of modernism, the rising voice of women and the role of marriage and the ability to choose, provide a perfect historical backdrop for this gorgeous novel. A profound and powerful story of self-denial, love, honour, freedom, and commitment, but ultimately a loss of innocence!!! A book written with timeless elegance and purpose. An epic, a story for all generations.\"After all there is good in the old ways….. but there was good in the new order too\"_________________________________2nd Read with a Book Club - 30th June 23I have enjoyed rereading this as part of reading club / group in the last few weeks and I must say this was one of the best group reading experiences I've ever had. So would highly recommend for reading clubs. There are so many threads that brought the group alive and despite offering some topics at the beginning of the discussion the group found a lot more. I thought this approach really worked to start the discussion but did not hinder the debate on anything. Fabulous.Two points were heavily debated by the group but one all were in agreement on was the significance of the historical period, class structures, and attitudes of the time by both men and women. Opinion was however divided on the following1.\tThe individual versus the 'group' where the group was viewed as conformists and the 'individuals' dared break free of the shackles from the past. Although it was the sacrifice that was to be made with such pursuits that focused our eye on the main characters. Some of whom enjoyed the indulgence of the higher social and wealth classes, so when that all important question is posed 'What would you do for love?' – they failed in my eyes!!!2.\tMay Welland strangely enough divided the group which for me was the most interesting discussion point. Some viewed her as highly manipulative. For me she represented the loss of innocence more so than anyone else and of course I don't see that as contrived but rather a sad indictment of the times. Manipulative or a survivor – you decide, but a hardening of her heart for sure and the ultimate loss of innocence.\"Ah, good conversation — there's nothing like it, is there? The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.\"What a lovely quote to find in honour of this great reading experience.I confess to missing the significance and symbolism of the 'torn wedding dress' at the end of the book the first time I read it. Ironic and mocking as well as poignant and bitter, but affecting nontheless.Perceptible, evocative, delicate, flagrant, immoral but still heartbreaking."

        "user_review": "(L''Amour Vainqueur - William Adolphe Bouguereau)Suddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying: \"But I 'm only fifty-seven –\" and then he turned away. For such summer dreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of friendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness.When deadening conformity to the discipline and traditions of a small society has almost become one's second nature, even dreams can hardly breathe, suffocated in the airless vacuum of an oppressive and hypocrite environment in which the double standards on marriage, divorce and sexuality and the stifling expectations towards men and women strangle both sexes alike, no less caging the men than the women in a straightjacket of duty and propriety. Who would have expected such in the Land of the Free, making Wharton sneer that 'It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country'?What a stunning masterpiece.Honestly? Because all I can do for the moment is waxing poetic over Edith Wharton's gorgeous and meticulous prose and stand awestruck and speechless at Wharton's craft and perceptiveness, every word I could possibly jot down would feel shamefully trite and inadequate. So I will just humbly bow down and read this fabulous novel once more, perhaps next winter.I was quite surprised to discover what a powerful imprint watching Martin Scorsese's film back in 1994 must have made on me, sensing the verbal Newland Archer, Ellen Olenska and May Welland seamlessly converging with memories of the actors who played them, supplanting almost any other visualisation of them taking shape in my mind.Forgive me for the ironic appliance of this sweet and innocent-looking painting professing that love conquers all. To refer to Vergil's motto thatLove conquers all, and so let us surrender ourselves to Lovewould be needlessly cruel and sarcastic in the context of this novel, but a little irony seems to fit it like a glove (I don't think Edith Wharton would mind).Frailty, is Thy Name Newland Archer? I don't think so. You chose loyalty, a virtue implying sacrifice and betrayal of others and of yourself, a wry self-submission to inauthenticity. This reader imagines you torn like the man in Willem Elsschot's 'The Marriage', looking back on your life moodily though melancholic rather than embittered or cynic.When he noticed how the fog of timeput out the embers in his wife's eyes,eroded her cheeks, cleaved her forehead,then he looked away and was consumed by regret.He cursed and ranted and pulled at his own beardand met her with that gaze, but could no longer love,he saw the greatest sin in the duty of the deviland how she looked up at him like a dying horse.But she did not die, even though his hellish mouth suckedthe marrow from her bones, that kept on carrying her.She did not dare to speak, to ask or to complain,and shivered where she stood, but lived and stayed healthy.He thought: I will beat her to death and burn down the house.I have to wash this mould from my rigid feetand run through the fire and through the puddlesuntill I reach another love in someother country.But he did not kill her, because inbetween dream and actthere are hindering laws and practical issues,and even melancholy, that no one can explainand that comes at night, when we all go to sleep.The years went by. The children grew upand saw how the man, they called their father,seated motionlessly and silently at the fire place,gave them a godforsaken and grizly gaze.('The marriage' by Willem Elsschot (1910))"

        "user_review": "'The longing was with him day and night, an incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten. He could not see beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her voice. He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it, the rest of the world might seem less empty.'There was never getting away from their circumstances for Newland and Ellen, the protagonists ofThe Age of Innocence. As I weep for them and their unrequited love, I realized it was not meant to be.Edith Whartondepicts masterfully New York's traditions and judgmental airs, which were from the start against them. This elite group within which they existed had very rigid rules of behavior, social rituals, fashion, and clear censures for those that violated them. There is a clear hypocrisy in their life that existed behind their conservative moral exterior.\"In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.\"As I started reading Edith Wharton's crisp prose and witty dialogues, I got to know Newland Archer, May Welland and Ellen, Countess Olenska. What was inescapable from the outset is that they were a product of New York society of their time.As Newland meets Countess Olenska, he is not prepared for her worldly persona. Thus it is that May and Newland make their engagement public right away, to ease the acceptance of Ellen into their social pack. May is considered the perfect model of what a young wife should be: young, beautiful, soft, obedient, pliant, conventional, and with no opinions on anything of importance. We would consider her boring, but those were different times.Newland starts out pretty much the same; he's a young lawyer, used to his luxurious and idle style of living; all in accord with the strict rules of society. Yes, both are good persons with many amiable qualities, but they simply are not exceptional. They were clearly not in love, just following rituals that defined that a young man should marry a nice girl with a good family.'There was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at the question from what point you choose. Of course such a marriage was only what Newland was entitled to…'Newland and Ellen's love story is nevertheless magnificent because it is the changes and character growth of both lovers that make it endearing and wonderful. When we first meet Newland Archer he could not have been more in tune with New York society's status quo:But Newland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and May's, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable. What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a \"decent\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?If Newland Archer seems indecisive and hesitant, it's in part because he is conflicted with his values and desires. He even starts defending new ideas,\"Women ought to be free – as free as we are\"Nevertheless, it is easy to note how typical Newland Archer was when we first meet him, how judgmental, how hypocritical:There was nothing mean or ungenerous in the young man's heart, and he was glad that his future wife should be restrained by false prudery from being kind (in private) to her unhappy cousin; but to receive Countess Olenska in the family circle was a different thing from producing her in public, at the Opera of all places, and in the very box with the young girl whose engagement to him, Newland Archer, was to be announced in a few weeks. No, he felt as old Sillerton Jackson felt; he did not think the Mingotts would have tried it on!Could he have been more traditional?'He hated to think of May Welland's being exposed to the influence of a young woman so careless of the dictates of Taste.'Yes, in the beginning, he hated the idea of his innocent fiancé being contaminated by the worldly Countess.Nevertheless, Newland's careful and predictable world is flipped completely upside down when he meets and really gets to know the intriguing and intrepid Countess Olenska. As the plot moves on, we discovered all is not as we first envisioned. Newland is changing as he falls deeper in love with Ellen. He soon starts to show signs of rebelling against his previous ideals, begins transforming himself. A conversation with Ellen's grandmother and family matriarch is particularly revealing:\"Poor Ellen—she was always a wayward child. I wonder what her fate will be?\"\"What we've all contrived to make it,\" he felt like answering. \"If you'd all of you rather she should be Beaufort's mistress than some decent fellow's wife you've certainly gone the right way about it.\"But his transformation is not fast or deep enough, he is not able to entirely free himself from the constraints imposed on him by society and his own upbringing. He is not courageous enough?, you might ask.'His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.'But there is much more at play here. He soon realizes how restrictive his marriage was, how loveless and lonely his life would be:'There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that May's only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration.'And much more,'He perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in the future many problems would be thus negatively solved for him; nut as he paid the hansom and followed his wife …he took refuge in the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the most difficult in marriage. \"After that I suppose we shall have pretty nearly finished rubbing off each other's angles,\" he reflected; but the worst of it was that May's pressure was already bearing on the very angles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.'Even after understanding what his marriage would make of his life, he cannot escape.\"Outside it, in the scene of his actual life, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency, blundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room. Absent—that was what he was: so absent from everything most densely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him to find they still imagined he was there.\"He cannot break up from convention, although he dreams of going as far as Japan with Ellen:\"Archer had fancied that his path was clear before him. He had meant to have a word alone with Madame Olenska, and failing that, to learn from her grandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to Washington. In that train he intended to join her, and travel with her to Washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go. His own fancy inclined to Japan.\"Even if the story is told through Newland's point of view, we cannot forget how much Ellen suffered. Probably even more than him, since it seems she had no choice:\"Oh, I know—I know! But on condition that they don't hear anything unpleasant. Aunt Welland put it in those very words when I tried.... Does no one want to know the truth here, Mr. Archer? The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!\" She lifted her hands to her face, and he saw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob.We also soon discover that May is not so innocent. Although all her fight seems to be enforced to defend her marriage, its survival, and in that she would never change. What she learned with her mother she would repeat in her marriage'Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland'.No, she was never weak just limited.\"I told her I was afraid I hadn't been fair to her—hadn't always understood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many people who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to criticise, and yet didn't always know the circumstances.\" She paused. \"I knew you'd been the one friend she could always count on; and I wanted her to know that you and I were the same—in all our feelings.\"But Newland was still dreaming of breaking away from everything, of being with Ellen. He tells May he needs to get away, but she was ahead of him. Not an innocent at all:\"I want to take a break–\"\"A break? To give up law?\"\"To go away, at any rate – at once. On a long trip, ever so far off – away from everything–\"He paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with the indifference of a man who longs for a change and is yet too weary to welcome it. Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated. \"Away from everything – \"he repeated.\"Ever so far? Where, for instance?\" she asked.\"Oh, I don't know. India – or Japan.\"\"As far as that? But I'm afraid you can't, dear … Not unless you take me with you. …That is, if the doctors let me go …but I'm afraid they won't. For you see, Newland, I've been sure since this morning of something I've been longing and hoping for–\"\"Have you told anyone else?\"\"Only Mama and your mother. …That is – and Ellen. You know I told you we'd had a long talk one afternoon – and how dear she was to me.\"\"Ah–\" said Archer, his heart stopping.What I concluded is that Newland might be rebellious while May is until the end tradition itself. This pattern we witness endlessly, and when Newland ponders what their marriage and family life had been like it is all summed so clearly:'This hard bright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered. Her incapacity to recognize change made her children conceal their views from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first, a joint pretense of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated.'For one thing, his life as a man allowed him more freedom even to circumvent social customs for he was not as closely watched. Not that it was easier for him, for he struggles between social conformity and honesty to one's emotions. And not that May would want to change. She was set on her role without any uncertainty.And often we see him contradict himself. Despite his transformation, we realize he will always be a 19th century man, as we witness him saying things such as\"What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a \"decent\" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?\", while later he will dream of running away with Ellen.The essence of Edith Wharton's novel is whether Newland and Ellen ever had a chance? Not at their time. And Ellen recognizes reality:\"Ah, my poor Newland – I suppose this had to be… You're engaged to May Welland; and I'm married\". And Newland replied, \"It's too late to do anything else\".To apart mean a return to their old respective life patterns, but to be together would mean going against what they both loved the most in the other.I can't love you unless I give you up.Being together would mean breaking too many rules, hurting loved ones, and carrying a guilt that would ultimately separate them if not physically for certain emotionally.\"But you knew; you understood; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands—and yet you hated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. That was what I'd never known before—and it's better than anything I've known.\"This great work is a bittersweet love story at the mercy of society's morals and ethics, with conflicting values that prevents them from realizing their most ardent desire to be together. I'd say this is the strong and beautiful point of this classic.The idea that he could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying Countess Olenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.Even more heartfelt:The long was with him day and night, an incessant undeniable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten.The characters are forced to adjust and readjust to their changing life, but that is still not enough. At least it was not in their lifetime. The changes they go through are not deep enough to allow them a happy ever after. How painful to live through this changing times; and how dreadful to accept their fate. I can just imagine and suffer for them, and weep for them. Here lies the greatness ofThe Age of Innocence.Their fate was to be apart, and so nothing rests for them but to keep their memories intact. It's what we lost and our memories that stay with us. If he had gone up to meet her, it would be another story.'\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.'Oh, I have to repeat myself: there is nothing more heartbreaking than unrequited love. So I weep again for them.---My first impressions:\"I can't love you unless I give you up.\"Oh, Vessey, I just finishedThe Age of Innocence! And I have to tell you that the last 10% conquered me. It made it me think that it had to be. They were set on their way before Ellen arrived and Newland and Amy made public their engagement. And I believe it had to end as it did. Suddenly, I discovered it deserved 5 full stars. It's what we lost and our memories that stay with us. If he had gone up to meet her, it would be another story.I loved how it analyzed his marriage with May, the old costumes that are no more. That hypocritical society that held him down is finally fading. But too late for Ellen and Newland.Well, it is all still too new to me, and the only thing I can say is that it touched me deeply. Maybe more because of my age, since I know enough of life and remember all that I lost and could never simply be revisited.\"It's more real to me here than if I went up,\" he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.There is nothing more heartbreaking than unrequited love. So I weep for them.____"

        "user_review": "(Book 726 from 1001 books) - The Age of Innocence, Edith WhartonThe Age of Innocence is a 1920 novel by the American author Edith Wharton. It won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, making Wharton the first woman to win the prize.The story is set in the 1870's, in upper-class, \"Gilded-Age\" New York City. Newland Archer, gentleman lawyer and heir to one of New York City's best families, is happily anticipating a highly desirable marriage to the sheltered and beautiful May Welland.Yet he finds reason to doubt his choice of bride after the appearance of Countess Ellen Olenska, May's exotic and beautiful 30-year-old cousin. Ellen has returned to New York from Europe after scandalously separating herself (per rumor) from a bad marriage to a Polish count.At first, Ellen's arrival and its potential taint on the reputation of his bride-to-be's family disturb Newland, but he becomes intrigued by the worldly Ellen, who flouts New York society's fastidious rules.As Newland's admiration for the countess grows, so does his doubt about marrying May, a perfect product of Old New York society; his match with May no longer seems the ideal fate he had imagined. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «عصر بیگناهی»؛ «عصر معصومیت»؛ نویسنده: ادیت وارتون ؛ انتشاراتیها (جار؛ فاخته؛ سخن، نشر نخستین، نقد افکار)؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز هفدهم ماه نوامبر سال1995میلادیعنوان: عصر بیگناهی؛ نویسنده: ادیت وارتون؛ مترجم: مینو مشیری؛ تهران، فاخته، سال1373؛ در389ص؛ چاپ چهارم سال1378؛ شابک9644304591؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: عصر بیگناهی؛ نویسنده: ادیت وارتون؛ مترجم: پرتو اشراق؛ تهران، جار، سال1373؛ در319ص؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، نشر نخستین، سال1378؛ در4ص و319ص؛ شابک9646716296؛ باعنوان عصر معصومیت؛ تهران، نقد افکار، سال1389؛ در400ص؛ شابک9789642280803؛اگر داستان را نخوانده اید شاید این نوشتار داستان را لو میدهد هشدار میدهمادیت وارتون، نخستین زنی بودند که جایزه ی «پولیتزر» را دریافت کردند، چکیده داستان: «نیولند ارچر»، در اپرا «کنتس الن النسکا» دختر عمه نامزدش «می» را دیدار می‌کند؛ «الن» به دلیل جدایی از کنت ثروتمند، و فرارش به همراه منشی کنت، و تمایلش به مقابله با عرف جامعه، خودش را بر سر زبانها انداخته است؛ در همین حال، «نیولند» به «می»، که دختری زیبا، ولی فاقد قوه تخیل و ساده است، پیشنهاد می‌دهد، که هرچه زودتر با وی ازدواج کند؛ دختر تقاضایش را رد می‌کند، و با اصرار در مورد روابط دیگر وی، پرسش می‌کند؛ «الن» برای مشاوره گرفتن در مورد طلاق احتمالی خود، به دفتر حقوقی «آرچر» مراجعه می‌کند؛ «آرچر» با خانواده «الن» موافق است، که رسوایی ناشی از این امر، خطر بسیار بزرگی است، و خود «الن» نیز با این موضوع موافق است؛ «الن» فرار می‌کند، و از «آرچر» می‌خواهد که به دنبال او بیاید، «ارچر» فکر می‌کند که شوهر «الن» در تعقیب اوست، اما در واقع کسی که آنها را تعقیب می‌کند «بئوفرت» است، بانکداری که به سختی با نیویورکی‌ها کنار می‌آید، و به داشتن معشوقه زیاد مشهور است؛ «ارچر» که در شور و هیجانات «الن» گرفتار شده، تصمیم می‌گیرد نامزدی خود را به هم بزند؛ اما پیغامی از «می» می‌رسد، مبنی بر این که والدین خود را متقاعد کرده، که تاریخ ازدواجشان را جلو بیاندازند؛ پس از ازدواج، «ارچر» و «می» به مسافرت سه ماهه‌ ای می‌روند، و در این میان با افراد زیادی، منجمله «ریویر» که یک معلم سرخانه «فرانسوی» است؛ دیدار می‌کنند؛ پس از آن آنها تابستان را در «نیو پورت» می‌گذرانند، و «می» در آنجا جایزه ی مسابقه تیراندازی با کمان را می‌برد؛ «ارچر» که هنوز هم مفتون «الن» است، هر بار بهانه‌ ای می‌آورد، تا بتواند او را ببیند، حتی پس از اینکه «الن» شهر را ترک می‌کند؛ «ارچر» میفهمد که «ریویر» - همان منشی، که «الن» همراه او از پیش شوهرش فرار کرده است - پیغامی برای «الن» آورده است، که در آن کنت خواستار بازگشت «الن» شده است؛ اما «ریویر»، به «ارچر» اصرار می‌کند که «الن» را از بازگشت به «لهستان» باز دارد؛ پس از حمله قلبی «کاترین مین��وت»، «الن» موافقت می‌کند، که برای زندگی با وی به پیش او بیاید؛ «ارچر» همچنان امیدوار است؛ سپس «می» به «ارچر» می‌گوید که «الن» تصمیم گرفته، به اروپا بازگردد، اما نه پیش شوهرش؛ پس از میهمانی خداحافظی «الن»، «می» رازی را فاش می‌کند، که او چندین روز قبل، به «الن» گفته بود، و اکنون نیز او فقط به شوهرش اطلاع می‌دهد: او حامله است؛ اکنون در پایان وقایع، با «ارچر» از طرف خانواده‌ اش بعنوان فردی ولخرج، که به سمت خانواده‌ اش بازگشته رفتار می‌شود؛ دهه‌ ها می‌گذرد و «ارچر» که اکنون همسرش درگذشته است، و در زمینه سیاست‌های آزادیخواهانه، فردی فعال و محترم است، بخاطر وعده‌ ای که به پسر خود «دالاس» داده است، به «پاریس» سفر می‌کند؛ پس از آنکه «دالاس» به پدر خود می‌گوید، که او از همه چیز درباره «الن النسکا» اطلاع یافته است، آنها تصمیم می‌گیرند، که از آپارتمان «الن» دیدن کنند؛ اما «ارچر» تصمیم می‌گیرد، که دورادور روی نیمکت پارک بنشیند، و «دالاس» را، برای ادای احترام بفرستد؛ «ارچر» به نوری که از آپارتمان «الن» بیرون زده نگاه می‌کند، و سپس تنها و به آرامی و قدم زنان به سمت هتل می‌رودتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 06/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "Myself and the Pulitzer prize have previously not always seen eye to eye, but Finally, I have read one worthy of giving top marks to. This golden oldie captures the wholesome atmosphere of American life and the highest standard of American manners and manhood from a bygone era, where modern ideas are resisted and tradition overcomes compassion. The inhabitants of this hothouse of New York society is built on wealth, life is lavished, easy and comfortably cushioned, but this world may just as well have been covered in a blanket of cobwebs, as the lives are so sedate and uneventfully dull, despite their opulent surroundings, they appear colourless and motionless. It is ultimately a tragic tale that Wharton weaves, and yes, as with a lot of classic fiction based around love, it's told with air of melancholy because this love is one that doesn't really get off the ground. For Newland Archer, the leading male character, there is an imagining of an alternative existence to the one that convention has pressed upon him, he has built within himself a kind of sanctuary for his secret thoughts and longings. Within these walls are his bride to be, May Welland and Countess Olenska, who would change his whole world.\"The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend\"Archer is a perfect product of Old New York, a member of one of the most prominent, historic families, he lives in the obligatory sumptuous brownstone on Fifth Avenue with his mild mannered mother and spinster sister, and languidly pursues the law as most gentlemen of his age and inherited wealth do. He is engaged to the young, beautiful, and equally impeccably bred May Welland, who is sweet sweet natured but naive. After twelve years away returns the Countess Ellen Olenska, May's cousin, who through no fault of her own upsets the balance of Newland's life. She is beautiful, vivacious and intelligent, whose long period of living in more liberal European surroundings has made her innocent of the nonsensical, unspoken rules of the society she has reentered, and incapable of maintaining the shallow facade of her female relatives. Newland feels a life of quiet misery lies ahead, and despairs over Olenska as they grow closer and closer, because he is forced, by his own realisation, to know how Ellen will be treated if she dares to divorce her husband, and advises against it, even though he is devoured by love for her.Wharton mesmerizes with the sheer depth of emotion, pain, and frustration bearing down on Newland's shoulders, he really is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Through thwarted dreams, despairing disillusionment, unbearable regrets and the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience, Newland and Ellen share a secret love that enables each of them to be the best people they can be, fulfilled intellectually, emotionally and socially, and the fact they can never be together in harmony is just as unbearable for the reader as it is for the characters, and this is where Wharton excels with people you truly believe in. For May, she is neither clever nor truthful, and only rarely shows a spirit that reveals a depth of feeling in the face of connvention and social expectations. In telling the story of how Archer and Olenska, against all the strictures and taboos of their society, fall in love, Wharton seems to be siding with the individual in this universal tug-of-war. But I don't think it's ever that simple. Certainly, New York's upper society in the 1870s was one of grandeur, but it is described in Archer's thoughts and Wharton's observations as a prison of the mind, one where the cells are sprinkled with gold dust.The finale, of many years later, moved me immensely, I thought of all that went before, a story that in terms of characterisation was searing on every page with the intensity of this doomed love affair. A stunning novel, impeccably told. And I think it's unfair to simply label this as old fashioned 'chick-lit' because it's about so much more than what appears on the surface. Her tone is sardonic and to some extent cynical of the social world into which the reader enters, and she portrays this society, its conventions and traditions, through the unforgettable vivid characters whose behaviour and thinking were moulded in time."

        "user_review": "Appearances can be deceiving as this superb classic novel reveals...Newland Archer has the perfect life rich young and good looking, a member in excellent standing of New York's High Society of 1871 during the Golden Age. These people feel not like prisoners, but brave members of a group keeping back the barbarians at the gate. Newland is engaged to a beautiful charming girl May Welland also in the exclusive association, who loves him. But then her mysterious cousin arrives from Europe, Countess Ellen Olenska married to a brute a Polish nobleman who repeatedly degrades her, showing contempt for their marriage by parading lowly women in front of the Countess. Not trying to hide his transgressions, letting the world know it. The fleeing woman is a childhood playmate of Mr. Archer, and he can still remember her as she, he. First seeing the fugitive again at the Opera, with his future bride and family in their box. May loves her cousin and Ellen, loves May... The Countess causes quite a stir with the audience, men look approvingly at the attractive lady, women more critical. Poor Ellen as the relatives call her, living with an unconventional grandmother Mrs. Manson Mingott so obese she needs help to get up, nevertheless the lady is the head of the family and people listen to, even though she has strange ways then again very rich but... stingy. There is an unstated powerful attraction between Archer and Ellen, still duty prevents anything unsavory from happening besides Newland, believes in the proper way of doing things. A self described dilettante who goes through the motions of being a lawyer, in an office where he has little to do. Archer lives with his widowed mother Mrs. Adeline Archer, she is forever saying that everything is changing for the worse in the city and spinster sister Janey, they look so alike the two could be sisters, both depend on each other for companionship. He's a secret fanatic a bookworm receiving the latest editions from London, staying in a room reading that's when the gentleman is happy. Mr. Archer has no close friends the only person he can feel comfortable with, be himself is Ned Winsett a penniless struggling journalist, but of the lower class with a sick wife. Newland wants his wedding to happen earlier than is the established custom, hoping temptations will end if he is married to May. Even traveling to St.Augustine, Florida, on a surprise visit, where May is vacationing with her family for that purpose, his boss is not elated. Mr. Archer is wrong , clearly the gentleman loves the Countess and she returns the sentiment. Boorish banker Julius Beaufort vastly wealthy, an uncouth foreigner ( married to an influential and quite proper lady a NewYork society woman) with a propensity to break all the rules, is chasing the skittish Ellen she needs to get away. They meet clandestinely in Boston the Countess and Archer; away from the prying eyes of everyone, the two hope just to hold each other... At a family gathering in Newport, Rhode Island, Newland is told to fetch Ellen, he goes down to the beach sees her on the pier, passionately stares for a long time and retreats back to the house, it would not be proper he thinks. An elegy saturates the whole book, from the first page to the last."

        "user_review": "\"Each time you happen to me all over again.\"Imagine that person you love most in this world, right within your grasp, but somehow out of reach. An invisible thin wall keeping you apart. Apart but not away from each other. Together yet not with each other. This is the worst form of torture, a torture of invisible chains and soundless screams. Constantly seeing each other, constantly being reminded of what cannot be. Constantly falling in love yet constantly falling apart. The urge, the love, the longing constantly growing, engulfing you until you cannot bear to live. Every part of your body numb and unaware of the realities around you. Because for you, only the pain you feel is real. The only truth you know is that everything is a lie.Edith Wharton paints a very delicate picture that resonates elegiac waves and enraptures its readers to the very bone. One can't help but succumb to this level of desire, of emotion and empathize because of the atmosphere that Wharton has created. Her prose is crisp, straight and true. One might say that her prose is a reflection of her New York socialite self. (Wharton was born with quite a few gazillion silver spoons stuck somewhere on her buttocks.) Aside from that, with such a dazzling foray of words, she evoked such emotion in me that I was afraid I might like her Facebook page at some point. So with that in mind, I vowed to refrain from using Facebook until I've finished reading this book. Well, it worked fine for me. On another note, I was really impressed with her depiction of the 1870s New York. Based on a little research I did, her canvas of the place was just spot on splendid.\"It was the spirit of it -- the spirit of the exquisite romantic pain. The idea that the mere touching of a woman's hand would suffice. The idea that seeing her across the room would keep him alive for another year.\"That sort of a relationship, that unique communication between two people savagely drawn to the other like moth to a flame is of a different level than all the other types of communication. This communication between them is that of the deepest kind. A communication that needs not one of the five senses. This communication of feeling, of intense knowing, of mutual understanding, this unity of the mind, this shared consciousness is the effect of a love that knows no bounds, strengthened to an insane proportion by the fact that it was never meant to be.\"The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!\"\"What's the use? You gave me my glimpse of a real life, and at the same moment you asked me to go on with a sham one.\"But what really struck me the most was that irony that these two people enlightened to be different from the \"pretend people\", who revile them and mockingly laugh at their trained innocence and hapless practices were to be subjected to a pretend relationship as well. \"In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.\" They that were above that \"Innocence\" were cruelly placed upon a circumstance in which they have to feign Innocence as well, as the only way to sustain their love for each other. \"I can't love you unless I give you up.\" This has led me to believe that such innocence can only be a result of circumstances beyond their powers. That altogether this Innocence is merely through the progression of unstoppable forces not necessarily known to the person it affects. Such is also the case with the New York Society. These people did not choose to succumb to this veiled innocence, it was mercilessly hurled at them. They were raised in these circumstances, in a society where conformity is the norm and to question this conformity would be self-abdication. Thus, these people will die by this code.This Age of Innocence reflects a view in which Newland Archer is also an innocent victim. He thinks his wife too much of an \"innocent being\" that he is surprised in the end and utterly moved when he finds out that she is not so innocent at all. And the lifting of this veil seemed a wake–up call to him at the very end, when he was about to meet the Countess Olenska with his son, that he realizes that he has lost this innocence. She had become the symbol of everything that could have been, all his hopes and dreams. She was the unreachable star. In the end, he was afraid that all that sustained his love was that invisible shackle, that sense of longing, that feigned innocence. And that the innocence was all that kept him to Ellen, and without it, he cannot bear to face her.\"And you'll sit beside me, and we'll look, not at visions, but at realities.\"\"I don't know what you mean by realities. The only reality to me is this.\"The dream has become a reality and the reality a dream.\"'It's more real to me here than if I went up,' he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other.\""

        "user_review": "Yes indeedy, what could be more jejune than another early 20th century novelist choosing as her subject the problematic relations between the sexes amongst the idle rich? D H Lawrence and Henry James do the same, the first like a big dog gnawing at a bone and finding something it mistakes for God in the marrow, and the latter in his infinite cheeseparings putting the whole thing into the form of a three-dimensional chess game played by sardonic French subatomic particle physicists who you suspect ownlittle dogs, the kind you want to step on andsquish. And many other novelists great and small dance about on the same subject.Well, Edith Wharton starts off like she is trying to get at something very interesting in The Age of Innocence. Here is the young man contemplating his future marriage:What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a 'decent' fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal? ... He reviewed his friends' marriages - the supposedly happy ones - and saw none that answered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland. He perceived that such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the versatility, the freedom of judgement, which she had been carefully trained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were : a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.Much later the young man sadly muses thus:There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free- apart from making you think\"how very rude!\"this begs the question what liberty, exactly, did this proto-feminist man suppose could be accessed by upperclass females in the 1870s in New York? Edith Wharton's clear intelligence makes me think that ambiguity clouds these various musings only because she fears she's already been too bold. So this compelling theme gets lost when she subtly changes gear. Still, there are enough zingers to keep you reading and relishing - for instance -What if 'niceness' [in a wife:] carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness?Hmm, what if indeed. Or, concerning the rigours of class in New York,It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country- nice one, Edith.There's no getting away from it, Edith is indeed Henry James in drag, and this novel is kissing cousins to the early HJs like Washington Square, The Bostonians and The Portrait of a Lady. These idle rich, they're dull buggers you know - indeed Edith goes on and on about just how boring their lives are as she describes the dining, the travelling, the frittering, the spending, the ladylike sports the ladylike ladies did (archery - no, not nude mud wrestling, what large sums would I not pay to read Edith Wharton describing such a scene), the families, the clans, their history, their posh houses, their posh horses - oh please spare us - half way through you really wish that the fabric of space and time should rend asunder and a scary bunch of Sendero Luminoso guerillas break into the great ballrooms and dining rooms and haul the whole pack of them off to the sweaty jungles of Colombia for some serious political indoctrination. Plot spoiler : this does not happen. Instead, this book is a study of circumscription and circumspection, of people (the hero, the heroine and the wife) not getting what they want. And as such, when we are able to skirt round the pages of orotund description (A winding drive led up between the iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of geraniums to a front door of highly varnished walnut under a striped verandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow star-patterned parquet floor upon which opened four small square rooms with heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an Italian house-painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus\" - did you get all that Mr Set Designer?) the heart of this tale is sad and almost beautifully done. But really mimsy with it.**PS - I saw the movie too which was as elegant as all get-out, apart from the dodgy Enya-like song splodged in the middle. That Michelle Pfeiffer - cor, blimey. I wouldn't kick her out of bed. Still and all, the movie is a 100-minute argument as to why you should read the book instead, because what's missing is Edith Wharton's mind, which is a great place to dally in. You get voice-overs in the movie which only serve to remind you how literary adaptations, however spiffily dressed-up (and aren't they all?) are not the real deal, they're the unreal deal. These movies are like aides memoires on gorgeous notepaper written with a ten thousand dollar pen. The note says : read the book."

        "user_review": "This book, which examines lives stifled by the social conventions of 1870s Manhattan, is a classic masterpiece precisely because it is anything but conventional. Ironically, it had me longing for the lovers to dip their toes in love-story convention (by finding a hotel room, at least once), especially with lines like this one:\"Each time you happen to me all over again.\"Oh, Newland Archer! Oh, Ellen Olenska!But no, the brilliant Edith Wharton doesn't allow it. She stays the course, showing the follies of Old New York society, the sometimes impossible and suffocating nature of marriage, and the changeability of social mores that seem so important in the moment but which are forgotten with the passing of a few years. She also shows how both noble and tragic it is to \"do the right thing\" rather than chasing happiness where it flies.The poignancy of resignation and missed opportunities reminds me of similar themes addressed inThe Remains of the Day. And though Wharton's Pulitzer Prize winning novel was written almost a hundred years ago, it still feels fresh and relevant.This was my second reading of this book. The last time I read it was probably two decades ago, so it was almost like I was reading it for the first time. The only thing I can remember of my first reading was the feeling I had as I turned the last page. The overwhelming sense ofI loved this, and must read it again. I had the same experience this time. I guess some things just don't change."

        "user_review": "The Age of Innocenceis basically a love triangle. Newland Archer is a wealthy lawyer of upper-class New York society, who is engaged to be married to May, a member of the same society. Ruled by well-laid conventions, Newland believes him to be happy and content and eagerly awaits his impending marriage. The meet of Ellen, May's cousin, and his closer association with her that follows make him see the dull and empty life that he is forced to live which is tightly controlled by convention. Newland eventually falls in love with Ellen, but convention and duty require that he should surrender his love and freedom.I didn't take to the character of Newland Archer initially. His cowardice and inaction really bothered me. Even when May offers him that he may break the engagement if there is \"another woman\" whom he desires to marry, he does not grab at the opportunity. Although he constantly lamented over his lost opportunity to love and live freely, it is his own inaction that brought him misery; and not only to him but to May and Ellen. But later, on reflecting on his character, I realized that I cannot judge his character by modern convictions. Given the time period in which the character is set, nothing was surprising in Newland's cause of action. The conventions by which they lived were a second religion to them from which it was almost impossible to deviate.May was the representation of family, duty, and convention. She is described as pretty, socially perfect but one who lacks imagination and room for growth. But I felt that she was severely misunderstood, especially by Newland. While she puts a socially acceptable face outwards, underneath lives a strong, intelligent, and artful woman who goes to greater lengths to secure what is hers.My sympathy was with Ellen who was an innocent victim of fate and convention. Her character represented the universal \"unconventional women\". She was always portrayed in soft, kind, and truthful light with a mind of her own, and I believe, she is Ms. Wharton's heroine.Through the main characters of Newland, May, and Ellen, and supported by several interesting supporting characters, the story is a true portrayal of the lives and way of living of New York upper-class society. Being herself part of that society, Ms. Wharton draws a truthful account of it, satirically portraying at the same time, their rigid conventional ways of living. The story concludes with the final chapter being set thirty years later, which shows how the people have slowly managed to unchain themselves from these strict bonds. This chapter was a breath of fresh air.The writing is beautifully detailed, and the psychological portrayal of the characters is cleverly done that it was easy to connect with the story and its characters from the very beginning. Her writing is easy-going yet graceful making it both a quick and interesting read.This is my second reading of Wharton's work and I loved it. To me,The Age of Innocenceis a story of an \"age of innocence\" where people were kept within strict social rules where imaginative and passionate living is neither heard of nor sanctioned."

        "user_review": "New York society at the end of the 19th century. An impossible love story.I've been so amazed by this novel that I don't even know how to begin my comment on it. The book starts slowly, mentioning the (actually not so) many names and families composing New York society of the time: their intertwining and relationships are difficult to follow.Then, around page 40-60, the story unfolds: it is a love story between two members of New York society. One (Archer), a conformist who cannot escape etiquette and is about to get married and the other (Countess Olenska), who fights every day against it, and left her Polish husband running away from Europe in the hope that she will be backed up by her family in New York.But what I enjoyed most in this love story was Wharton's great ability to tell it without falling into pathetic tones and exaggerations (like, for instance, the Brontë sisters) and, above all, starting from the very subtle and, at times, ironic description of the characters' thoughts (in particular, Newland Archer's).Only through this expedient can we truly understand the New York society of the time, pity its non-conformist members, laugh at their bigotry and tribal organization.And then comes the ending, one of the most beautiful endings ever: Archer's society, with all its rules and conventions has almost vanished in the following thirty years.What is left is his regret that he didn't act when and how he would have liked. Not having made the right decision at the right time, against all those changing social norms.Beautifully delivered, although the second part was better than the first. But am I to deny the novel 5 stars just for this dense and a bit confusing beginning.P.S. : Also, see the excellentmovieby Scorsese (1993)!"

BIG mistake, if this is romantic take me to the nunnery….Okay, the ugliness of the story is offset by the beauty of the writing, and it is gorgeous, I'd read this author again - but still. This isn't so much a review as an attempt to purge this pile of hooey from my subconscious.1st off the main protagonist Newland Archer isa celebration of hypocrisy. A man who makes a CLEAR choicehe knew he loved another woman but married anywayto reap the benefits of marrying well\"After all, marriage is marriage, and money's money—both useful things in their way ...\"then wastes his life and the lives of the women who share it by spending it lamenting his decision.\"His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.\"Throw in the proverbial'vapid'ball and chain of a wife\"There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free.\"Add to the mix unrequited looove, the lust for another woman. Goes without saying that in stark contrast to the wife she's intelligent and utterly fascinating.\"poetry and art are the breath of life to her.\"Pen the above in gorgeous prose, set in high society New York, shake & stir and voila! Pulitzer prize for fiction.Cons:So predictable, and except for Newland's the characters are shallow, undefined and stereotypical. How it took the Pulitzer is beyond me.Meanderings:Huge sigh of relief when I FINALLY finished this. Needed a break from 'escapist' fiction so followed it withEels: An Exploration, from New Zealand to the Sargasso, of the World's Most Mysterious FishLoved it (review to follow). Eels are slimy, ugly and refreshingly uncomplicated! So obviously I'm a bit weird. Just to be clear my dislike for this novel isn't because I over-empathized with the wife. I've never married and I don't think I'm vapid:) No, I'm probably just pissed that I've been fooling myself for years, believing my like or dislike of a novels characters didn't impact my appreciation for a book. Wrong...Newland Archer made me eat my words."

        "user_review": "The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing.Just when I think a classic unlikely to give me pause, it surprises me with relatable themes. After reading Wharton's short story, \"The Muse's Tragedy\" (one of the supplemental reads I'll be teaching this Fall), I knew I had to visit one of her longer forms. So rewarding it was, to be wooed by elegant prose and positioning; a plot that moves in practiced laps; a story that could be yours, mine, theirs; a setting that will always be known for both its vibrance and austerity.Wharton is a writer of words nestled in conscious rhythm, the director of a play that centers around societal distinctions like class and gender, yet still embodies universal themes of love, betrayal, and self-actualization. Wharton writing from a male's perspective reminds me of Cather, inMy Ántonia: they do it so well, so authentically. She had Henry James as a mentor, and yet I prefer her books to his (although I see a resemblance to my favorite James book to-date:The American).His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.Countess Olenska is not just a woman ostracized in 1920s New York Society: she is symbolic of New York on the verge of change, the cusp of a new era; she is love and beauty and complications; she is pain, consolation, a new life which uncovers an insipid way of living. The Countess represents fresh ideas, a new way of thinking, a society that doesn't place class and materialism before all else, a bohemian way of being. The Countess is hope.I realize I\"m taking an unorthodox stand, seeing as how the Countess also represents infidelity and betrayal, and the uproot of normalcy. Yet knowing Newland's choices when he meets Ellen, one knows that in the end, he'll make a decision forced upon him by his society. In the end, we see his gratitude for life, and the regrets from his choices, which once again, reminds us of the complications of life. Wharton leaves us with an ending rife with speculative contemplations, and as readers, we become just like her characters.Something he knew he had missed: the flower of life. But he thought of it now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined would have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first prize in a lottery.Conventional New York was not ready for the Countess. The city had not yet formed itself into the diverse structure it now is, with a roadway tunnel that traverses the Hudson river, and a train station that connects you with New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In fact, conventional New York City was also unprepared for The Harlem Renaissance, taking place only a few blocks away, in the same decade and the same world, yet separate and forgotten--like Ellen Olenska.But then you come; and you're so much more than I remembered, and what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit perfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my mind, just quietly trusting it to come true."

        "user_review": "The first thing that I must admit is that I liked this book much more than I expected to like it. I think I judged this book by its many sort of boring covers and the fact that it sounded like a dry classic in some descriptions I read. I know, \"BAD MATTHEW!\" As a voracious reader I should not make assumptions and I should go in with an open mind. But, at least with my pre-conceived notions being disproved, I was pleasantly surprised.While this book has many characters, the story is not complex. This is good because I could focus on keeping the characters straight instead of the story straight! It is basically a story of how late 1800s high society in New York handles behavior they feel unbecoming of their station. It is especially \"shocking\" when one of their own becomes involved and forgets his place. Scandalous indeed!I enjoyed the characters and felt strongly – both positively a negatively – about many of them. I did a lot of head shaking. I did a lot of feeling sorry. I did a lot of not being able to believe how people viewed and treated each other. What we see as rather commonplace today in relationships was not to be tolerated back then. I suppose that is reflected in the title of the book – it was an age of innocence – even the smallest sins were too taboo for daily life and not to be accepted or discussed in public forum. I am interested to discuss this further with the book club I read this for and in comment discussion on this review. I am still trying to figure out what the commentary the author was trying to make. I almost feel like the author's point could be interpreted as \"This is how it was – no subtext implied – you decide how you feel about these people and the way they treated each other.\"I have no problem recommending this if you are looking for a classic to read. If you are a fan of historical fiction and/or scandalous gossip stories I don't think you can go wrong here. After this, I look forward to trying even more Edith Wharton."

        "user_review": "Oh, Edith Wharton. I wonder if she ever thought that her stories would still ring so true almost a hundred years later… Not just because of the classic love-triangle situation, but also the concern with appearances and reputations and the grand show that people put on for others to watch and judge.The character development in this book is simply amazing. One is tempted to judge and pigeonhole these people, but the more you read, the more they reveal themselves to be much more complicated and interesting than they appeared at first. I do confess to a small book-crush on Newland (not because of Daniel Day-Lewis' interpretation, though that is totally worth checking out), who is tragically stuck between two ways of thinking: the old-school one that he was brought up in, and the more modern one, which is right around the corner but not quite acceptable yet for someone of his station. He doesn't want to ruffle any feathers, but he is noticing with increasing annoyance that some of the customs held up by his social circles simply don't make sense anymore. His struggle is so vividly depicted that you end up just as torn as he is and by the end of the book, you just want the guy to be happy.The sharp, witty writing that jabs so cleverly at the shallowness of the lives of the New York upper crust is another very strong point of this novel. Edith Wharton shows us the gorgeous, highly polished surface of society and scratches at it mercilessly, but she somehow avoids being condescending. Her long descriptions of furniture and priceless china is not there to mock so much as it is there to show us what these people cared about, and how ultimately silly it. I admire her restraint and the complete absence of meanness in her prose.Ellen Olenska is one of the most wonderfully drawn characters I have encountered in a long time. Her strength of character, her need for independence, her yearning for happiness: all these things stunted by the conventions of the society she returned to, looking for comfort and support. Her story is really tragic: the bad marriage, the straight-laced relatives who can't understand why she wants a divorce, the man she knows she cannot have because she refuses to hurt her cousin or to be someone's mistress. Ellen wants to be first fiddle and she will not settle for less, even if that means giving up the man she loves. I admired her, but I also felt incredible sorrow for her.This is one of my favorite books, and I warmly recommend it to everyone. If you have already read it, give it another go: I find out new delightful details and meanings every time I pick it up."

        "user_review": "Some romances efficiently drive others from the mind! Because if we had to classify this book by Edith Wharton, it would be difficult not to stick the label romance to it.In the time of innocence, she shows how bourgeois New York society only functions on pre-established codes for which no one can really remember the reasons (see specific passages on dress rules) but which nevertheless govern the whole. Relationships between individuals, including at the most personal level. The happiness of individuals never seems to be the end goal and is even a variable to consider. The New World seeks to distance itself from the Old while copying it.But the romance aspect is not entirely obscured, however. On the contrary, it is in the foreground with a nuanced analysis of the feelings, thoughts, and renunciations that cross the two main characters, caught in this societal straitjacket and dreaming of breaking free from it. And where we touch, the masterpiece is all conveyed by small innuendo touches that leave the reader in suspense. Thus, you will understand what made the Time of Innocence a significant work, which justifies 2019 as a new translation closer to the original.Wharton was almost 60 years old when the book was published, a time when all innocence was arguably gone from his life. However, we feel through her words that, just like her characters, she would have liked to be able to find her, the time of a kiss."

The novel was written in 1920 and the novellas that pick up, somewhat on the side, some of the same charactersMrs Manson Mingott, Sillerton Jackson, Mrs Struthers, Henry Van der Luydenwere published four years later. Although \"Old New York\", with its windows onto the four decades of the 1840s; 1850s; 1860s and 1870s, provides the introductory framework of the city of Wharton's (obsessive?) memories and of her earlier novel. The Age of Innocence is set in the 1870s, although the reader keeps the feeling that one is watching it through a telescope that zooms onto the past. This suspicion is confirmed in the last chapter, when the novel is wrapped up at the turn of the century.Whatever the order, my reading attitude has been the same in both works. Firmly rooted on their sense of place and time, I kept marking in the map of my mind where he various characters stood, where they walked (mostly up and down 5th), and lived (brown-stoned houses and later in the somewhat surreptitious cream-colored buildings), for their particular siting forms certainly part of their portraiture.In reality this is my second reading. From my first experience I just remember that I had started reading just after sitting on a lecture on the act of looking in nineteenth century painting. The most striking scenes were opera watchers not watching the opera but watching at each other watching themselves. I was then struck by the rounded structure of the novel for it is at the opera that the plot begins; and ends. The reader can see him/herself as witnessing the story from one of the boxes beginning, lets say, at the left side of the horseshoe shaped theater, and gradually moving to one at the extreme right ending it from one of theThe novel is also loaded with references that ground the work to its times and its culture. It is loaded with references: Painting (Bouguereau, Cabanel, Carolus Duran); Art history (Ruskin, William Morris and Walter Pater); Literature (Swinburne's Chastelard, Merimée's Lettres à une inconnue, Paul Bourget); Music (pianist Sarrasate, tenor Campanini); Theatre (George Rignold)... It is all there.This novel is foremost a sociological analysis and although it is, at its core, a sharp and censorious critique of the collective and ethical mores of a very particular society, it retains an air of nostalgia that for a twenty-first century reader brings a certain wistfulness when one realizes that many of the criticized social barriers have been pulled down but that the revealed boundless field can also seem somewhat disorienting. The reader cannot but ponder what would Wharton have thought of today's freedoms."

The plot centers on a love triangle between the unself-aware protagonist, Archer; his passive wife-to-be May; and her cousin Ellen, a free-spirited countess newly returned to America from Europe, estranged from her husband, and unlike most of her status-conscious family. Through the relatively conventional story, the novel smartly explores social tensions and gendered conflict among the wealthy, and considers America's relationship to Europe."

        "user_review": "Before writing this review I decided to find out a bit more about Edith Wharton. Turns out that she is actually a lot more interesting than some of her books. If you turn to the Wikipedia page (not exactly hardcore research, I know but I'm not in a position to march off to the library and start wading through Wharton's presumably numerous biographies) you'll be faced with a picture of a timid and pretty dour looking lady with two disagreeable looking Paris-Hilton porta-dogs plonked on her knee.Don't let appearances fool you ladies and gentlemen, for Wharton was a regular social and creative dynamo; designer, socialite, writer, Knight (Chevalier of the legion of honour for her work in France during the war) there was no stopping this woman.So back to The Age of Innocence. What's it all about? Mostly about how being young, rich and desirable and mixing with the cream of society isn't all it is cracked up to be. Why? Well because high society is actually incredibly dull. Really? Yup. In order to set themselves apart from the grubby minions who do the dishes, drive the coaches and actually work for a living, \"society\" set about creating a set of hideously constrictive rules and moral guidelines which sap the joy, happiness, fun, freedom of expression and general day to day life out of everyone involved.It is incredibly ironic that everyone then strives to get accepted into this set when everyone who's already there is so damned miserable most of the time. Most of Wharton's principal characters are unhappy with their lot and lead a treading-on-eggshells existence because they're terrified out of their wits about any kind of scandal. Obviously scandal of sorts does ensue but everyone deals with it very nicely, calmly and diplomatically without any mud slinging or calling in Piers Morgan.Clearly a lot has changed... now massive scandal can be a potentially lucrative money earner if you have the right press connections and in certain cities (Lets pretend I don't live in one of them) people set out to bed a sleb (celebrity) and then launch a modelling/music/TV career based on the back of some good quality kiss and tell anecdotes.The best thing about this book for me was the names of the main characters. Not satisfied with a range of traditional names (you will find no James, Johns, Matthews or Mikes here reader) Wharton presented me with a barrage of people with names like Newland Archer, Manson Mingott, Sillerton Jackson, Emerson Sillerton and Dallas Archer. Eek! Perhaps the silliness of the names mirrors Whartons' own slightly mocking perspective on the society she herself inhabited.If I had been brought up in high society I would have probably had to kick off my satin slippers and throw myself under the wheels of the first passing horse and carriage as soon as I entered adulthood. Who would want to live in such constrained times? Not I."

        "user_review": "Although written in the 20th century,The Age of Innocencecould well be seen as a pastiche of 19th century literature. We have the naïve, well-meaning young man who tries yet fails to overcome the prejudices of his society and social class; we have the foreign woman, sophisticated and beautiful, with whom the young man duly falls in love; and we have the fiancée, the typical girl-next-door so beloved in America pop culture, getting between our heroes. Intermeshed with this love triangle, are very rigid puritanical mores, which spill into intricate forms of class divide. I am familiar with how classism works in Europe, remnants, in part, of the old aristocratic order. But although I had heard something about Old Money vs New Money in the US, I had never seen it in action.The psychological insights only a post-Freud world could provide make this novel truly extraordinary. The love story between Archer and Countess Olenska is beautifully written not for what it is but for the insights into Archer's feelings, wonderfully illustrated by the quote:Each time you happen to me all over again. And in fact, the encounters between Archer and Olenska are sparse. Archer spends much more time thinking about her than with her. What could then be a rather banal love story turns into a sublime relationship made of self-denial and lofty feelings. On the other hand, it is precisely the relationship between Archer and his wife, May, that is very much banal, dirty and sullied despite May's pretences at purity."

Ah, Newland Archer, my love, my heart! As a woman in 2016, it was refreshing to read about a man in love. It feels like modern media usually portrays women as the desperate, clingy, unreasonable and unrealistically passionate ones. The truth is, we're all susceptible to the foolishness and intensity that comes with being in love.In the beginning of the novel, Archer is accepting and eager about his role and future in society - son, lawyer, bachelor, husband, father. It's the familiar and reliable path followed by the best of his male family, friends and colleagues. There's a comfort in knowing that your major life decisions are predestined, planned and orchestrated by others. Archer learns, however, what he must give up for that comfort. Complacent in his engagement with May Welland, he meets her vivacious and worldly cousin Countess Ellen Olenska and discovers how passionate and surprising his life could be. This awakening causes an internal crisis for Archer. By sticking to the status quo and doing what is expected of him, he gives up many of his liberties. But if he forsakes society, he brings dishonor to his reputation and isolates himself and anyone associated with him. It is this struggle that is the driving force in the novel.The Age of Innocenceis a brilliant portrait of upperclass New York City in the 1870s. I went in with very high expectations for this novel - this is the second book by Edith Wharton that I've read, Ethan Frome being the first - and she did not disappoint. An intimate and critical exposé of society coupled with Edith Wharton's elegant prose secures this novel as one of the greatest pieces of American literature I've read yet.For more bookish photos, reviews and updates follow me on instagram@concerningnovels."

(like, prometheus is obviously famous, but you don't throw his example around like my boy sisyphus. sad.)ANYWAY. welcome back toProject Long Classics, the series in whichelleand i read a long classic over the course of the month, too make it less scary!some updates here: 1) we're rereading, 2) this isn't long, and 3) it's not coming from a place of fear. but otherwise, we're all set.we're also reading this for our book club -join the discussionherefollow on instagramherelet's go!!!DAY 1: CHAPTER ONEwe're immediately late (today is july 2), and yet that's fine, because i love this book and also i only have to read one chapter a day this time around. living the dream.something i love about anne elliot is that she should be quite boring - a realfanny price, if you will - and yet she isn't.and relatedly, i get why people are upset by what appears to be her fleabag-ification in the upcoming adaptation...but i am capable of separating the adaptation from the book (on rare and special occasions, like arbor day and half-birthdays) and i think it seems fun.DAY 2: CHAPTER TWOlook at us, catching up!i love how in old times you could just call people \"unsuitable.\" i wish we still had that. \"i find that acquaintance to be one well below your standing, and altogether unsuitable\" (or something like that) sounds so much better than \"you are my friend, and i like hanging out with you, but i find your friend very annoying.\"DAY 3: CHAPTER THREEWENTWORTH MENTION!!!!!!genuinely...the yearning already...you gotta give it up for jane.DAY 4: CHAPTER FOURa day behind because i was drinking to make it through our nation's birthday. bleh. escapist reading time!DAY 5: CHAPTER FIVEi just...left this blank yesterday.read the chapter. added this to my update feed. didn't say a thing.the first few chapters of this are (i think) even more uneventful than usual austen books. maybe because it's less funny? i don't know. it's a lot of past to establish, where we're usually picking up right in the swing of things relatively speaking.DAY 6: CHAPTER SIXi don't like, also, the pity-party we have to throw anne every other paragraph at the beginning. yes she is lonely and her sisters are annoying. let's get to the romance part!! or give her a hobby at least.but here is some drama! another slay for miscommunication, a trope that endures through the centuries.wait why did jane go this hard:\"The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\"like jane he's dead! take mercy you have already killed him!DAY 7: CHAPTER SEVENwentworth!!! i'll kill you!!! poor anne. suddenly the pity party is working on me.DAY 8: CHAPTER EIGHT\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"slay mrs croft.poor anne again!DAY 9: CHAPTER NINEwell, folks. persuasion (2022) has debuted on rotten tomatoes with a score of 27%.i can no longer pretend it's extremely likely that i'll watch it, but! onward.all the best crushes come from one (1) completely inane moment.DAY 10: CHAPTER TENcatching up! (took another day off to be drunk. this is a tradition, at this point.)there are so many Charleses in this. it seems to be a personal affront.DAY 11: CHAPTER ELEVENlmao the whole gang is taking a road trip to visit wentworth's friend, who ol' captain thinks loved his dead wife more than any man has ever loved a woman, and anne NO JOKE thinks\"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.\"pull it together, girlfriend.DAY 12: CHAPTER TWELVEaction chapter!!! i love immersing myself in a 19th century understanding of medicine. when you jump up and down too many times, you almost die, and them's the breaks.one of anne's most relatable characteristics is being like \"hopefully i'm too old to blush now\" and then blushing constantly.DAY 13: CHAPTER THIRTEEN\"Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt, that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.\"this rules. i cannot be a lady russell hater for this alone.DAY 14: CHAPTER FOURTEENat the i-look-forward-to-my-daily-chapter-every-day phase of this :)goddamn. anne can PULL.DAY 15: CHAPTER FIFTEEN\"The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women. He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion. He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being a tolerable face among them. It had been a frosty morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of. But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! they were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\"this is the funniest and most relatable passage in the whole thing. as someone who has a rule that i should not be forced to view anyone ugly when watching television (a guideline continually broken by basketball coaches and the existence of most conservative politicians), i have to stan sir walter.DAY 16: CHAPTER SIXTEENanne's life really seems like such a snooze, from one girl who is always right to another. but at least i have indoor plumbing. and refrigerated cookie dough.DAY 17: CHAPTER SEVENTEENthe thing about jane austen books that we can forget when it's adaptation time is that the love interest is often not the most handsome of the gang. wickham is probably handsomer than darcy. mr elliott is certainly more handsome than wentworth.but still. how can we be expected, as a society, to root against henry golding??anyway. a kinda boring Anne Is Perfect chapter.DAY 18: CHAPTER EIGHTEENcome on, jane...give me some yearning today!asked and answered.DAY 19: CHAPTER NINETEENevery day has to be a yearning day at this point.WOO!!! things are picking up!i will say i feel like anne's family lacks nuance compared to, say, the bennets or the woodhouses, who are flawed characters but have their arcs and their positive traits. elizabeth and mary and sir nobility what's his name feel a little black and white by comparison.and speaking of things i will say...\"the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath\"is a great description. should have been used somewhere besides curtains.DAY 20: CHAPTER TWENTY\"A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman. He ought not; he does not.\"AHHHH!!!!!!oh boy. yearning city. this whole section is everything. and the letter soon!!!DAY 21: CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEahhhh!!! jane sure knows how to cancel a guy.DAY 22: CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOthe amount of drama in this chapter...my sister is watching below deck in the background as i write this and their screechy voices pale in comparison!!!DAY 23: CHAPTER TWENTY-THREEthe penultimate day!!! i'm going to miss this so much. should i do this all the time???...no. the last thing i need is the excuse for yet another project.THE LETTER!!!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOD.not only is this the most romantic love letter of all time (and it's not close! i openly read this out loud to someone i was with on the STREET!!! not as a declaration but just because it's really good and everyone should know about it), but the FRAMING. the conversation anne has with harville! her confusion at wentworth's dismissal! the yearning! her reaction to his coming back! and her feelings after! AHHHH.jane, no one does it like you. it'd be five stars for this alone.DAY 24: CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURthe end of an era. i have so enjoyed our time together.this is a cute kind of epilogue-y chapter, like at the end of movies that were Based On A True Story when they tell you what happened to all the goofballs you've gotten to know. i love it. every book should either have a chapter like this or a sequel.unless i didn't like the book. then it shouldn't have anything.OVERALLthis is still coming it at a close third in austen rankings for moi (afteremmaandpride & prejudice) but damn is it still good. that letter! that yearning! anne being a Nice Girl who isn't boring!what a gift!rating: 5---------------general updateNETFLIX ADAPTATION STARRING DAKOTA JOHNSON AND HENRY GOLDING THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!---------------reread updateif you ever have the opportunity to spend an hour or so rereading this in a park on an unseasonably warm fall day, i recommend you take it---------------original reviewfind a long version of my original review + a review of sense & sensibility athttps://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...!"

        "user_review": "There's something about this novel, out of all Jane Austen's work, that wounds me with so much tenderness. It's been weeks, and I feel likePersuasionis still excavating feelings from me.Persuasionis heartbreakingly lovely. In this novel, Austen accesses the universal—how we love, how we yearn, how we survive in perpetual loss—by painting a very intimate portrait of a woman caught in the never-ending ache of love and sorrow. It's a story about regret and family, about loss and remembrance, about the past and the future, about fear and uncertainty and desire and our attempts and failures to love people and to stand up for ourselves.Persuasionhas been called Austen's most mature novel. It's an apt description for the last novel Austen completed in her lifetime. InPersuasion, Austen's irony feels more subdued but somehow more heightened for all its subtlety. The critique of British society that Austen routes through Anne's social exclusion is sharp, exposing what lurks beneath social surfaces, the vacuous performance of class, and the tragedy of young women so full of life yet isolated, confined to a straitly defined existence by selfish societies that predicate their worth on how useful they can be. The story is also more melancholy—suffused with the sense of an ending, approaching, inexorable—even as it wades through the darkness with heart. And where Austen's earlier novels are about the wide-eyed wildness of youth and first love,Persuasionis instead the tale ofaftermath: of what happens after love has been found and lost, when all the details of youth have faded away and one can no longer afford to be so careless, so unfettered, and so unburdened.When we meet Anne, she is blank and bereft, undone with pain and hiding it in plain sight. Since giving up Wentworth—an indelible failure, marked on Anne as surely as a scar—her life has become like a wall which she runs against and can go no further. The years had slipped away so absurdly fast, protected by the silences and acquiescences that dull loss, and Anne remained only more awkward in her own body, terrified of the space it takes up. Austen does such a good job of involving us in Anne's feelings, revealing them as simply as one lifts back a sheet: Anne's loneliness which she cannot explain to anyone, her matchless ability to suffer quietly, her selflessness (or rather her constant surrender to theselfishnessof others), her naked desire to be useful, to be needed, which only conceals an unbearable longing to bewanted.When Anne sees Wentworth again, taking him whole into her eyes—his solidity, his carefulness, and the subtlest hints of pain too—she feels the shock of that old love between them, a piercing echo of those old conflicts which have never resolved in her. A feeling that, for Anne, mingled sweetness, longing, and sorrow. But Anne and Wentworth have been apart long enough to know the shape of each other's absence, and Wentworth's love for Anne seems to have been drained to the dregs, leaving nothing but a hard crust of disdain and resentment behind. Now that he is back, it seems inconceivable to Anne that they might go back, heal what is laying so badly between them, as if they had each already crossed to the opposite sides of some tremendous divide. Everything has been said, and there is nothing more to say. They've each made their choices, built lives untouched by the other, and became different people, unrecognizable to each other. Now there is only the need to leave one another… but they can't quite bring themselves to do it.So goesPersuasion, a novel that probes, painstakingly, at those terrible spaces that always seem to lie between people who are filled with things they cannot articulate without the countervailing threat of rejection or separation, the terrible gulfs that have to be crossed for even a simple touching, for the faintest hints of recognition. Throughout the novel, Anne and Wentworth are like two people stuck in connecting rooms with the door shut between them, which they aim to find in the dark but miss each time—everything separates them, even their efforts to join each other. Austen captures it all: the sense of how tender, difficult, and deeply complicated our attachments to people are, the pain and humiliation we purposefully endure in the name of love, and above all, the danger of going through our whole lives missing each other but never finding out who we are to one another.Austen makes us taste the unspeakable, unbearable, vanished agony of such a possibility, but thankfully, never realizes it. Hope runs quietly throughPersuasion, beneath every thread of conversation between Wentworth and Anne, like the simmer of distant thunder. But there is, still, something that hurts so much in all of this. As if Austen has written a happier version for a story that has already ended badly. That story haunts the pages, a reminder that the tragedy does not lie upon the lost years that Anne and Wentworth spent apart, deprived of each other. The tragedy lies upon the fact that Anne and Wentworth might have spent the rest of their lives aiming to find each other and missing each time—until they lost sight completely of one another. Longing as a lifetime sentence, sighing for something beyond our reach, forever inconsolable.(By the way, I'm still so mad at Netflix for ruining this masterpiece. Like... Jail to everyone involved.)"

        "user_review": "One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma).For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \"best\":\"Pride and Prejudice\" (the popular choice, and my wife's)\"Emma\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one)\"Persuasion\" (the truly refined choice)Harrold Bloom in \"The Western Canon\" calls it perhaps a \"perfect novel,\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment.While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \"Persuasion\" is the most nuanced. It's been described as \"autumnal\" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work.The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \"Sense and Sensibility.\" Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine. In fact, she's dangerously close to being \"over the hill\" at the age of 27(!). Love has passed her by, apparently.But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne. She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially. When we meet her, she's barely there at all. Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters. In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her.This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger.This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist.I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since. I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27. It's one of my favorite memories.More than any other of her novels, \"Persuasion\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters. Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all.Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence. While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers.Having said that, \"Persuasion\" is simply the best of the best."

However, I quickly was swept up into the story and felt all of Anne's emotions like they were my own. I really enjoyed how, unlike the other Austen novels I've read, this one focuses on love lost and how, over time, people change in some ways but remain the same in other ways. Anne and Captain Wentworth aren't my favorite Austen characters, but I still very much enjoyed how they were forced to face many obstacles, reflect, and mature before getting their happily ever after. My only complaint is that I wish we got to know more about Captain Wentworth, so I could feel the love for him as strongly as Anne does."

        "user_review": "Jane Austen is ruthless and brilliant; she is sarcastic, subtle and superbly witty. She writes in such a matter of fact way that the absurdity of her characters is in plain sight. Sir Walter Elliot is a complete fool. Austen doesn't need to tell her reader this, she shows it to them. The man is completely bankrupt, but he completely refuses to cut down on his ridiculously high expenditure or sell of any of his lands. He is so obsessed with his outer image that he risks all to keep it in a state of, what he perceives as, perfection.Then there is the way he perceives his daughters. Elizabeth is vain and stupid like her farther, but, to him, she is wonderful. She adheres to the strict code of womanly/daughterly custom; she is also a self-absorbed flatterer; thus, her pig headed farther loves her dearly. The protagonist Anne, on the other hand, is intelligent, kind and occasionally speaks her mind; thus, her father and sister view her as furniture. She is \"only Anne.\" There is no affection for the younger sister because she isn't so fixated upon her outer image. She is pushed aside and rarely listened to. At the start of the novel, this is so much so, that it doesn't even feel like she is present. The initially quiet heroine is overshadowed by her overbearing farther and the ridiculous nature of society.And now, with Austen at my back, I'm going to slate Sir Walter to death. Let's start with the opening of the book. Just look at the mastery of the tone:\"SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch-hall, in Somerset- shire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt. As he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century—and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed—this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:\"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH-HALL.\"This symbolises is high self-regard along with his obsession with his personal status; it is all that is important to him: it is all he wants to read about. As a result, he spends hours reading and editing the entries, and turns to it when in need of comfort. Traditionally, the book that would be taken in an individual's time of need would be the Bible. This demonstrates that to Sir Walter, his status is the most important aspect of his life; it's all he truly cares about. There is also a degree of significance in the fact that all the edits Sir Walter makes are past instances, there are no new entries to signify the recent decrease in monetary fortune. The book, and him, both belong in the past; he is constantly looking back at his family's foundations, but doing very little, prior to Lady Russel's intervention, to actually improve their current situation. This is both comic and contemptible because when his estate is falling into ruin, he only cares about its outward appearance making him a caricature of the old class; it, suggests that they, perhaps, need to go or at the very least change.This is where the new, more attractive, navel gentlemen come in. The idea of what constituted gentlemen was becoming more flexible during the Romantic era and nineteenth century. Previously, the higher societies predominantly consisted of those who received their status at birth: the landed gentry. The idea of what makes a gentleman was moving forward with the changing opportunities afforded by the Napoleonic wars. The war meant that men from common birth like Admiral Croft and Captains Wentworth and Benwick, could climb the social ladder due to fortune and title granted by successful soldering. They'd earnt the money that was associated with a higher place within society. They could enter it with a degree of equality.-Captain WentworthSo, worthy men have an increase in fortune; they've earnt their rank. But Sir Walter, as caricature of the old class, opposes this notion vehemently. This can be seen with, you guessed it, is obsession with outer appearance. This time it's with his physical beauty. He artificially attempts to cling to his youth, which can be seen when he converses with Anne later in the novel. He has a surprisingly large amount of knowledge about skin treatments that defy age. His self-absorbency with his physical appearance is symbolic of his perceived appearance within society. To him, a gentleman is supposed to possess certain outward qualities. He finds the idea of Admiral Croft disturbing, common and ungentlemanly. He remarks that he has only two objections to sailors:\"First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cut's up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man; I have observed it all my life.\"According to him, this can lead to one becoming an object of disgust such as Admiral Baldwin who is \"all lines and wrinkles\" and \"rough and rugged to the last degree.\" Sir Walter is practically disgusted at this \"wretched life\" of a sea fairer. Never mind the fact that he has spent his life in service to his, and Sir Walter's, country, which contrasts with how Sir Walter has spent his whole life in service to himself. Yet, his position in society is higher and more esteemed. The navy is deserves his respect; they helped to facilitate an England that remained under English rule and not one under the thumb of Napoleon Bonaparte.The disapproval of Sir Walter is suggestive of Austen's approval. She is arguing for the benefits of a system like the navy; it promotes its members based upon merit and due distinction. This is in direct contrast to the old system that Sir Walter reveres. There is a certain degree of irony in the fact that Admiral Croft can afford to live in Sir Walter's home when Sir Walter cannot. It is a symbolic demotion, one that leaves the self-made man living in deserved splendour. This is where Austen uses free indirect style to suggest that the narrator's opinions are similar to our protagonist's. She has a choice between the old breed of gentry, a man resembling her father's class, or a young romantic naval officer who represents the benefits of an increase in social mobility. It's obvious which one she chooses. Anne is not a fool. She was persuaded once, but she now sees with clarity and focus. She can see the worth of the two men and knows which one is worth her time.-William Elliot (The young shadow of Sir Walter)From analysing the representation of the contrasting gentlemen, it becomes apparent that Austen gives social mobility positive connotations. Sir Walter Elliot remains in a position of higher social rank, but his so called social inferiors are afforded with gentlemen like qualities, ones that he so clearly lacks. They are admitted to high social circles despite their birth. They possess more honour, sense and purpose than the old class of gentlemen that Sir Walter represents. Therefore, when a man such a Sir Walter, one who is vein and self-obsessed, is resistant to the idea of social mobility, it becomes rather difficult not to be persuaded by the benefits of its progress that Austen evokes.I love Jane Austen's novels. Admittedly, I've only read two, but I can already see the brilliance of the author. Her novels are so subtly clever with hidden suggestions. I really admire what she does. I'm sticking with my rule from here on out though. I attest that each Austen novel needs to be read at least twice, perhaps even thrice, to get the full effect of what she does. I missed so much of it on my initial reading. It's quite surprising, but sometimes you need to have seen the entire picture before you can judge each individual part. There's just so much to take from this. I've only focused on one angle in my review, though there is so much going on. I've actually cut this down a little because it was starting to get far too long for a review. This is an English student's dream. I need to go and read more Austen novels! Why can't I have an entire module on her!Facebook|Twitter|Insta|Academia"

Things can get pretty dark without seeing a perspective.Readers however can rely on a priceless panacea : when our own thoughts, emotions or tribulations simply are getting too much, we can at least escape or find relief by submerging into someone else's by picking the right book. During the first lockdownPersuasionwas such a book for me. How not to care for Anne Elliot? She turned out an ideal heroine, making me forget for a few hours my own woes purely by empathizing with hers and eventually exulting in the happiness that will be her part.A delectable novel, incarnate grace."

Persuasion's way of empathizing with the protagonist felt to be in a much deeper level, while most experiences of Anne Elliot are easily relatable for the reader - fore those were a lot real and less fictional. However, the majority of other characters does share the characteristics of pride, vanity and prejudice which all other books did have in common.\"It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.\"As for how well written everything is: it is incredibly fulfilling. I don't understand how it was possible for the author to do so, but everything is narrated perfectly. In retrospect, had I disliked any part or even most of the story, even then, I sure would've loved this book, for, the way each sentence is written is amazing, and it will keep the reader immersed thoroughly. Now add it to the fact the story itself being great, and it is not a surprise that we have one of the best books of all time.\"My idea of good company, Mr. Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;\"\"There are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.\""

Now, it is 8 years later, and she bumps into him again.What will the predictable Jane Austen do?The only redeeming quality of Persuasion is Anne's family. They think that they are so great, but the only thing that they have managed to do is run their estate into the ground and tell themselves how awesome they are for doing next to nothing.As for the Netflix video that was such a scandal, I thought it was great.

Everything seems to combine to prevent Anne and Captain Wentworth from ever being able to come to an understanding again: his bitter feelings, her faded looks (mostly through unhappiness; she's only 28 or 29), and other, younger girls vying for his attention, which he's only too happy to give them.Austen's intelligence, dry wit and humor are evidenced on every page. The melancholy, autumnal feel of the first part of the book, when all you can see is Anne's blighted hopes and how she is disregarded and mistreated by almost everyone around her, is wrenching. Then, like springtime, comes the slow, gradual return of joy and hope to Anne's life.I loved the energy and achievements of the military characters, as opposed to the stagnant, superficial aristocracy. And mostly: That Letter. *sigh*I do have a few beefs: The actual writing here doesn't seem as nuanced and deep as some of Austen's other works. The characters tend to be a little bit one-dimensional: Anne Elliot is so unfailingly noble and kind and self-sacrificing; her family members are so invariably shallow and hard-hearted and self-centered. I got quite tired of Anne's nerves or whatever getting overwrought and her needing to retire to meditate in solitude to recover her self-possession; it happened All. The. Time. Anyone who thinks Fanny inMansfield Parkis a bit of a stick in the mud needs to take a closer look at Anne. And the last line of the book is still vaguely anticlimactic to me; I keep thinking Jane might have come up with a better ending if she'd had more time to polish the book.Still, there's so much to love inPersuasion, and the good far outweighs the bad for me. And I'm a romantic and a hopeful person at heart, so the persistence of love through the years, and the ability of the characters (with a little luck) to work through injured pride on the one side, and unsupportive family and friends on the other, and find lasting happiness together, warms my heart."

        "user_review": "Persuasionis said to be the best work of Jane Austen. While I have reservations on that point, I do see why it is said so.Persuasionis quite different from most of her preceding work. In many of them, her writing is light and glows with \"sparkle and spirit\". But inPersuasion, her spirited and sparkle writing is replaced by more mature writing. It is still light but there are more warmth and emotion in her writing as well as more depth and colour. In short, Jane Austen has written Persuasion with so much feeling to make it stand tall among all her other work.The main female protagonist, Anne Elliot, is a mature heroine who has lost her \"youth and bloom\" over the years as a result of her pining for a lost love. She is unloved and neglected by the family except by the dear friend Lady Russel. But she is courageous and has a superior, cultivated mind to bear all indifference and to endure her loss without resentment. Anne reminded me of Cinderella; the only difference was that she had an indifferent father instead of a wicked stepmother. Anne is strong. She is self-made, kind, and has a keen intelligence. She secures her happiness more or less by her means supported by circumstances rather than any support rendered by family or friends. Anne stands out from most of Austen heroines. Perhaps she is equal in stamina to the much loved Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. And I don't know if it is because of my partiality and obsession with Elizabeth Bennet over the years, but I couldn't help feeling that Anne is sort of a mature version of Elizabeth, only that Elizabeth would not have been easily persuaded.Captain Wentworth is yet another beloved hero and could easily be placed in line with Darcy, Knightley, and Colonel Brandon. I'm amazed at Jane Austen's ability to create these heroes and heroines who are felt so real and who would undoubtedly occupy a place in all reader's hearts. No Austen hero or heroine is ever forgotten and for centuries they have survived to become \"immortal\".Like in all Jane Austen's work, Persuasion too has a sweet love story. But unlike in others, it is a mature love; one that was found, lost, and found again; one that has endured an eight and half years of separation. And what is more striking is Austen's excellent and emotional writing of Anne's feelings: her pain and suffering for having given up the man she loved; her painful situation at having to meet him after eight and half years; her pain at his cool reception of her; her agony in watching of him pursue another woman very much younger than her; her knowledge that her once pretty looks and youth have been robbed over the years and she would no longer be attractive in his eyes.; her knowledge that she has lost her chance to be happy again; and above all her profound realization that she still loved him deeply and dearly. All these emotions are detailed and beautifully and touchingly expressed that they almost broke my heart.In addition, there is also Austen's social commentary, criticism, and realism. Through the characters of Sir Walter, Elizabeth, and Mary, she exposes the vanity of the titled and mocks them for their air of superiority. At the same time, she gently hints at the decline of superiority maintained by the titled class through the declining in a wealth of Sir Walter and shows the emergence of a new wealthy class in Naval Officers who would gradually elevate their position in the society with their wealth, gaining respect and admiration. Two brothers of Jane Austen were Navy officers and perhaps, this was her tribute to them.Overall, it is a beautiful book. I loved every minute of reading it. And I believe this will be my most favourite of Jane Austen novel."

She was all,I was right to listen to advice from my elders, but she did admit that they should have revisited thehe's not eligablesituation a lot sooner.Also, she was kind of doing the best she could with what she had to work with back in the day. And honestly, how was she (at such a young age) to know the difference between a guy whosayshe's going to work hard and make it big anddoes, and a guy whosayshe's going to work hard and make it big, but turns out to be a lazy doofus?Because we all know that one poor idiot who didn't ask enough questions, thought that love was the only thing you needed, and trusted in her man'sgood sensetoo much.tskSo, yes. Annedidlose the love of her life due to caution. But! She alsodidn'tend up with some hippie stoner who sat on her couch all day and talked about his plans to teach the cat to play the harmonica.Life's a balancing act, ladies.I like this one. Anne isn't some twit who sits around blubbering about it, but you also get that she loved Frederick very much. It's the age-old story ofthe one that got awayand you're genuinely rooting for her the entire time.I gotta admit, I wasn't all that crazy about him at the beginning of the book when it looked like he was flirting with the cute young ladies in front of her. But then I realized that she had broken his seafaring heart into sad little pieces, and maybe he deserved a bit of payback.Ok, so the most memorable part of the story to me was this scene where this married couple were driving along in their carriage and she kept telling him how to drive. <--you nailed it, Jane!Just goes to show you, underneath it all, things aren't really much different.And it's nice to know that people have always been kind of nuts.Recommended for Austen fans.Greta Scacchi was the narrator of the audiobook I listened to and she did a lovely job if you're interested in listening rather than reading."

        "user_review": "Dear Miss Austen,Ummm... Anne Elliot is past her youth and bloom??? Heh? She isMY AGE!Scratch that - she isyoungerthan me.[image error]..........Basically, get off my lawn, kids. I mean it..............In all seriousness, this is the first Jane Austen book that does not feature a pretty and charming teenager looking for a perfect match in a cultured and rich gentleman.Instead, her protagonist Anne Elliot is well into the respectable age of seven-and-twenty, equipped with composure and maturity that only age can bring.(Hey, maybe advanced age is not so bad, after all! But I happily maintain that mentally I'm still eleven. Oh, and as I said, get off my lawn!)Anne finds herself in a quite uncomfortable situation. Years ago, she was engaged to a dashing young sailor whom she subsequently rejected on the well-meaning but ultimately flawed advice of a trusted friend. Now that sailor, having transformed into a respectable and well-to-do, and still dashing Captain Wentworth, reenters Anne's circle of acquaintances, clearly still resenting Anne, and appears to be actively looking for a younger prettier future spouse. All that while Anne, ruined by age(just kidding, she is still quite pretty, as it turns out)realizes she still harbors her old affection for him but needs(of course!)to maintain all the necessary societal proprieties.On top of all of that, Anne has the most rotten family!Her father is a pathetic handsome gentleman unhealthily obsessed with his own good looks(I mean, the man has a bedroom full of mirrors! Puh-lease.)Her younger sister will claw your eyes out if she were to think you'd eclipse her as a center of attention even for a minute(this is a woman who feels slighted if her dying son gets more attention than she does), and will spend hours sending little verbal put-downs in Anne's direction while shamelessly using her help for anything imaginable. And yet, this pathetic creature is still \"not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth\", the older sister.\"To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all.\"And all of Anne's family members seem to compete with each other in how to best put down Anne- the treatment that she easily sees but tolerates without complaining and in good spirits. Oh, and they have to downsize because all the vain and shallow family members are quite rotten at preserving the family fortune.Basically, to sum up:.Anne Elliot is a well-mannered, reasonable, proper, and sensible heroine. Good thing she is NOT the one narrating this story, or it would have been quite bland. Instead, we are treated to aquite snarky(albeit within strict early-19th-century British sensibilities)narrative voice, picking apart all of our characters and their environment with a lovely and a bit sarcastic commentary.Ah, Miss Austen, you were really getting fed up with your well-mannered society, weren't you?And I love it.I love how delightfully drama-free this story is.No huge events, no shocking twists, nothing except for reasonable behavior and not-too-exciting provincial life(well, in all honesty, excepting two near-fatal falls, at least one of which was getting me all worried about epidural vs. subdural hematoma, which is no joke). The only hint of strong passion is in a short letter from Wentworth to Anne, and even then the declaration of love is done in a subdued epistolary form. And it is precisely this quiet flow of the story that creates an enjoyable atmosphere, strangely............................\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"And another thing that I came to appreciate is theattempt to decry the classism of English society. The most admirable people in this book are not the gentlemen by birth, unlike the proverbial Mr. Darcy(ughh)but the naval officers and their circles - Wentworth and the Crofts especially. It's like Austen was finally acknowledging that it's not only the birth into the gentry class that makes you a decent person. Way to go, Miss Austen! Congratulations on succeeding in making all your hypocritical gentlemen with overblown feeling of self-importance appear to be total idiots like they should be:\"A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line.\"A lovely3.5-starbook. It does not quite reach the 4-star enjoyment ofJane Eyre, butit is a delightful book with which to spend an overcast day filled with bronchitis cough.\"Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits. She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character.\""

        "user_review": "While ploughing through Lucy Ellmann'sDucks, Newburyportrecently, the frequent references to Jane Austen'sPersuasionprompted me to take this neat book down from its place on a high shelf alongside its five sisters and keep it within view as a kind of incentive to finish Ellmann's 1000 page tome.As it turned out, I didn't need an incentive to finishDucksbecause it self-propelled in the second half, but even so, I still offered myself the pleasure of re-readingPersuasiononce I'd finished it. There's nothing I like better than when one book leads naturally to another without me having to scratch my head and wonder what might make a good follow-on to what I've been immersed in.The narrator ofDucksis well versed in all of Jane Austen's novels. She ponders on the dilemma of Marianne and Willoughby fromSense and Sensibilitywhen confronted with an issue between her temperamental daughter and a good-for-nothing boyfriend. She mentions Emma Woodhouse a few times, and several characters fromPride and Prejudicetoo—indeed Mrs Bennett's famous line, \"You have no compassion for my poor nerves\" becomes a kind of unspoken mantra in Ellmann's book.But the Austen character who is most often referenced is Anne Elliot, the main character ofPersuasion. Ellmann's narrator identifies strongly with Anne. They both spent their childhoods in beautiful houses which their families no longer have access to. They are both very attached to the memory of their mothers whom they lost in their early teens, and the loss of the mother continues to influence their lives in different ways.Of course the two books are very different in other respects, Ellmann's being a wide-ranging commentary on contemporary world issues, and including vast numbers of references to film, literature and poetry, while Austen's is a very contained account of a little slice of English life in the early 1800s, with very few literary references. The two such references I found are brief and easily glossed over—if I noticed them in previous reads, I moved on from them just as quickly. But I'm a different reader now and I love to find hints of other works in the literature I read. The first reference I spotted was to 18th century poet, Mathew Prior'sHenry and Emmawhich tells of a test of loyalty which a lover imposes on his loved one: Emma must overcome a series of challenges in order to prove her constancy to Henry. Austen inserts the reference to Prior's poem just when Anne Elliot is being asked by the man she has loved for years to nurse back to health the girl he now seems to be in love with, so the story of Henry setting trials for Emma seems very apt indeed. And as we read on through Anne Elliot's story, we see the parallel more and more as Anne's constancy is further tested.The second literary reference I came across is less significant to the plot and more connected to Austen's people-watching skills, the aspect of her writing I admire the most. How perceptive of people's foibles she must have been to be able to transfer to the page brief character sketches which manage to contain a host of subtle information especially relating to the more ludicrous traits of the personalities of her characters. In her other novels, there are portraits of ridiculous figures aplenty: Mrs Bennet, Mr Collins, Miss Bates, Mr Woodhouse, and several others I could mention, but surely none are so comically outrageous as super-conceited Sir Walter Eliot and his equally puffed-up daughters Elizabeth and Mary. The very modest Anne Eliot is sorely tried, as if she needed the extra challenge, in having them for family!However, there is one occasion when Anne makes an effort to put herself forward in the pushy manner of her family, but she is immediately self-aware enough to laugh at herself for the attempt :She could not do so, without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles.As there is no character called Miss Larolles in this book, and Jane Austen doesn't elaborate further, I guessed the inimitable Miss Larolles must be a literary figure who would be familiar to Austen's readers. And so she is, as I found when I looked her up. She is a very ridiculous character from Fanny Burney'sCecilia, which was written about thirty five years before Austen wrotePersuasion. As I've never read anything by Fanny Burney, I decided there and then to beginCeciliaas soon as I finishedPersuasionwhich I did all too quickly.Burney's is a long book, quite as long asDucks, Newburyport, but I'm happily reading it at the moment, finding other parallels with Austen's books, and relieved once again that one book has led me directly to another."

I'm not a huge reader of classics-- a fact i'm working on rectifying-- so when I wasn't very much enjoying the first two chapters, I got nervous. But as soon as I pushed through to the heart of the storyline, I began to crave in-class discussions over this book. I absolutely loved Anne as a main character, and Captain Wentworth was such a fitting companion for her that I was hooked, dying to find out how their lives played out. This book made me feel a lot of things-- especially the feeling that comes with crying at 4 AM about fictional men-- and I'm thoroughly surprised that such an old book still remains touching and relatable. I just wish that Austen implemented more dialogue in her writing, which is why I took off half a star; I feel like sometimes the book was bogged down with too many paragraphs of thought and not enough spoken word. But regardless, I am definitely intending on picking up Pride & Prejudice soon to see if it grabs me just as much as this one!"

        "user_review": "It is always a pleasure to immerse ourselves in Jane Austen's work, especially its original English version!I like this author. However, Persuasion didn't pardon the pun; it persuaded me. I found that one slipped on the plot without going into the deep feelings of Anne Elliot, who is supposed to be the main character.I say \"supposed\" because the young woman is ultimately not put forward. She is present throughout the novel but only exists concerning the other characters. Her own love story only comes in the last chapters.Maybe that's what disappointed me about this book. Still, perhaps it was also Jane Austen's goal to show how young girls in 19th-century English society only exist through their social condition and the place that their male entourage is willing to grant it.The writing is still relatively fluid, and the novel is without too many lengths (even if, it must admit, not much is happening).It was a pleasant reading, especially the \"British 19th-century\" side."

        "user_review": "What can I possibly tell you about Jane Austen? I really enjoyed this. I really like that by the end you get to move a bit out of the head of the main character, away from her self-deprecations and almost masochistic lacerations and get to see what Captain Wentworth actually did think of her – rather than her-less-than-self-congratulatory version.Okay, it is all very romantic – but what I found most interesting in this book was how I felt compelled to consider how much of the world we learn by having it reported to us. There is the life we live and know first hand, well, more or less, and then there is the world that we know from 'trusted sources'. And all of this adds to make up the whole of our perspective of 'reality', whatever that might be.There is always a layer of reality below which we can only ever guess at – and that is what is really going on in the minds of others. Sometimes we do discover something of this – and that might either bring joy or pain – but otherwise we construct and reconstruct the world on the best narrative we can make from the frowns or smiles of those around us, glimpsed however imperfectly in the twinkling of a moment.A while ago I took a very dear friend of mine to the local art gallery and showed her a couple of little statue things they have there of two old women. The artist has created these two miniature people – two homunculi who are engrossed in the conversation they whisper between themselves. If you view them from the front they look to be talking away quite contentedly – almost conspiratorially - but as you move around to view them from the back you see that one of them looks very anxious, perhaps almost about to cry, perhaps oddly frightened. This fear isn't something you notice at all from the front. But in life we don't get to have this 360 degree perspective on the people we meet and talk to – and so only one of these views is open to us. The guesses we make on the motivations and desires of others are always partial, always mixed up with our own motivations and desires and misattributions.So it is that Anne Elliot spends much of the novel – perhaps a woman a little too good for this world. She can even watch on with quiet resignation as the man she loves seems to be choosing someone else to marry.There are many interesting themes in this book – class distinctions and their worth in judging the value of someone, when to take the advice of someone and when not to, how jealousy has much to recommend it in regaining the love of your ex. But one of the things I was most interested in was the theme of 'love and property' which Marx and Engels talk about in the Manifesto. It is a knee jerk reaction now to say we should marry for love – but in the immortal words of an Irish folk song:\"Love is pleasingAnd love is teasingAnd love is a pleasure when first it's newBut as it grows olderSure the love grows colder'Til it fades away like the morning dew.\"This is a romance, so we don't get to see this happen to our protagonists, but the relationships of those around them would hardly make one seek to rush into the married state. From the bizarre and almost incestuous relationship between Anne's father and her older sister, to the marriage of her younger sister, Mary – and the marriage of Benwick to Louisa is surely destined to crash and burn.Everyone in Anne's family is unspeakably awful – when Austen wants to create a character that is a pain in the bum she does so with unerring perception. Mary and her father are masterworks in the description of the obnoxious in human form – the botched soul.Ms Austen also obviously had a bit of a thing for the 'strong, silent types' (think Mr Darcy without the fairytale quest bit in the middle) – but there is also something of the Enlightenment about this book. The idea that real feeling, the hope of a truly happy marriage, can only be based on the common rationality of the couple at hand. Love is a mingling of minds, rather than bodies. And this isn't some sort of nineteenth century prudishness, or at least, not only, but more a hypothesis that is played out in the marriages of the major characters.Love, then, is a version of that highest type of friendship that our old mate Aristotle was so fond of – and that life cruelly teaches us is so incredibly rare for us with people of either sex. To have both sexual attraction and mental attraction with one single 'other person' is perhaps really asking too much and just being greedy.Still, I guess all would be well if not for those damn hormones. And of everyone in the book poor old Benwick probably cops the worst press - for not being constant enough to the memory of his recently departed ex-wife. The discussion at this point reminded me a bit of Hamlet whinging about his mum and uncle. But this does all end up with that most wonderful of quotes – where Anne says that women may not love deeper, but that they do love longer, even after all hope is gone. If you are going to get a slap in a piece of classic fiction, it is probably best that it happen in a way that results in such a line. The fact she is almost moved to tears after saying this line and that it is basically the turning point of the entire book really is a lovely thing.If only in life it could be that saying the utterly perfect thing would reap such rich rewards… But then, I guess that does rather put the onus on finding the utterly perfect thing to say."

        "user_review": "to persuade (verb)\"to make someone do or believe something by giving them a good reason to do it or by talking to that person and making them believe it\"Jane Austen delivers a PERSUASIVE analysis of the concept of PERSUASION, slowly PERSUADING the reader that being of a PERSUADABLE temper, commonly regarded as a virtue in young women of her time, is a weakness and a barrier to personal happiness.Why?The answer is quite simple, and still as valid as two centuries ago: more often than not, the kind, caring and sensitive characters tend to be PERSUADABLE, whereas the egotistical, narcissistic, and stubborn bullies tend to be PERSUASIVE.Anne Elliot, the classical Cinderella in a vain, ambitious and superficial family, sacrifices her love to accommodate the pride and prejudice of those who call themselves her friends and allies. Eight years pass during which she PERSUADES herself that her role is that of a supporting member of the family, patiently attending to the tantrums of her sisters and accepting the disregard of her conceited father.When her former love unexpectedly enters the stage again, they both remain PERSUADED that the other one is lost forever, and play a PERSUASIVE game of dissimulation before finally reaching the PERSUASION that love conquers all - even society's coercive directives.The lesson learned from this social study is that there is hardly a case in which PERSUASION is unbiased and truly beneficial. The moment a person needs to be convinced to do something against his or her natural inclination, all kinds of complications, sacrifices and frustrations are likely to follow.Listen to yourself before you listen to PERSUASIVE bullies, is my PERSUASION, after reading Jane Austen.I was thus a PERSUADABLE reader."

        "user_review": "It's a worrisome affair if you have to plod through an Austen work all the while unsuccessfully battling the urge to slap more than half of the central characters. And this comes from someone who is well-accustomed to Austen's often whiny, vain, and hilariously self-deluded characters who serve as comedy gold and tools of subtle social commentary. But somehow in this posthumously published work, I feel she focused her attentions on lathering an extra layer of vindictiveness on to many of the players. Additionally, the first three quarters of the narrative progressed in the most lacklustre manner possible with little to no development on any front. No dramatic confrontations, emotionally charged conversations, simmering sexual tension or witty, flirty banter to spice things up. The overwhelming blandness of it all felt too close to real life situations.But of course, this is Austen. The same woman whose remarkable insight on the condition of women is reflected in a letter to one of her correspondents a hundred years ago.Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor-which is one very strong argument in favour of Matrimony.The same woman who rescued the English novel from the tenacious grip of the age of sentiment and genre trope hysterics of the gothic novel to give it a truly modern form. The same woman who tried to challenge the laws that governed social interaction of the times by placing as great an emphasis on moral behaviour as on class-based identity.And this very same woman makes Anne Elliot her mouthpiece while arraigning the convention of woman-shaming that contemporary male novelists upheld with gusto and a latent smugness.Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove any thing.So yes my dwindling interest in the book and abrupt loss of faith in Austen's brilliance lasted only for a few disappointing pages before she turned things around quite climactically. At the ripe age of twenty-seven, Anne Elliot maybe one of Austen's least remarkable heroines. Neither does she possess Emma's sass and cool confidence nor does she exude Elizabeth's unwavering self-esteem and channel a sardonic indifference towards her social superiors. And yet she never backs down from defending members of her own sex from unsavory remarks based on hollow prejudices.It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof. We each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex, and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has ocurred within our circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said.So persuasion. The excellence of this book's central premise is that it establishes Anne Elliot as a woman who is consistent in love and errs only on the side of caution even though outwardly she is perceived as a pushover, one who yields easily to persuasion and incitement. Long story short, Austen ingeniously misled both her hero and her reader to the wrong conclusions about the heroine. And she knew how exactly to subvert the power dynamics of hierarchical social structures while simultaneously preserving the veneer of conformity. If that's not genius, I don't know what is."

        "user_review": "Persuasion by Jane Austen is a 2016 Enhanced Media publication. (Originally published in 1817)A wonderfully pleasant classic by one of my favorite writers.When I was invited to review a new book, the premise of which, is a modern -day retelling of Jane Austen'sPersuasion, I accepted immediately.But, once I'd signed on, it occurred to me that I didn't remember any of the details ofPersuasion. Surely, since Jane Austen has written some of my very favorite books, and I consider her to be one of my top five favorite authors, I have read every one of her books, right? Maybe I just needed a refresher. But, for the life of me, I have no memory of ever having read this one.So, despite my tight reading schedule, I just had to stop the assembly line and squeeze this one in.While there are already plenty of reviews for this book, I just wanted to share my experience of it with you.Up front, I must confess, this book, while listed as a favorite by many, is not mine, mainly because of the time it took to get to the meat of the story, and I felt the momentum dragged in some places.However, I did appreciate the more serious tone, the way Anne managed to dodge traditional female roles, and for her time, she is written as a strong, mature, character, who didn't mind pointing out the advantages men had in the way of education and the way they often thought of women as being 'inconstant'. She wasn't exactly ironical, but she makes her point. I loved that!I also enjoyed the themes explored, concerning character traits, and the misjudgment, or maybe the PRE- judgment of those traits, while also touching on the disadvantages of remaining totally one- dimensional. This story also delves into the complexities of family, friendship, and of course love, and is well balanced and rounded.The writing of course is quite different from what we are accustomed to, or I should say, what I'm accustomed to, and at times the wordiness was challenging, but I did appreciate the manners, and activities described, and the characterizations.While this one isn't quite as sharp as other Austen novels, in my opinion, and is a just a bit more pensive than usual, I still found myself looking forward to the time I could spend with Anne inside her pre-Victorian landscape.4 stars"

        "user_review": "Wow.Like so many people, I read this book because my book club chose it. Unlike so many people, I am not impressed. Not even a little bit. A lot of times when a book is rated this high, I tend to think it's me and not the book. But nope. This time I fully believe it's the book.This will be ranty and in the order in which things made me want to rant. No apologies.I should've known things weren't going to go well from the title alone. Crayfish are all over the place, but they don't sing in any of those places.*I definitely knew this wasn't the book for me on the very first page. I absolutely abhor overwrought prose that reads like the author sat down with the intention of writing the next Great American Novel and therefore had a certain number of adjectives and metaphors to fit on each page to prove their work was worth the accolades it was sure to get with sentences like:\"Swamp water is still and dark, having swallowed the light inits muddy throat. Even night crawlers are diurnal in this lair. There are sounds, of course, but compared to the marsh, the swamp is quiet because decomposition is cellular work. Life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff; a poignant wallow of death begetting life.\"There is beautiful imagery, and then there is pretentious cobbling together of SAT words and figurative language so it seems deep but really isn't. For me, this was the latter. And so much of the book is just that overly flowery language barfed over every page for no reason, saying nothing or not making a lick of sense with what it does say. But it sounds pretty! So! Art!Then there was the massive eye-brow raising I did when I discovered this was taking place in North Carolina. The dialect. AGHHHHH!!!! This is why authors shouldn't use dialect when they write. You have to know a place so well in order to do that. Southern hick does not equal southern hick does not equal southern hick. There are (at the very least) five different dialects spoken in North Carolina. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone. The majority of my professors could tell which region each NC native was from by a couple sentences. I had a few who could get within two counties of where they were born after hearing them speak. Yeah. Kya's father's dialect would be exceedingly different from everyone else in their community as he is from the mountains and they are in the Outer Banks. Those are so distinctive and nothing alike. No one else in the world speaks like the Pamlico Sound people of NC. And it is rather hard to capture its cadence and brogue on page so just don't try. You will fail. (Owens totally failed.)Is that nit-picky? Maybe. But I'm more concerned with how the dialect was used. Every \"good\" person in the book overcame their dialect to learn to speak \"proper\" (ugh I hate even typing that word) English. Are you telling me Kya, who didn't have TV or radio as influence, lost her dialect with no practice and no outside influence because she was just...smart??? Good???? Same with Tate. But Chase kept his so we knew he was bad and a threat. There's some classist nonsense imbedded deep in that, and I am not here for it in any way. It's particularly annoying as it reads the way I imagine people pretend to speak when they're speaking \"southern hick\" to be mockingly superior but have never actually heard a real human in the south speak.**Then I reached the part on p57 where Kya's dad says of his family:\"They had land, rich land, raised tobacco and cotton and such. Over near Asheville. Yo' gramma on my side wore bonnets big as wagon wheels and long skirts. We lived in a house wif a verandder that went a'the way around two stories high. It was fine, mighty fine.\"I actually took a screenshot and sent it to my husband who was born and lived his entire life \"near Asheville\". His response, \"What in the world?\" What in the world indeed.A. No one from western NC talks like this. And Kya's father didn't move to the OBX until he was an adult, so he would still have his home dialect. Any student of language knows you don't shed and switch an accent easily once you're in adulthood. It takes practice. And even then the results are dodgy. Also this is not how Pamlico people speak anyway. See my rant about dialect above.B. Does Owens know Asheville is in the mountains??? (Tobacco was grown in the mountains though not nearly as much or as successfully as in the Piedmont. Cotton is waaaayyy harder. It gets too cold and rains too much. Also there's just not enough flat, arable land to make it worth the effort. I know there was a cotton mill in Asheville at the time, but I've never heard about people growing the cotton around there. If they were, it had to have failed more than half the time and not because of weevils. It's just not hot enough long enough. And no one was getting rich off agriculture and building plantation style houses there with slaves as was mentioned later in the book. Western NC was not like the Deep South. Because it is MOUNTAINS. Anyone who has ever driven to Asheville from the Piedmont knows exactly how mountainous. It's like flat flat flat whoa we're going UP. There's not enough flat land for plantations.)Then there was the part where Tate's mom went to ASHEVILLE for a bike because they didn't have it at the local store. Like WHAT??? She didn't try Wilmington? She drove past Greenville, Raleigh (the capitol), Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, missed exits to CHARLOTTE (the largest city), to drive up a mountain for a bike? Literally no other city in NC had it? it takes SIX HOURS to drive from the Pamlico Sound to Asheville on a good traffic day in the year of our Lord 2019. Do you know how long it would've been in the 50s???Good Grief, what is this woman's obsession with Asheville? And does she believe it is somewhere near the coast rather than on the complete opposite end of a rather long state?Which is how I knew no matter how smart she sounded or how much she might know about science and wildlife, Delia Owens didn't bother to research squat about North Carolina. Or she did and then disregarded it for whatever reason. Maybe she thought the Outer Banks and Asheville as NC's top tourist destinations were the names she needed to drop to make her book sound authentic??? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Huge parts of the novel are a giant snooze fest of nature this nature that and here's some more nature. And also grits. Because this is SOUTHERN y'all. In case it hasn't been hammered in yet.There were some freakin' awkward sexual scenes.Then there were the long drawn out court scenes that were just so tedious.I gathered from these scenes Owens is also unclear about travel times from the Greenville to the OBX. (Also I'm not sure if there ever was a Piedmont Hotel in Greenville, which is in the coastal plain and not the Piedmont. However, there IS one in Waynesville, which is also not in the Piedmont. Waynesville is in the mountains near.....guess where....Asheville.) Someone buy the woman a freakin' map since she clearly doesn't know what Google is.The working of the town vs Kya also bothered me. It's like Owens knows that the OBX people are a difficult community to become a part of without truly understanding the whys and hows of it all.Kya's character development was just so frustrating overall. And some of the stuff she accomplishes requires a tremendous suspension of disbelief. Owens definitely wanted the reader to see her a certain way. She is a manic pixie dream girl in a marsh until suddenly she isn't...I was SO MAD about that. Because I hate when men write manic pixie dream girls. But when women do it? I'm enraged. Way to take it to your own gender. Then it turns out Kya should have a shirt that reads, NOT YOUR MANIC PIXIE DREAM GIRL in fluorescent letters. When I got to the end, I was so angry. Because the Kya we got a glimpse of those last couple of pages, WHER THE HECK WAS SHE THE ENTIRE BOOK? I want to read a book about that complicated, brilliant girl and recognize her as such through the whole thing. Ugh. Give me the Kya who can cold-bloodedly commit a well thought out murder, convince a jury she didn't, make a good portion of the community feel guilty for even suspecting her in the first place, and live a happily contented life forever after. It would have been way more interesting than what came up to that point. I FEEL SO CHEATED. And you know it's just because Owens wanted the element of surprise. But it wasn't really THAT surprising. Why wasn't I allowed to appreciate Kya for the vengeful goddess she was in planning that and executing it beautifully. Don't give me this knowledge with no insight AFTER SHE'S DEAD. Let me SEE ALL OF THAT.And finally rant-wise, Owens doesn't seem to know quite what she wants this book to be. Is it an ode to nature? Is it a crime novel? Is it literary fiction? It's kind of like she wanted to write the crime novel but genre writing is too plebeian, so here comes the overwrought language and navel gazing. Because ART. The nature part was her falling back on what she was comfortable with I think.*Crayfish do, I learned from my research, make a noise but we don't often hear it as they can make it underwater as well as out of water. It sounds like tap dancing. No singing even remotely flirted with. Where the Crawdads Tap Dance doesn't have the same ring I guess. And also doesn't narrow things down geographically. I did wonder why it wasn't called Where the Cicadas Sing. Because those sing. And are on a 17 year cycle. Which would have fit PERFECTLY with the timeline of the book. So color me confused. I know NC can be overrun with cicadas, but I'm not sure if the Pamlico region has them or not. Still would have made more sense than the actual title. (Again, it sounds flowery and important. Doesn't mean it has depth or meaning.)**My husband decided at age 13 to get rid of his accent. He worked long and hard at it. He did it by listening to network TV anchors and copying their speech patterns. It took years of concentrated effort. It's still not completely gone though he can pass for not being southern in other parts of the country. And when he's home? It comes back full force with all its dialectic eccentricities. I've lived the majority of my life in the Southern Appalachian mountains. Everyone here still knows I'm an outsider the second I open my mouth despite the fact my midwestern relatives swear up and down I have an accent now. And people here in eastern Tennessee are uncertain about my husband because he sounds kind of like them but not quite. (He's let his accent come back more since settling here because it helps with the not being considered an outsider. That's as important in southern Appalachia as it is in the OBX if you want to be embraced by the community.) But a single gorge changed the dialect between eastern TN Appalachian and western NC Appalachian just enough natives here recognize his accent as being not quite theirs. BY THE WAY my husband was just as smart after training out his accent as he was when he had it at its thickest. He knew he needed it gone to be a journalist, so he got rid of it. He was literally asked to \"speak southern\" by people in Michigan when we lived there briefly more than once so they could laugh about it. Which is f***ed up. Southerners speak the way they do for cultural and geographical reasons and it has nothing to do with the amount of intelligence or righteousness they have."

As a reader and also somebody who works in the publishing industry, I want all readers to like or love as many books as possible, so the fact that you love this book is, in my opinion, a good thing. If reading a review that does not agree with your opinion enrages you, don't read this review. I do not believe there are spoilers in my opinion, but a couple of commenters think there are. So if you have not yet read this book, you may not want to read my review. I read it quite a while ago and have moved on to many more books that I'm more interested in. So I won't be joining conversation in the comments. If you disliked this book, you may enjoy having some company in your opinion. --Betsy RobinsonThe Review (November 18, 2018)Normally I would not finish let alone review a book I disliked as much as I did this one, but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club, I've decided to say what I think:I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully split—almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case, since the author's an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya, left alone in the marsh to fend for herself, starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul—I loved, felt, and smelled the land, sea, air, and dense plants. But when people started talking, the writing became stilted, overwritten, and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad, and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids' scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned, like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version ofLaw and Order, where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example, a deputy says to his sheriff:\"I'm hungry. Let's go by the diner on the way out there.\"\"Well, get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town's pretty riled up. Chase Andrew's murder's the biggest thing's happened 'round here, maybe ever. Gossip's goin' up like smoke signals.\"\"Well, keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne'er-do-wells can't keep their mouths shut.\"(61)Why not just, \"I'm hungry,\" and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime?In real life, people do not say everything they're thinking or narrate everything that's happening or is going to happen. In fact, most of us lie about what we really think—if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts, leaving gaps in truth, and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.I found the character development absurd: Simply put, there are no authentic, complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat, which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances, one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated, sophisticated, poetry-reciting biologist, knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard, etc., and the other, a sexual relationship where she doesn't even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.I finished this book by skimming large sections, starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent, sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun, but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya's character.Sorry, friends who adore this book, I'm an outlier on this one, I guess."

        "user_review": "Seeing as to how I skipped most of the second half of the book, I have no choice but to give it one star.There are so many things wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The only thing it really had going for it was the plot, which was definitely a good one, and it is too bad that it got wrecked.I am at a loss to put this book into any kind of genre. Romance? YA? Courtroom drama? Murder mystery? I rather suspect that the author had the idea, first and foremost, to weave a story around how human behavior imitates that of wildlife, was fascinated by the marsh area of NC and fashioned a story around this. As a result the book neither flies nor swims. We might, on one page, get a lot of scientific information about insects, birds and plants, then we are back to the romance style of \"her cheeks burned,\" \"her groin throbbed as if all her blood had surged there.\" \"her long hair trailing in the wind\" and \"he reached out and ran his fingers across her firm breasts.\" Did I mention that she had black hair and red lips? And that she spontaneously recites poetry out loud on the beach?Some books have unlikely coincidences, some have downright contrived ones and others have those that are highly unlikely and therefore plain unbelievable. In the first and second cases, a book can still make it if the characterisations, settings and plot are well done. In the third case, unless you are talking about a fairy tale, you have to be either really romantically minded or you just go along with whatever for the sake of entertainment. \"Crawdads\" falls into the third category.It is rather unbelievable that, even with an abusive and alcoholic father, the rest of the family would simply abandon their six-year old daughter and sister, unless they were totally depraved, which the author portrays them as not. It is unbelievable that not one single adult in the nearby town would know that the girl was in the marsh by herself and thus make some effort to help her. I will put the rest of the \"unbelievables\" at the bottom in a spoiler alert. Aside from them, there are the errors and other annoying facets.Such as the author's use of the vernacular, but only for the bad folks. The good folks all speak proper English. Such as the author's fascination with southern food, especially grits, black-eyed peas and turnip greens, which are mentioned ad-nauseum.Spoiler alert: Unbelievable that the girl, who did not learn to read until age 14, would then go on to become a self-educated scientist and artist and even write several books, all while being entirely on her own in the wilds. It is unbelievable, since she wasn't that far from town, that she would never seek out any contact with anyone besides her two suitors and an old black couple. Especially since she was a \"looker\" and wore white cut-off jeans (really??) when she went to town to buy groceries. How could everyone be so mean to her unless she was plain weird (which we are assured she was not). No, it was that all the town's people were just narrow-minded and mean…except for of course the one golden boy with the golden locks."

        "user_review": "All the Stars!!!!!Can I just say that I loved everything about this book and leave it at that!?!Where the Crawdads Sing is a story of resiliency, survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, desperation, prejudice, determination and strength. This book goes back and forth in time to tell the story of Kya Clark a.k.a. the Marsh girl. She lives on the outskirts of town, in the Marsh, and the locals look down their noses at her, she is judged, ridiculed and bullied. But there are those who show her kindness, friendship, and show her love. Oh, how I loved this book!Kya was a young girl when her Mother walked away without looking back. Soon, all her siblings followed suit, leaving Kya alone with her often absent, drunk, and abusive father. She is left to care for their home, to cook, clean and take care of both of their needs. How her situation pulled on my heartstrings. She had to learn to shop, to cook and to provide food for herself in her father's absence. All while dealing with loneliness, feelings of abandonment and loss. Always wondering when and if her Mother will ever return. She was a smart and clever girl who knew the marsh and found ways to make money and provide for her basic needs. Soon 'Jumpin and his wife, Mable, show her kindness, generosity and love. I dare you not to adore this couple!As Kya grows and learns more about life through her interactions with the creatures of the Marsh, two young men enter her life. One is her brother's older friend, Tate, who teaches her to read and shows her acceptance and happiness. Another brings her hope of a future but won't introduce her to his friends and family. Could one be her chance at happiness? A chance at belonging? A chance at being accepted? A chance at being loved? A Chance for growth? Or will history repeat itself?In 1969, local football legend, Chase Andrews is found dead. Rumors swirl as to motive and possible suspects. Rumors have been circulating for years about Chase and his involvement with the Marsh girl. Could she be his killer? What motive could she have?This book had a little bit of everything that I love: a likeable main character who pulls at your heartstrings, murder mystery, atmosphere, drama, coming of age, and romance. There are several characters who give and show kindness including, Tate, the cashier who gives back too much change and the couple who make sure Kya has what she needs. What is the saying? Those that have the least to give, give the most! There is a police investigation and court room drama and some twists and turns I did not see coming.This book is beautifully written and contains poetry and vivid descriptions of the Marsh. I highly recommend this book! It's thoughtful, evokes emotion, and transports the reader back in time to the Marsh. I loved every page.Read more of my reviews atwww.openbookpost.com"

        "user_review": "*5 Stars,easily!*WHERE THE CRAWDADS SINGis a gentle yetsymbolicdepiction of the valiant survival ofKya Clark—a reclusive young girl who has been abandoned by her parents, siblings, school system, the entire town surrounding her, and what ultimately feels like life itself.Mother Naturehas quite literally becomeKya'scaretaker, and deep in a lonely Marsh along the North Carolina coast is where Kya will not only hide, but blossom into a primal independent being, coaxed inside the embrace of an indiscriminate wilderness as she embodies its uninhibited spirit.Until a boy from \"yonder\" befriends Kya, and her lonely existence is shaken straight to its solemn core. Add to that the curious unsolved murder of the town's local \"Golden Boy\", and all that's left to say is game-on.Although this story delivers one hell of a powerful punch, it is sculpted with a humble hand; a delicate wind that keeps building and building until it ends up emphatically blowing your mind.The writing. Is. Beautiful. Prose so unique and so breathtaking that a single description of afireflysuddenly grows so intimate and probing, and I might have gotten something in my eye—*sniff*.Here you'll find sentences that read like poetry, with a lyrical rhythm that sways the reader like the gentle rocking of a boat. Yet it is not showy nor over-the-top --- but prettyperfect.Owensdoesn't tell us what to think, but alludes to each message through writing so alive you can almost hear it breathing. She carries us through her dense, atmospheric tone and persuades us to seek and find; discover and examine, all on our own.She allows her striking imagery to guide us as the marsh has guided Kya, and I felt as though I could smell the sea and taste the sweetness of new love.Kya's journey spans years, the reader present from her childhood into maturity. I love this story's ode to wilderness and Mother Earth with her instinctual need to nurture and protect. I love each character's flawed nature as well as those redeemed. I love the heart and soul that saturates every inch of this story, and more than anything, ILOVEthat spectacularly bold ending!To the reader who appreciates nature's effortless beauty honored in fiction; to those who seek a love story every bit true as it is tender; to the one who needs a tantalizing murder/mystery to spice things up, and for those who tend to root for the underdog in hopes she'll someday sparkle like the gem she is—this one's foryou.*Traveling Friends Read*"

        "user_review": "Phew, I finally made it through this book! My apologies to everyone who loved this, but unfortunately, I did not, and no one's sadder than me.ReadingWhere the Crawdads Singwas like stepping back in time to high school, when class-assigned books meant lots of award-winning fiction. Sure, there were plenty of literary merit found in these pages, but little joy was actually experienced from reading them.Starting at the age of six, Kya was slowly abandoned by everyone in her family, until she was the sole person left living in a little shack at the edge of town. As the years went by, shunned by the entire town, she slowly became known as the \"Marsh Girl,\" a wild and lonely creature that few knew and most feared. This is her story. And when the town's golden boy dies, old prejudices flair up, and Kya finds herself at the receiving end of the town's anger and suspicion.This story is descriptive prose at its most verbose, and no detail—the marsh, waterways, bugs, trees, animals, and sea shells—was too small to be included. But the story has little plot and even less character development. Especially in the beginning, when Kya didn't talk to or interact with a single person, the monotony of the writing almost did me in.The other big issue is that the story is pretty hard to believe. We're supposed to accept that Kya is able to fend for herself, which includes cooking, cleaning, going to the store, buying things, and coming up with ways to make money, all at the age of six. That is way beyond the realm of possibility, let alone probability. There's only so far my beliefs can be suspended, I tell you.That's not to say I didn't enjoy a single thing here because I did. I found the middle of the book to be the most engaging. That was when Kya started interacting with others and the writing became a little bit more interesting as a result. Tate and Jumpin' were my favorite characters, and every scene they were in grabbed me. But the juxtaposition of their scenes (alive and compelling) against the ones without them (descriptive and unchanging) made the latter feel even more dull and plodding by comparison.In the end, this book just isn't for me. Everything that others loved are all the same things I didn't. I prefer my books to have interesting plot advancement, nuanced character growth, and zippy writing, none of which this book had. Instead, the plot is straightforward, the characters all remain stubbornly the same throughout, and the writing is long-winded enough to deflate even the most enthusiastic of readers."

        "user_review": "All of you talked me into reading this book. The Goodreads reviews were virtually unanimously good, not just good, great. It had to be good, I thought. And because I needed an extra audiobook I bought it on Libro.fm and locked myself into reading it. Bad decision.This book is just a pile of tropes and cliches dressed up in some nice nature writing. The plot is not much of a plot and the mystery makes up only a small section of the book, and much of it ends up being courtroom scenes and not much mystery. This book is basically Manic Pixie Dream Girl In the Marsh. We spend a long time with young Kya, abandoned, fending for herself, almost entirely isolated. I was willing to be patient through all that, to see what kind of person she would grow into because that had the potential to be very interesting.Except it was not. It became less interesting the longer I read. Because Kya doesn't act like a person who has been almost entirely isolated. She just acts like a regular loner. Sure, she may have some habits that fit with her strange upbringing, but she seems to understand people and language just like a regular person. I was nearly out of my head with frustration that the book had spent so long telling me how different she was only to have her be just the same as most people. (Deciding to never love again because everyone leaves you is a pretty regular-person thing to do when you're in your 20's, for example.)This isn't a book of deep psychological insight. You can probably guess from a couple of chapters in how it will end. (And you would be right!) There are no real revelations, the plot is pretty obvious ahead of time. And it's all rather confusing because there are sections where Owens writes well, her courtroom scenes are actually quite competent, but on both the broad strokes and the specific details nothing here really rings true. And the more time that passed the more I got annoyed with this book so it finally fell from 3-stars to a rare 2-star review. (I usually quit a 2-star book.) If you're going to give me a plot I've seen a thousand times, at least wrap it in some keen insight or character development. But sadly this was a failure for me all around."

        "user_review": "I seem to be finding myself in the minority a lot these days. The first half of this book was pretty close to marvelous, and then it went south on me (that is a pun). Anyway, after my attempt at weak humor, let me resume in a serious note to say I was expecting so much more than I got here.Kya is a mere ten years old in 1952 when she is deserted, albeit gradually, by all the members of her family and left to make it alone in the marsh country of North Carolina. She forms a real attachment and understanding of her environment, which would be a necessity to survive in such a place, and she mostly works that to her advantage. When a young man who was once a friend of her brother finds her alone and begins to offer some help and company, she learns to read and her life begins to take a turn toward something more than isolation and running barefoot through the woods.That part of the story was interesting to me. I was interested in how she would survive, whether she would connect with the outside world, and of course how she would tie into the parallel story of the 1969 murder of a young man from the neighboring town. Then, in what seemed an abrupt change of tone, the story devolved into what I would deem chick lit. The plot became shallow and the author seemed to me to have lost the thread of her story and veered into another realm.I am sorry this didn't work for me. I wanted it to, indeed I thought it was going to. Perhaps it is me. Since it is a group read, I am anxious to see what the other members of the group saw that perhaps I did not.I had originally rated this a 3-star read, but after reflection I find that I strongly feel it was only \"OK\" and therefore I have revised the rating to 2-stars. I think I felt shy of giving it only 2 when so many of my respected friends had given it 5...but truth should prevail."

I was highly anticipating this book after reading all the praise from readers whose tastes usually align with my own. Unfortunately, I should have DNF'd this one when very early in the book, my eyes glazed over and I began skimming pages and pages of descriptive writing. The author is a nature writer and those sections were undoubtably well-written. But I don't care for overly descriptive writing. And then there's poetry. I skipped over those as well.Everything other reviewers say they enjoyed were things I intensely disliked. I struggled with believability. I won't list them all, but the implausibility of every single plot point was something I couldn't get past.To make things worse, romance is not a genre I enjoy and the romance in this book had a very YA feel to it.Finally, I found the use of dialect distracting to read and often in the same paragraph a character would switch from local dialect to proper English.Sometimes my love of the story or the strength of the writing is enough for me to ignore implausibility and move past a few things I don't like. This wasn't one of those times.Recommended for readers who enjoy long, descriptive nature writing, and those who have no trouble suspending disbelief. If I had known these things before starting this book I would have skipped it, so perhaps my review will help other readers like me.* Thanks to Edelweiss for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review"

I do realise with those numbers it is definitely me. I read all of Part 1 and the first chapter of Part 2, then I gave up at page 156. Nothing seemed to be happening other than Kya fishing and cooking grits. There are lots of pretty nature metaphors like:Waves slammed one another, awash in their own white saliva, breaking apart on the shore with loud booms— energy searching for a beachhead. Then they flattened into quiet tongues of foam, waiting for the next surge.But I just don't enjoy descriptions of trees, swamps and bugs that much.It's funny.

I can see now why this book is getting so much attention, and am thrilled to see that for once the hype train was right on track."

        "user_review": "4.5 stars rounded up .A story of survival, of what the depth of loneliness feels like when a young girl is abandoned first by her mother, then her four siblings. Even at five Kya understands why they left - because of her father, because of his meanness, his abuse, his drinking. What she doesn't understand is why they left her behind and neither could I. She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn't come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gulls not wanting them to fly away and leave her too. Heartbreaking how she is neglected and abandoned, remembering the beatings, trying to figure out a way to eat.Atmospheric is an understatement, and I don't use that word often because it seems overused sometimes but this place, the marsh permeates just about everything that is meaningful in this story beginning with Kya's realization \"And the marsh became her mother.\" The marsh becomes her life, her livelihood, the essence of who she becomes through her self learned expertise of the insects and the birds, her art. But is it enough to heal her? The kind hearts of Jumpin' and Mabel who help a little girl alone and in need, the only human contact she has until her brother's friend Tate comes into her life, but is that enough to help her heal ? I love the writing, fabulous descriptions of the marsh. The marsh and its inhabitants, the insects, the fish, the birds which pique Kya's curiosity, give her so much joy and company, and allow her to become the expert she does become on the marsh and marsh life. But is that enough to make Kya whole after so much hurt and loneliness?There's a murder mystery, not my usual fare, but I was totally engaged, trying to come up with who the murderer was, totally engaged in the courtroom scenes. I gave it 4.5 stars because there were a couple of things that felt not quite realistic. But when I woke up thinking about this story, I knew I would round it up to 5 stars . I don't often cry over books, but this one definitely brought me to tears at a number of places. Overall it was such a fabulous read, heartbreaking in so many ways, with wonderful writing and characters, a stunning portrait of a place, of the trauma of loss and loneliness. My heart was always broken for Kya, a character to remember. An unforgettable ending.This was a monthly read with Esil and Diane and as always I appreciate their thoughts as we read together. In this case, we have very similar feelings about this beautiful story.I received an advanced copy of this book from G.P. Putnam's Sons through Edelweiss."

        "user_review": "Check out the most unique video review of this book!https://youtu.be/fKemigtrvvsThis book centers on a young girl named Kya who lives alone in the North Carolina marsh. The author who is well versed in non-fiction and has a strong background in nature has beautiful prose and really captures the essence of nature in her writing. Over the course of her life, Kya forms certain connections particularly with two young men from town.When Chase Andrews, a young man from town, is found dead, Kya is a suspect. Did she do it? What happened?This book goes into so many different topics: class, how you can really \"help\" someone, judging someone else, what real love is, what family is, the beauty of relationships and connection.In many ways, this book is relatable. Most people have felt like an outsider at some point in their lives. In this book, Kya was very lucky to find some people who actually cared about her. Also, the author talks about this fear that Kya felt. This is normal. Women are normally afraid unfortunately. Always looking over our shoulder. Always told to not go out at night. Always travel with someone. If anything, I think this book is a good reminder that some things haven't changed in 50 years. Women are still beat by men, and even if they do go through the law, it does not always work out. This book.....Wow! It definitely deserved all of the buzz. That being said, I did NOT like the last 2 pages of the book. I thought that the ending should have been more open.2024 Reading ScheduleJan\tMiddlemarchFeb\tThe Grapes of WrathMar\tOliver TwistApr\tMadame BovaryMay\tA Clockwork OrangeJun\tPossessionJul\tThe Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug\tCrime and PunishmentSep\tHeart of DarknessOct\tMoby-DickNov\tFar From the Madding CrowdDec\tA Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

The character development, so-called, is frankly unbelievable and downright ridiculous. I'm giving it an extra star because in the age of Trump I'm trying to be kinder in general.No. Just no."

        "user_review": "Among my Goodread friends, I sit in the camp of believing this was a superb book and a very easy 5 stars for me. Why? because this was a wonderful tale that had everything; from the imagery, sentiment, character appeal, and themes that were interwoven into a story so perfectly that nothing appeared overworked but all of it caught me in 'the feelers'. But most of all it had a child's / woman's determination at the centre of the story. My heart was invested.Is it a stunning piece of literature, well no it is not? Is the writing style to everyone's taste, well no to that as well? I can empathise with readers who could not connect with the dialogue particularly at the beginning. I could not get my tongue around some of the slang in the opening chapters but then it softens as the book progresses. Was it plausible for a young girl to live in the marshes – perhaps no to that as well?However, could I connect with a story of hardship, isolation, courage, endurance, and overcoming prejudices, then yes, I could. I love the stories of drive, strength, accomplishment and determination, despite the odds, and this book has it in abundance. A beautiful story told with so much heart.The PlotKya is a Marsh girl, deserted by her mother and left to a drunk and violent father, who eventually abandons her along with all her other siblings. She was not school educated, and so she begins to learn her lessons in life through nature, the wildness surrounding her and with a little help from her friend Tate. Possessing an irrepressibly curious mind Kya finds a dizzying array of new ways to live and learn through nature, she learns to love and cope with disappointment. She learns trade, life skills, and even to read and write but above all she learns to depend only on herself.What is beautiful about this story is the journey of Kya into adulthood as she learns to trust only to be disappointed, but the coming of age was handled with such delicacy and sensitivity that I can only applaud the author.I loved that Kya was not someone who would indulge in the softer emotions of self-pity and disappointment but accepted her earlier demise and went about changing it. At the end of the book we see the poor 'marsh girl' replaced with something wonderfully unique but still true to her inner values. A girl who did not need to wear fancy dresses and depend on social acceptance to define her - because it was the torn clothes, years of rejection, isolation, and abuse that she would go on to wear as badges of courage and of survival.The sensory descriptions, the beautifully described landscape, the character development through the book and the storyline made this a 5-star read for me.The simplicity of this story was its beauty, Kay's isolation and growth was its crowning glory and so the Crawdad's Sing!!!!"

        "user_review": "At the time of reading, this book seems to be the most hyped book in my Goodreads feed. Not a minute goes by without a review or update from this book popping up. If you know me, you know that no matter the type of book or the subject matter, if it is hyped I want to give it a go. With that in mind, when I started this, the only thing I knew about it was its hype – I knew zero about the story, genre, type of book, etc. I just had a cover and a title!Did it live up to the hype?I think it did. I was entertained by the story and found it very easy to follow. It was a bit of historical fiction with some mystery involved eventually rounding off with a little courtroom drama. One of my favorite phrases to use when applicable is that \"heart-strings were pulled\", and there was definitely some of that happening here. I think if you like a good, well-told story you will like this one.Who do I recommend it to?Historical fiction fans for sure. Especially those interested in mid-20th Century American fiction. Issues of race and public perception at that time are key to the plot.I am not sure there was enough mystery/courtroom drama to interest fans of those genres if that is specifically what you are looking for. But, there is enough if you just need to satiate a small hunger.Also, while only a little steamy at times, I think fans of stories with some romance will enjoy this one. Again, if you need a lot of hot a heavy in your romance, you will not find it here, but the relationships in the story should be of interest.Should you read it?I feel like this story has a little of a bunch of genres and not too much of any. Because of this, I think it will appeal to a wide audience. So, if you have seen the hype in your feed, too, and have been wondering, I think you should try it out. You may not be blown away, but I don't think you will be disappointed."

The townspeople abhorred her and left her well-alone.But when you are only a child yourself,how do you survive?Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.And so Kya learns to love and live by herself.Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.And as she grew,so did her curiosity.She could read anything now, he said, and once you can read anything you can learn everything. It was up to her.Since she could read and write, and she had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, she did the only logical thing -she taught herself.I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.But then, Chase Andrews, winds up dead. Kya Clark, now an adult, is the prime suspect.Just when her life was finally picking up,it goes to pieces.Whew. Guys. Girls. People of all ages.This one wasSTUNNING. Like absolutely *stunning*.I don't even know where to begin - there was so much to love about this book.The setting was absolutely magical - every time we talked about the swamp and the life within it, I was absolutely riveted to the book.Kya was sucha gorgeous main character- I felt for her so much and I wanted to just wrap her up in a hug the whole time.Kya's first love was so beautifully done - I literally had the hug-the-book-to-yourself-and-squeal moment when they found each other.I also have now developed an addition to nature-themed books thanks to this gorgeous one.In short - there's aLOTto love about this book and youNEEDto read it as soon as possible.This one was absolutely stunning.

        "user_review": "This starts out as a wonderful book well worth a five-start rating. The voice of the coming of age Kya is truly amazing. Had the craft been sustained through to the end of the book this could have easily been compared to, To Kill a Mocking Bird.The setting is marvelous and carries the same weight as a main character. Absolutely wonderful descriptions.The author does a magnificent job creating the character of Kya, with details that make her come alive on the page. This book would have worked fine just as a coming of age novel minus the mystery of the murder.The insertion of the secondary plotline is disruptive and breaks the flow of the story. Part of the problem is the dramatic shift in voice from Kya to the sheriff. Kya is handled masterfully, the sheriff, not so much. These disruptive scenes are kept short but they are still speed bumps that urged me to put the book down.The author is a wonderful craftsman. At about page 150 the author wanted to emphasize one part of a scene and shifted from past tense to present tense just for a few paragraphs. The transition and its impact were wonderful, and done so well it was practically invisible.The story is character driven which is my favorite kind of book, however when handling the mystery part of the story, the protagonist doesn't dig up the clue. Two different witnesses at two different times, and long after the crime has occurred, comes forward and says, \"Oh, I might have seen something that night. I just didn't think it was important.\" For me this too is a minor distraction but it could have easily been avoided.The character voice matures as the character gets older and is real and believable. This is difficult to do and the way it is done here is truly an art form.I all but put the book down three quarters of the way through when the murder case was described. I just couldn't buy it. The quick alternating scenes in that last quarter of the book, the jail and court scenes too often disrupted the fictive dream and tossed me out of the story. There is a definite tone change that comes from a shift in the craft. The voice is lost with the shifting from character to character, too many points of view. And the use of cliché's like \"I walked into a door,\" and \"I jus' didn't fall off a turnip truck.\" didn't match the wonderful craft in the first three quarters of the book. It almost feels as if the ending had not been planned, or more likely was rushed.The ending was predictable because of the way the protagonist pov was handled (or avoided), and that there really wasn't any other possibility, no red herrings to choose from so it left only one possible outcome. There wasn't twist at the end. I wasn't surprised at all. So reluctantly I have to give this one four stars instead of a five plus.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series"

        "user_review": "MEMORABLE CHARACTERS AND MEMORABLE STORY. For me to rate a book five stars it has to give me something bout of the ordinary, make me feel. Most of all it has to be a book or contain a character or characters that I won't forget. Above all it has to make me feel. This book did all three. Kya, aka Catherine Clark, the Marsh girl is an unforgettable character, abandoned by her mother at she six, her siblings shortly after. By ten she was alone in the Marsh raising herself, her main source of comfort the natural life found in the North Carolina Marsh, the gulls she fed daily. She learned not to trust nor depend on anyone but herself. She was smart, curious, feArless and so lonely. As if this character wasn't enough to remember, there are also some supporting characters that play an integral part in her life. Jumpin and Mabel, a black couple that try to help Kya in whatever way she will accept. Tate, who has known her since she was small, teaches her to read anc much more.What will one do in the face of such loneliness? How much will they sacrifice if they reach out, trust? Prejudice is a big theme, because as the Marsh girl she is considered illiterate, unclean, and none in the village reach out to help. There is of course a villian, who claims to love her, but marries another, breaking her heart . This is there another thread comes in, a story told in alternate chapters, as when he is murdered , she is accused. Also where another wonderful character comes in, a man, 74 years old, a retired lawyer who comes out of retirement to defend her against a town that already assumes she is guilty.I could nitpick a few things, but I won't. I loved and learned much about the natural world, a different way of looking at things. On walks I take along the river I will look at things I ordinarily wouldn't. A survival story, what Kya has to do it not easy, but since she has little choice it is what she does. Making the most of what one has, regardless of how little. More than one I had tears running down my face, so this gets five, big marshmallow stars from this reader.This was mine, Angela and Esils August read, and as always our reads and discussions are something in which I look forward.ARC from Edelweiss."

How can your heart not help but ache for Kya? First her mother leaves, then her siblings, even her ne'er do well father. Left to her own devices by the entire town, she survives without schooling or any aid. The preacher's wife calls her white trash and hurries her child away from Kya convinced she carries disease.The marsh is a character in its own right. Owens does a magnificent job describing it so that we feel we are there, seeing every plant, bird and insect along with Kya. Owens paints the surroundings just like Kya paints, with a fine brush intent on getting every detail right.There are so many heartbreaking moments in this book. Kya just can't understand why everyone leaves her. The murder mystery was very well done and I had no clue how it would play out. The suspense was killing me.So, this is my first five star book of 2019. It has everything - beautiful writing, great characters and suspense. Highly recommend it!"

She's a one-of-a-kind-author!!!This book could easily become a modern classic!The prose is so outstanding — gorgeous—that the smells and visuals of the wildlife — made me feel as if I was there too.— a world with no walls—birds, nests, water, shells, mussels, grasses, trees, —— the *marshlands* - becomes a living character in this story.Listening to this novelwhile being outside —surrounded by plants -birds - squirrels- trees- and water myself- added reminders of respect for the world around us....which those who spend time alone in nature know what I'm talking about: quiet transformative thoughts arise with the beauty of the ecosystems.Our human energy is tantalizingly free in ways it never is when indoors behind our computers and other technical devices.The Audiobook narrator -Cassandra Campbell, completely transported me to this world.The voice of Kya was PERFECT!!!! She used many different inflections for each character.I wanted to know Tate Walker and Jumper...but it's Kya Clark, who dominant my heart and thoughts. She was not only abandoned by her family - but so many in her town rejected her.Abandonment as a child - hours upon hours of a solitary life ... playing in creeks, climbing trees, mudboarding the surface of the beach waters, digging for crabs, no parents around - is a memory which comes back to me from my own childhood....wandering outdoors...Kya Clark is tenacious- brave - resilient- an indomitable heroine....but has flaws too...which made me like her more.The circumstances of her unfortunate family inheritance is heartbreaking enough...but to suspect her of a crime... of murder? - it was almost hard to suspend belief.And so ugly to have a reputation as 'swamp trash'.And how is it possible - and why - for heavens sake would a little girl kill an older bigger football player, Andrew Chase?There is suspense in this novel that I didn't expect or know anything about when I started reading this. I had no idea I was about to read about a murder mystery...not that it's the prime focus.. but... so much about thisbook with 'mostly' positive reviews....were surprises to me.Set in the 50's and 60's....alternating timelines.....around the North Carolina Coast marshlands ....The 60's is the story of Andrew Chase - his body found dead: who killed him?...and a courtroom case...The 50's is completely Kya's story - from when her mother left - [The Dominate Story].....*Kya Clark*!!It's Kya we can't stop thinking about!!!Kya couldn't read or write - but there is an inspiring coming of age story in here with a few Guardian Angels - so to speak who are 'for' Kya.We witness Kya out-shine her neglectful youth. Really emotionally moving!!!Mystery murder - suspense - coming of age - occasional cuisine meals to remember-Nature at its best...Gulls as friends...Loneliness...heartbreaking sadness -Human connections...&Trust issues...A little romance...Completely captivating: story & prose!!!!*Delia Owens* will soon be a household name to readers.What in the world will she write next?"

        "user_review": "Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is a 2018 G.P. Putnam's Sons publication.One part mystery, one part legal drama, one part coming of age story, and one part love story- equals a full heartrending poignant tale that will leave you gasping for air.Barkley Cove, North Carolina- 1969Kya Clark- aka- \"The Marsh Girl' has been abandoned, one by one, by every single person in her life. She lives by the seat of her pants, in a shack, eluding everyone, except a friend of her brother's named, Tate.Tate watches out for Kya, when he's able, and teaches her to read, among other things. As time moves on, however, despite a deepening affection for Kya, Tate knows he'll have to leave, and go away to college.While he's away, the myth of 'The Marsh Girl' will solidify forevermore. Kya will face a challenge like no other, and her fate will rest in the hands of the residents of Barkley Cove, with folks who have taunted her, shunned her, and judged her, her entire life.In 2016-17, there were several stellar novels written, which centered around children or teens raised in a turbulent, 'off the grid' environment, living in harsh conditions and under the care of an unreliable, or unstable father. While they were all quite compelling and effective, I wasn't sure I wanted to tackle another one with a similar theme.Yet, with more and more high praise pouring in and one stellar review after another posted by readers, I began to regret my decision to pass on this one. So, obviously, I succumbed, and checked it out of the library.I never doubted the book would be a good one, I just didn't know if I had the emotional strength right at this moment to tackle the topics of abuse and neglect.But as it turns out, this story isn't really about the escape from an unconventional upbringing, or about the harsh survivalist or endurance skills needed to cope with an unforgiving landscape, as I had originally thought.While the story certainly drives home the cause and effects of abandonment and the cycles of domestic abuse and violence, this is also a very tender coming of age tale, a story of survival, but also a story of real friendship, true love, and what it means to truly feel free.Kya suffers a great deal of heartbreak, even from unexpected sources, but seems to have resigned herself to a way of life she believes is really her only true option. But, all of it is threatened when a body is found in the marsh, and Kya's life is suddenly under a white-hot spotlight.The author does a fantastic job with the ecological descriptions and drawing the reader into the beauty Kya sees in her environment. The rich characterizations, especially with Kya's character study, is another area in which the book excels.There are layers of thought -provoking topics, and a stunning revelation that knocked my breath out, but for those who are sticklers for realistic fiction, this one stretches the boundaries of plausibility in many places. However, you should allow yourself to go along with it, because that is part of the beauty of fiction, and it is well worth any required suspension of belief.Ultimately, I was exceedingly glad I gave this book a try. It was everything I knew it would be, but it was a lot more than I anticipated. As a fan of courtroom drama, I enjoyed the trial scenes, and the mystery elements, but of course it is Kya who stole my heart and made me feel envious for to the kind of freedom and way of life she willingly sacrificed so much to maintain.4 stars"

If so, do you critique every book you read with that same expectation? It would be a pity if you did.Like movies, I don't expect every one I watch to be an Academy Award winner. If I did, that would certainly narrow the number of films I'd see. No, I go to be entertained (whatever that may mean on any particular day). That's the way I look at the books I read, particularly fiction, and I think Dan Brown's books are very entertaining. They are afictionalescape.We've all seen the stats that show how few books Americans are reading these days (present company excluded) and I think these types of books are an excellent way to get the masses to pick up, read, listen and get back involved in books. That's what it is all about…like starting children with books from an early age, once they're in, who knows where it can lead them. I want more of my friends to read books and if this is the hook, then I'm happy to bait it and reel them in.My personal opinion of the LostKeySymbol was that I liked it, but after reading all his other books I found this one more predictable. Still it was entertaining and I recommend it. I think many others will enjoy it as well."

He's a name-brand & url spewing, Wikipedia-like fountain of knowledge, who CAN'T HANDLE VERB TENSES. He also likes really short sentences. That aren't sentences at all. Really. Expect iPhone, Twitter, and Google shout-outs, too. I'm almost surprised he didn't mention the inevitable hash #thelostsymbol and tell us to use it when we tweet about what we just learned.On the flip side, who doesn't love a good romp around a famous city solving mysteries with art and science and religion? You know the drill, and the formula hasn't changed here in the slightest.As a former DC resident of 7 years, I have to admit, I was expecting slightly more from the location, but Langdon and his companion du jour keep getting trapped in random places, so it's a bit disappointing on that front. He does get 10 points for a hilarious caper including the Blue Line out to the King Street station though and the Red Line to Tenleytown (yeah, Tenleytown shout-out, what up!)This book's wacky science theme is Noetics, and the quasi-religious thing at hand is the Masons. Since the first thing that comes to mind re: Noetics is Fringe, I sort of expected a Pacey Witter guest appearance, but alas, it was not meant to be. I know absolutely zip about the Masons, but who wants to bet their membership applications go through the roof this month?So my final verdict: did I hate it as much as Catcher in the Rye? No. (Will I ever hate any book as much as I hate Catcher in the Rye? Unlikely. BUT THERE'S TIME.) Is it the best Robert Langdon book? Not by a long shot. Angels & Demons still is the best of the trilogy. Is it still vaguely enjoyable in the way only a Dan Brown book can be? Yes. Does Dan Brown's copy editor need to be publicly humiliated? YES AND HIS NAME IS APPARENTLY JASON KAUFMAN (according to the Acknowledgements, so I'm not like, stalking anyone here) AND GOOD LORD MAN, ONLY YOU CANPREVENT FOREST FIRES CAUSED BY PEOPLE BURNING THIS BOOKEDIT THIS INTO SOMETHING ENJOYABLE. EVERY TIME DAN BROWN DOESN'T KNOW HOW A VERB WORKS, KITTENS DIE.Also, if I ever have to read the words \"neutered sex organ\" again, I will be forced to remove my eyeballs and then pour bleach directly onto my brain.One more P.S., since I tweeted this and then forgot to include this here: Most unbelievable part of the plot? The Redskins are in the playoffs AND score on their opening possession. PLEASE TRY AGAIN, YOU FAIL AT HAVING SPORTS KNOWLEDGE."

        "user_review": "I liked Angels and Demons and I really liked The DaVinci Code but this latest of Dan Browns thrillers was barely worth the time, and definitely not worth the money.The Lost Symbol follows the familiar Dan Brown formula - an ominous conspiracy, a threat to end the world as we know it, a relentless villain, and a search for hidden secrets which require the decoding of obscure clues. This formula has given us a couple of fine thrillers, and has taken advantage of the authors familiarity with arcane history, philology, symbolism, art and architecture. But even this intriguing texture would not be terribly interesting without the intrepid symbologist Robert Langdon to lead us through the perilous labyrinth at high speed. This time, Langdon must find the Freemason's grand secret hidden in Washington, D.C. and evade both the CIA and a brilliant but scary villain, while rescuing a kidnapped friend and his sister.The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons were both intriguing and thrilling enough to overcome Mr. Brown's weak writing. But because The Lost Symbol's plot is so much weaker, Brown's sophomoric writing becomes much more obvious and ever more bothersome as the work progresses. For example, the formulaic mini-cliffhangers at the end of nearly every chapter became trite and annoying manipulations. Brown also employed several set-pieces of lecture and discovery that annoyingly repeat themselves. This book is full of Brownian cliches.I think that the credibility of this work is further undermined by using characters who are simultaneously brilliant and clueless. For instance, the intrepid and brilliant professor Langdon, who by now should be rather wary of mysterious invitations, flies to Washington D.C. at a moment's notice supposedly at a friend's request but without actually speaking to his friend. And even less credible, is that without direct confirmation, he brings with him a top-secret package that he swore to keep hidden at all costs.Similarly, the brilliant scientist Katherine doesn't think to back up her life's work of scientific research, and she allows a man she's met only once into her \"top secret\" laboratory because she receives a TEXT message purportedly from her brother who she admits doesn't even know how to text. And these are not the only naive, and clueless people who should know better. The police and security guards are all hapless,and even the CIA director fails to question whether a suspect is lying when he says \"I'll be there in 20 minutes.\"More disappointing still is that the main character of Robert Langdon seems to have been dumbed down in this book. He repeatedly is adamant about thus and such only to be subsequently shocked when the true meaning is revealed. He always requires two attempts to decipher the true meaning of clues - the first one which is obvious and turns out to be wrong, followed by the shocking epiphany. One would think that a Harvard professor would eventually learn that things are not always what they seem. In this work Robert Langdon spends more time being lectured than he does solving mysteries or puzzles. My recollection is that he figured out absolutely nothing critical in the last third of the book.Even more troubling than Brown's weak and cliched characterization is that as the thriller reaches its climax, it becomes clear that the pieces do not fit together well. For instance, for most of the story, both the villain, and the CIA insist the stakes couldn't be higher, but in the end we learn that the potential danger is merely some bad public relations for a few powerful Masons. Why then is the CIA involved in this extortion plot - especially since it is legally barred from domestic law enforcement? The author simply fails to provide justification for all the black opps of the CIA counter- conspiracy despite their central role in the story.There are lots of problems with this book, but perhaps the its greatest flaw is Dan Brown's failure to ever explain the main premise for the book, something he calls the Ancient Mysteries. The primary force that propels the plot is the implicit promise that in the end, a tangible secret will be uncovered. While the protagonist keeps asking if this grand secret is merely metaphorical, he is assured by friends, enemies and even the CIA that the secret is literal and potentially dangerous. But, in the end we learn that the grand secret for which people are willing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes doesn't really exist. What exactly is the point of the pyramid and the secret codes and symbols if the grand mystery is already found in every church, in nearly every home, and in even in all the hotel rooms in the country? Doesn't that make the entire plot pointless to begin with?OK, if it's not clear yet, HERE IS THE BIG SPOILER: The great Masonic secret is the most widely published and read book in history - it is the Bible. Brown's thesis is that the Bible is loaded with hidden wisdom, and once these biblical secrets are pointed out, people are going to be shocked that they didn't see them before. And then they are going to be transformed because they now know that they're one with God, or they're the same as God, or they are made of God, or some such new age mumbo-jumbo. So in the end the whole purpose of all the elaborate secrecy is that a few people think mankind may not be ready for a new age when human potential will be finally unleashed. So for centuries the inner circle of Masons have concocted elaborate means to hide this enlightenment from a world not ready for apotheosis. And so despite all the symbols and codes, the grand secret is really kept hidden in plain sight. So pay no attention to the coded mysteries behind the curtain.The ending of this story is an embarrassment. It may be the most anti-climactic, unsatisfying ending I have ever read. While the story kept claiming that earth shattering secrets were soon to be revealed, in the end all the paintings, pyramids, talismans, and other clues turned out to lead to nothing. They resolved nothing, they didn't even leave us with a mystery yet unsolved. The mystery was solved, and it was an inconsequential whimper instead of a revelatory bang. It is my opinion that the author could not pull together the novel in the last chapters simply because there was nothing to pull together. There was no sweeping statement to be made and no grand secret to be revealed. This left me very unsatisfied at the story's end.Theological addendum:Many Christians are offended by the idea of apotheosis which seems to be a core premise of Brown's Masonic heroes. Though the idea of human deification has a long and ancient history in Christian thought, these critics have disowned the notion that Man can become like God, and consequently are offended when Brown places this mystery at the apex of his new-age amalgam of Masonry, religion and pseudo-science.As a Latter-day Saint (Mormon), I believe that having been literally created in God's image, we each have the innate potential to become glorified and exalted through obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My belief that man can become like god, is akin to the belief of Christian writers through the ages from Irenaus to C.S. Lewis. So deification doesn't offend me at all. Ironically, however, I find myself in strong agreement with Christian critics who accuse Brown of idolatry for claiming that this apotheosis can occur merely through our own mystical consciousness raising efforts.The central message of the Bible, and most especially the New Testament is that such a dramatic transformation can only occur on God's terms and by means of his power and grace. In contrast, Brown attempts to \"spiritualize\" or metaphorize all particularity and literal meaning out of the biblical text. To Brown's heroes, the real meaning of the text is whatever the true mystic wants to find hidden within. His new-age hodge podge of religion is very convenient,non-demanding, self-asserting and self-serving. It is the opposite of God's revealed truth which requires self-less obedience and devotion to God and our fellow men. The Bible's central message of obedience and faith is not found in Brown's mystical amalgam, nor in any other brand of humanism.Brown ironically attempts to bolster his view of an impersonal God and a godless salvation by selectively quoting the Bible, a book which persistently and powerfully testifies of a personal God - a Father in Heaven who knows us individually, and cares about helping us overcome our sins more than developing our mental, or psycho-kinetic capacities. I agree with those critics who claim that the God described, or implied by Brown is an idolatrous invention of man as surely as that of Odin, Zeus, Baal, or the God of the Greek philosophers whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.In my view, Brown's mishmash of new age nonsense intending to avoid dogma and doctrine, has very little point except to highlight that humans have enormous untapped potential. I don't see anything revealing or revolutionary about this truism. I cannot conceive of such a benign observation creating any paradigm shift, nor can I imagine it unleashing pent-up human capacity. On the contrary, I think it is mankind's persistent attempts to ignore the substantive teachings of the Bible that have bound us to telestial mediocrity.Even so, I suspect this theological critique is probably a bit over-the-top when you consider that this book is just a work of adventure fantasy. The Lost Symbol ought not to be taken too seriously. I don't imagine that it will shape many people's views of God, the Bible, or even religion in general. I don't see The Lost symbol as much of a threat to my sacred beliefs, even though I thought I might as well throw in my two bits on the matter."

        "user_review": "I really enjoy Dan Brown's stories. I have read Angels and Demon and The Da Vinci Code, I am currently reading Deception Point and plan on reading Digitial Fortress. I absolutely love his story telling. I have read mixed reviews and I think the negative reviews are just really people who are too serious in life. For goodness sake it is a book for entertainment, not a non-fiction story. Though I have read some non-fiction stories that are more fiction then Dan Brown's book. Brown's books are entertaining and make you look at thing in different ways which is good. Everytime I pick up Brown's book, I am totally immersed in the story and at the edge of my seat wanting to know what happens next. I can't wait until the next book.It took me a bit longer to finish this book then I expected, but I am so glad that I read it. Again, Dan Brown delivers a thought provoking story in his unique style. I know others really dislike Brown's style of writing saying that it follows a formula of the ultra dramatic and the never ending cliff hanger chapters, but I just don't tire of that at all. A great thrilling read. I can't wait to read the next Dan Brown book!"

        "user_review": "The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon, #3), Dan BrownThe Lost Symbol is a 2009 novel written by American writer Dan Brown.It is a thriller set in Washington, D.C., after the events of The Da Vinci Code, and relies on Freemasonry for both its recurring theme and its major characters.It is the third Brown novel to involve the character of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon, following 2000's Angels & Demons and 2003's The Da Vinci Code.Renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, at the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution.Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier.When Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh posing as Solomon's assistant, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries.Mal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere in Washington, D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be murdered.Langdon meets Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security.Sato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the U.S. and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate.Examining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «نماد گمشده»؛ «طلسم گمشده»؛ «نشان گم شده»؛ «نشانه ی گمشده»؛ »هزارتوی اسرار»؛ «رمز گمشده»؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و پنجم ماه دسامبر سال 2009میلادیعنوان: نماد گمشده؛ نویسنده: دن براون؛ مترجم: نوشین ریشهری؛تهران، نگارینه، 1388؛ در 672ص؛ شابک 9789642300068؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا -

Pace, suspense, mystery, humor and characters all good but everything feels just too repetitive. At this point, I'm starting to think that the problem partly lies with me since I'm reading the entire series in one go, as opposed to the average reader having at least a year between consecutive releases. So, I'm going to keep this one short without making the review a rant. If you're looking for sheer entertainment, this could work quite well for most, but that's pretty much all the good I could say. I'm convinced more and more that reading RL books back to back is a bad idea as this series unfolds.\"To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books.\""

        "user_review": "Dan Brown- image from AARP - photo by Drew GurionWhen one picks up a Dan Brown book there are certain expectations. First one can look forward to a fast-based adventure pitting the intellect of Robert Langdon against dark forces intent on creating mayhem of one sort or another. One expects that religion or religious institutions will play a central role in the story. One can expect that there will be puzzles to be solved and mysteries within mysteries. One can expect murderous sociopaths and police of questionable loyalty. One can expect that there will be a considerable quantity of payload in the form of interesting, arcane information. One can expect that once begun it will be a difficult book to put down. And Brown delivers on all of the above. If you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. That is not Brown's beat. Be prepared for some eye-rolling, as hyper-intelligent people make glaringly stupid decisions, all in the service of moving the plot along. And there are some notions at the end of the book that may be a bit much to swallow. But it is all in fun. It is what it is.

        "user_review": "I enjoyed reading Angels & Demons and The Da Vince Code, but Brown wasted a plot, wrote poorly and with less suspense, inner logic, and momentum. A reason might be that it´s hard to write series in the genre of epic, eyeopening, world shattering blockbuster epiphany hybrid thrillers, but at least the editors could truly have tried to make this better, it was disappointing to be left with such a facepalmy ending and a general meh feeling.The worst thing about such literary fails is that one is waiting for the action, the logic, the conclusion towards the end and then nothing, just lol rofl facepalm. Believe me, if you read (don´t do it) it, you will feel this immense disappointment when realizing that this is the explanation, the reason why you invested hours of time to be Brown pranked, browned, whatever.The reason might be that there is not just the stupid premise, but the missing good, well written and credible metaplot, the action, and the sheer freshness of the mentioned works and that it seems to me like a failed approach of producing the next mind penetrating revolution in the thriller market without using the working recipe for whatever reason. There would be so many conspiracy theories in different cultures that could be used to write series about, but this is a no go. I don´t understand why neither Brown nor the proofreaders saw this coming, so it remains the only interesting mystery surrounding this concoction.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "This is one of my least favorite books by Dan Brown in the Robert Langdon series. There are indeed some thrilling elements that are usually seen in Dan Brown's books, like clues, secrets, conspiracies, and history. The narration and plot were also engaging in the initial part.The kidnapping of Langdon's mentor Peter Solomon and Langdon's attempt to save him will initially take us on a roller coaster ride. But after some time, the readers will lose interest in the book as we have read so many similar stories. The ending was the most disappointing part. These might be the reasons why the people in Tinsel town discarded the option of making the silver-screen version of it.If you are a fan of the Robert Langdon series and have read all other books, you can opt for this book. Please go into this book without much expectation, as there is a high chance that you will be disappointed otherwise."

        "user_review": "I liked this novel actually better than DV Code and A & D, which is ironic as it wasn't quite the page turner as those were, but the plot and ideas were more believeable. I was very interested in The Masons, as they were so much a part of the early patriotic/revolutionary era of the US. As usual there is a gruesome evil person, with superhuman like skills and power. The whole story covers just 24 hours...wow, what a day!Interesting insight from Brown on the Masons or Noetic Science?: \"a temple of God\" refers to the \"temple\" of the brain; how \"the created,...becomes the Creator\"; when the eye is single, your body fills with light\". For me the last part of the book added to my personal confirmation of what faith is, and that \"our minds can generate energy capable of transforming physical matter.\" I believe as Katherine stated, \"As soon as we humans begin to harness our true power, we will have enormous control over our world..and be able to design reality, rather than merely react to it.\"How about this idea: God created us in his image, but not just our physical bodies resemble him, but our minds! Now that's a a great idea, and correlates with my LDS belief that we were all intelligences first, even before our spirits were created. Because of this, we have God-like potential power, and indeed can become like him. We just haven't learned all that is necessary ...yet. Interestingly, he refers to the Hebrew meaning of God, Elohim, which is plural. Hmmm, gives lots to think about, especially if you don't believe in God, or if your belief in God is limited.Love this idea also on p. 563, There are those who create, and those who tear down. The dynamic has existed for all time.Another perspective of atonement....\"gathering what is scattered...to bring order from chaos, to find \"at-one-ment\", from this vantage point, His characters discuss the inherent power of prayer groups, healing circles, singing in unison, worshipping en mass... unfortunately, no mention of Christ in that view, but there is still much truth there. \"We have barely scratched the surface of our mental and spiritual capabilities.\" Can you believe a popular fiction novel promoting such eternal truths? I'd love to talk to others about this, but my husband disliked the book. I thought it was great."

        "user_review": "Libro controversial sobre la religión y la ciencia, aunque a mí, me ha encantado.El tiempo es un rio... y los libros son barcos. Muchos volúmenes parten por esa corriente, pero encallan y se pierden en sus arenas. Solo unos pocos, muy pocos, resisten la prueba del tiempo y viven para bendecir los siglos sucesivos.Desde que leí el primer libro de Dan Brown, que fue Ángeles y Demonios, mentalmente lo he catalogado como un autor talentoso y muy valiente. Talentoso porque escribe muy bien sus novelas, y mantiene al lector enganchado todo el tiempo con sus conspiraciones y con las aventuras de Robert Langdon, su protagonista; valiente, porque escribir sobre Dios siempre, pero siempre, crea polémica en cualquier rincón del mundo sin importar nuestras creencias. Si declaras tú fe por Dios, te caerá una lluvia de burlas de parte de miles de escépticos; si declaras que eres ateo, los más religiosos empezarán a despreciarte por tus ideales. Y sí, con lo que acabo de escribir se puede llegar a la conclusión de que el problema no es la fe, ni Dios, sino el problema es la falta de tolerancia y respeto que tenemos hacia los demás porque no piensan igual que nosotros. Pero, volviendo al tema del autor, atreverse a escribir una saga en la que sus libros exponen diferentes teorías sobre Dios, es igual de osado que lanzarse desde un gran trampolín, con los ojos cerrados, y sin saber si en la parte de abajo la piscina tendrá agua: Atrevido, pero interesante; atrevido, pero original. No sé si es confianza excesiva, simple osadía, o si no le importan las críticas, pero su intrepidez lo hace un autor muy especial. Dan Brown, es un autor el cual puede ser fuertemente criticado, pero también puede ser muy elogiado, todo dependiendo de la disposición del lector. La única forma de saber si nos gustarán los libros de Dan Brown es arriesgándonos y leyéndolos. Es la única forma porque no es recomendable crear una imagen de él, confiando en el criterio de las demás personas cuando la fe, y las creencias, están de por medio.Es más, puede volverse aún más complicado. ¿Por qué? Porque según mi opinión, el segundo libro, llamado El código da Vinci, no es recomendable para los lectores que son muy fieles a Dios, y que les molesta que «inventen» historias sobre los santos, la Virgen María, Jesucristo, y demás. Pero, este tercer volumen, siento que no está orientado para las personas que no creen en Dios. Es más, a algunos creyentes también les molestará. Irónico, ¿verdad? Pues sí, y mucho. Pero esa es la conclusión a la que he llegado, después de leer un texto el cual presenta una teoría muy radical sobre la ciencia y su vínculo con la religión, la biblia, capacidades extrasensoriales del ser humano, etc. Es un texto que propone una teoría sobre el mundo y la humanidad tan diferente de todo lo que había conocido, que me ha dejado pensando mucho durante varias noches sobre la posibilidad de que algo así fuera realidad. Y lo he pensado porque la verdad me encantaría que fuera realidad. Y sí, sé que es ficción, pero es que el autor presenta la información de tal manera que todo empieza a tener sentido. Si la vida fuera tal y como se describe en susodicha teoría, encontraríamos miles de respuestas a miles de acontecimientos que no tienen sentido en nuestra historia: Sería fantástico. Pero naturalmente, esto solo es una conspiración, y como toda conspiración siempre se presentan los datos de forma apropiada para que la teoría parezca realidad. El problema es que amo las conspiraciones, y por ello, esta en especial me ha dejado completamente maravillado. Como se pueden dar cuenta es muy complicado dar una opinión personal sobre el tema principal de esta novela, teniendo en cuenta que puedes perder la imparcialidad dependiendo de que tanto crees en la conspiración que presenta Dan Brown.Ahora bien, retirando de por medio el tema religioso que es tan importante aquí, se puede describir esta novela como un thriller muy trepidante. Me molestó al inicio que presentaran demasiados flashbacks porque se alteró mucho el ritmo del argumento, y también que repitieran algunas informaciones ya que los personajes estaban descubriendo datos que como lectores ya conocíamos, pero después de una parte el libro toma un ritmo frenético de aventura, peligros, muchísima acción, secretos, criptología, etc. Es demasiado adictiva esta lectura, y más teniendo en cuenta el uso de capítulos cortos. Les juro que no quería parar de leer. Fueron 622 páginas que devoré con un hambre voraz. No sentí cansancio, no me aburrí nunca, el argumento me pareció súper interesante, e incluso quedé con ganas de leer La Biblia. Con eso lo digo todo.Los personajes han estado bien desarrollados, no en exceso, pero sí con la suficiente información para que cada uno cumpla su rol. No obstante, si tuviera que pensar en un personaje para destacar, naturalmente me inclinaría por el antagonista. Podría decirse que está sugestionado por tantas creencias, ritos y demás, pero en verdad es un personaje muy malvado. Además, es muy inteligente, por lo que sus planes son brillantes y da gusto conocerlos. También posee un pasado muy, pero muy bien pensado, y aunque al principio sentí pereza por conocer su historia ya que interrumpía el ritmo de la novela, a medida que fui avanzando dejé de sentir eso porque el autor nos presenta más trozos de su historia, y cada vez su vida se va tornando más, y más interesante. Un gran villano que le aportó a la historia crímenes, violencia, brutalidad, y mucha, pero mucha maldad. El mejor personaje del libro ha sido el antagonista.En resumen, una historia que jamás tendrá película porque es demasiado controversial y puede ser criticada fuertemente tanto por los religiosos, como los apasionados por la ciencia. No comprendía la razón por la que muchas personas detestan esta historia, pero después de reflexionar creo entender que se debe a las «creencias» que mencioné anteriormente. Naturalmente, si yo encontrara un libro donde ofendieran, o contaran una historia diferente de mi familia, que es lo más sagrado para mí, pues lo más normal sería odiar aquel libro con toda la fuerza de mi corazón. Por ello, comprendo a quienes no les gusta este libro, su opinión es muy respetable.Prosa genial, ritmo genial (no al inicio), adrenalina, crimen, violencia, secretos, etc. Un libro muy adictivo, perfecto para quienes sufren un bloqueo lector, y necesitan una lectura ligera para volver a tomar confianza. Además, es un libro independiente, por lo que no se necesita haber leído anteriormente Ángeles y Demonios, ni tampoco El código Da Vinci. Mi calificación es de cinco estrellas porque he quedado muy satisfecho con el contenido, porque la teoría conspirativa me ha encantado, y porque tiene muchas frases interesantes que destacar en la parte final (para quienes leen el libro con mente abierta). Próximo destino, Inferno.¿Libro recomendado?"

        "user_review": "Dan Brownis one of my favorite authors. I know there are several of my online and in-person (sounds so weird!) friends who disagree, but ultimately... you have to acknowledge the amount of time and dedication he puts into his story, the vast eccentric cast of characters, the intrigue and suspense, the unexpected connections and the fast-paced thrill of turning the pages more quickly than you can actually read each one. People love books for different reasons. It's not always the \"beautiful and lyrical prose\" or the \"emotional gut punch you feel from its reality.\"These books are meant to keep your heart racing, your mind guessing and your eyes unable to blink for a few minutes at a time. At the time I'm writing this review, it's been about five years since I read the book, and I still haven't seen the movie... but I am excited to watch it, though I haven't heard great things from those who have.Of the four Robert Langdon books in the series, this was my least favorite. Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code had such complex and shocking story lines, I couldn't help but be amazed. Inferno was so intense and ripe with \"what if\" scenarios, my mind was non-stop going. With this book, it's still a huge and complex puzzle, but it felt a little weaker than the other ones. There was a different type of emotional connection given Langdon's friendship with the kidnapped mentor.I liked the puzzle, but were pictures necessary?It was a little too easy to solve this time.It felt a bit repetitive at times.But you still flip the pages faster than a normal read.I'd push you to read his other books. I'd be OK if you skipped this one.But I am still super excited about Origin, the fifth in the series, which will debut later this year.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

        "user_review": "Now boarding on track 33, the Symbolism Express departing for the Freemasons, the Invisible College, the Office of Security, the SMSC, the Institute of Noetic Sciences and multiple points around the cryptic compass.Your temporal destination, not Paris and London, but Washington, D.C.Your conductor, Harvard symbiologist Robert Langdon, the Indiana Jones of the new age.Tied to the tracks in the gathering darkness ahead and facing certain death, if not embarrassment, another keeper of the ancient mysteries including the wisdom of Solomon, not a man of the Louvre, but a man of the Smithsonian.Traveling alone, an attractive female relative of the man lashed to the tracks, not agent and cryptologist Sophie Neveu, but Noetic scientist Dr Katherine Solomon.Sitting in the engineer's seat with a small stone pyramid rather than a chalice holding down the deadman's pedal, a rogue and tattooed Mason in search of apotheosis replaces Silas, \"The Da Vinci Code's\" rogue and scourged monk as our antagonist for the evening.Hold on. It's going to be another bumpy ride.Dreams of déjà vu remind you what the journey will be like: short chapters, multiple points of view, conflicting agendas with something very large (yet unknown) at stake, the thrill of the chase, the almost-sexual tension of near-satisfaction again and again as answers appear and disappear, multiple station stops for arcane wisdom instruction, and a desperate-save-humanity-hunt for secrets you've stared at your entire life without comprehending.By the end of the novel, you won't be a 33rd Degree Mason and you won't be like unto a god in any way you can quite wrap your mind around, but you will have experienced a high-adrenaline ride. This thrill is what the journey is all about. Perhaps reality lurks around the edge of the plot and theme and perhaps sacred messages lurk within the vast white spaces between the lines of black type, but that's not why we're turning the pages from 1 to 509.Dan Brown has done it again, and upon reflection at the dawn's first light, you'll see that he knows how to pull the right strings and push the right buttons and sprinkle the right esoteric seasonings across his smorgasbord of mysteries from around the world to keep readers addicted for the trip. On the last page, you may well hope, along with Robert Langdon and Katherine Solomon that men and women will follow the ancient maps toward their true potential; but seriously, the novel's destination really doesn't matter, does it, because the ride was the peak experience you were seeking when you picked up \"The Lost Symbol.\"All aboard."

(to enjoy some truly great bad, relish the self-consciously lascivious descriptions of the bad guy's naked body, they are made of awesome.) it's not so much that the plot is shaky -- i expect it to be shaky, and if this plot could be drawn, it would have to be drawn by dr. seuss. it's that i would expect, at least, that the book actually END SOMEWHERE.as i recall of the da vinci code, the details of which don't stick in my mind, there WAS a conclusion of sorts, the Big Secret did actually turn out to be something -- that whole Jesus Got Laid revelation that everyone got their panties in a wad about. in this one, i was so confused by the end that i lost track of what The Big Secret was supposed to be, and i don't think one was ever actually given. it started as a Place that contained a Thing ... then it was a Place that contained a Word ... then there was no Place but there was a Word ... then there WAS a Place and a Word which was perhaps a Thing after all ... after that, i fuzz out, i have no idea what the conclusion was.dan brown just sort of rambles about some ideas he must have found interesting after watching a lot of The Learning Channel and reading some Joseph Campbell. a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, dan. a very little.but you know what? that's ok. it's a supermarket book. it's an airplane read, and sometimes i like an airplane read, just like sometimes i eat a donut for dinner. but if you're going to drag me through a book that starts and stops and lurches and jerks like a teenager in driver's ed, for god's sake dan, GIVE IT AN ENDING.anything can be forgiven with a decent ending. you obviously didn't have anything in mind when you started and i'm sorry, kiddo, but your talents are not great enough to take you to unexpected places. leave that to the big boys. you go steal another interesting conclusion about a historical/religious/mythological item and work backwards. you are not good enough to ruminate randomly and have it come together as something meaningful.watch that petard, brother, after it hoists you high, it'll drop you hard."

        "user_review": "I think I finally figured out why I hate Dan Brown. He writes very average thriller/ mystery books, just like many others do, and the thing is that I don't have a problem with the other writers. Sometimes their books are entertaining, sometimes they are not, sometimes they are poorly written, sometimes they are not so bad, and I'm perfectly fine with it. The thing I can't stand about Dan Brown is his attitude. He truly believes he has been invested with the power of 'omniscience', and he looks down at the reader as if he were talking to a bunch of retarded individuals (which we actually probably are just by virtue of the fact that we are reading his books). But this is still ok, it doesn't upset me all that much.What I think is unacceptable is the fact that in his 'all encompassing knowledge', all we find is an endless bunch of lies, lies about the most obvious evidence anybody can prove. Angels and Demons, which takes place in Rome, is filled with sentences in Italian, except that Mr. Brown didn't even bother looking up the spelling of the words and, as if that were not enough, he invented words to look cool in the eyes of his readers which, come on, wouldn't be able to pick all the bull I'm trying to sell them in a million years!In the Italian version of The Lost Symbol, I noticed that the translators skipped more than one passage because what DB had written not only wasn't accurate, it was blatantly WRONG! So, I don't know if they didn't want to look stupid themselves or did it to try and give Mr. Brown a better image abroad. Just one tiny detail out of many: Classical Greek 101 - Apo is a preposition, with different meanings but still and only a preposition, for sure not a verb. No!!! not in the Lost Key. Dan Brown has to show us he knows the ethimology of the word apotheosis, and so Apo, for him, turns into a verb, and he lectures us as if he were revealing this great truth. I read on a review that his books are an insult to human intelligence. I agree, and not because they are necessarily awful books, but because taking reality and twisting it so that it can fit the story line and, on top of that, selling it as if it were some kind or revelation we can only obtain through Dan Brown's grace, to me is unacceptable."

        "user_review": "I'm a fan of Dan Brown. I've read all his books - not justThe Da Vinci CodeandAngels & Demons, but alsoDeception PointandDigital Fortress. I like his writing style, how his books are layered with codes and mysteries, and how they're so fast-paced they make my heart beat faster because I feel pulled into the stories and into the lives of his characters.The Lost Symbolis the third book in the Robert Langdon series, and I was glad to see that Brown brought this dynamic and entertaining character back to the United States from Europe and the UK in his previous books. The book starts with a bang, pulling me in within the first few paragraphs, though I didn't feel quite as captivated by this story as I had with his previous two.As with numbers 1 and 2 in the series, there's a format to the story: Robert Langdon, Harvard professor and expert on symbology and religious iconography find himself embroiled in the middle of a high-stakes religious mystery, where a long-debated and highly protected secret is on the verge of being exposed to the masses and ruined for those who have long stood to protect it. There is, of course, the supporting female character, a smart and capable woman who helps fill in the gaps where Langdon's knowledge leaves off. As was true to the past two books, there is physical and emotional danger, as well as a deranged villain who is at once brilliant, physically superior, and acting in what he believes to be the best interest of the world.Despite the true-to-form shape of this book, though, it stands well on its own as a book. Although I enjoyed the reading of this book from beginning to end, it wasn't until the final chapters that I felt a strong connection with it, and that is because the view of religion that Brown describes here - as in both of his previous books in the series - falls directly in line with my own personal beliefs of religion and the concept of God. Readers who criticized his previous explanations of such topics will likely find much to refute and criticize here as well, but for me it's like a breath of fresh air, to know that I'm not the only one who sees the universe in greater terms than just a church and its congregants.This was an entertaining read, as always, and I'm glad to add it to my collections with his other works. I'm sure I'll enjoy reading this particular book more in the future."

So I guess I'll start with my point.This book F*CKING BLOWS. F*ck you, Dan Brown, you smug bastard, for insulting my intelligence like nobody's business. I really liked Angels and Demons, was entertained by The Da Vinci Code, and this book had half the content (not to mention a sixteenth of the climax) of the latter in almost twice the number of pages.Do you get paid by the modifier? Or the number of hits of the term \"secret wisdom\"? BUY A GODDAMN THESAURUS. LEARN SOME NEW F*CKING VERBS. Do you ever get sick of writing the following dialogue?\"But that can't possibly be true!\"\"Why not Robert?\"\"My sharp intellect and well-toned physique just won't let me believe it!\"Seriously, every other f*cking chapter has that conversation, but with way more modifiers and whining, not to mention that it usually takes up a whole f*cking page.And the shit of it is, it's not even f*cking suspenseful. He literally just keeps you waiting. He doesn't even hide it anymore. The f*cker knows you're going to keep reading anyway, so why even bother to be creative with the cliffhangers?And the puzzles are even straightforward! Even though I don't hold a degree in Symbollogy (Yeah f*cking right. I still contend that he made that word up. Watch the f*cking Boondock Saints, Dan Brown.), a handful of them are completely obvious, and I swear he recycled at least one from Angels and Demons.And only one revelation in the whole book is remotely shocking. And I did see it coming. The rest of them are just inane letdowns. When I hear, \"issue of national security,\" I think nukes-- not the pussy shit this guy is threatening.Deep breath.Moral of the story, please don't feed the author. And moral number two: if the back cover of a book contains solely \"Critical Raves for Another Book,\" I should know better."

        "user_review": "\"Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand.\"― Dan Brown, The Lost SymbolI know that a lot of readers do not find Dan Brown's writing style appealing, but in my opinion, l think he writes very captivating novels. I won't go into details of the plot line or the action that takes place, but I will say that if you are a fan of action, drama, conspiracy theories, and history then you probably should give this one a shot. Brown uses point of view brilliantly to increase suspense. His books are fairly quick easy reads, but they are full of excitement and surprises. It is hard to have a novel keep you guessing until the end like this one does."

Angels and Demons set a bar for Brown, and he just hasn't been able to match it since. It reads just like The DaVinci Code, with its plot changed to Washington, D.C. It's a completely improbable plot mixed with even more improbable character developments and plot twists.So disappointed. If I'd known, I never would have bought the book in the first place, and certainly not in hardcover."

        "user_review": "This was another neat thriller by symbolism and thriller author Dan Brown. In this latest edition to the Robert Langdon books, our favorite Mickey Mouse watch carrying college professor is invited to give a talk in DC by an old friend. When the friend goes missing (or rather, is kidnapped in a rather gruesome way), and old masonic symbols provide a path leading to his whereabouts, Langdon is forced to go on the hunt. Robert Langdon may be the king of mansplaining, but I find it so darn interesting every time he does it.This book had lots of cool stuff on masonic lore, Washington DC symbolism, the Founding Fathers, and more. At first, the level of detail slowed the storytelling and things took a little while to get going (unlike some of Brown's other books that I thought started with a bang), however by about 30% in, things were rocking right along and the backstories once explained, made sense and really added to things. And oh, the twists. Dan Brown, you always surprise me!"

It was a huge part of my childhood.What's more, this book is part of the reason I'm a decent public speaker these days. I joined forensics because this was the book that was being used for extemporaneous reading. (I didn't even know what forensics was when I started, just that I liked the book.)And there are things I like here. Good things. It's a fun adventure story. There are cool settings. Action. Tension. The different nature of the islands is cool. There's mystery. Magic. Wonder. The character of Reepicheep alone boosts this book by a full star.The character of Eustace is better than I remember him being, too. It's nice to see a kid who is a total dick learn that there's consequences to his actions, then have a redemption arc in a kid's book.But reading this book to my little boy made me confront a lot of the problems in the book. There are slavers in the early chapters, which is something I didn't remember. And a topic I wasn't sure I wanted to introduce to my kid at the age of 6.There's a fair chunk of sexism too. Little things scattered throughout the books. Not terrible considering when it was written. But still nothing I want soaking into my kid's psyche. The best example of this is Ramandu's daughter. Caspian meets her, and it becomes obvious that they're going to get married.Let's just pass lightly over the fact that she's effectively being treated like a prize for him completing his quest and jump right into the fact that SHE DOESN'T HAVE A NAME! She's referred to as \"Ramandu's daughter\" through the entire book despite the fact that she has a larger part in the book.That's fucked up, y'all.There's narrative issues too. The children rarely solve their own problems. Several times they're confronted by bad situations or make bad choices but then instead of having to deal with the consequences or figure out solutions, Aslan shows up and is all ಠ_ಠ. Then, under the weight of his disappointed dad eyes and they're filled with shame and realize they should stop being dicks. That's not good storytelling. That's some deus ex leo bullshit.It's a good book, and I'm fond of it. But it's not perfect, and its flaws are large enough that they bear some serious consideration before you put it in front of your kids."

Usually, in the Narnia series, there is a build up to an ultimate battle. However, this book did not follow that format. All of the adventures were pretty mild.*The ending felt rushed and not particularly memorable or special especially when compared to the ending of The Magician's Nephew.Overall, a quick read but low key adventures and nothing particularly spectacular.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones's DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta"

Eustace is a great character, in that he behaves as a few most certainly would, with utter disbelief, shock, and also borderline horror at the 'backward' Narnian reality, as well as forever questioning and assigning his own ideas of the motives and aims of his fellow crew.The trip sailing East, allows C.S. Lewis to really expand on the Narnia reality and show us what else is out there, which he does with aplomb. It's C.S. Lewis goes wild with a mesh of dark fairy tale style adventures from dragons and one-legged bouncing dwarves to clouds of darkness and mesmerising mer-people. It's Lewis's creativity and gift for storytelling that should dwarf (pun intended?) any and all Christian symbolism in the series. Another gem!"

I can't imagine how Lewis created such imaginative images in his head and made people see it clearly.The ending was a bit sad, though. This is the time for the last goodbye, and I knew even if there should be more, but it's enough in the story for the children to grow up and keep in their mind that this is the farewell.All in all, the chronicles of Narnia is worth reading when I have nothing to read. It makes my head spin (in a good way) and it keeps me want to go back and be a kid again.\"Courage, dear heart.\"https://goo.gl/wQ7bbm"

        "user_review": "This is my fourth journey into the fantastical lands of Narnia, as I have chosen to read the series in chronological rather than publication order.This started rather poignantly for me, as the story opens with two of the Pevensie siblings returning to Narnia, with their cousin Eustace in tow. Without the elder Pevensie children I initially felt like some of the earlier allure was lost for me, as it acted as a reminder that we all reach an age where we grow up and magic refuses to become a possibility. I quickly forgot my reservations and was once again swept away by the wonderment and awe this series inspires, however.The children find themselves thrown from this world into the ocean that borders the Narnian lands. The nearby ship, the Dawn Voyager, quickly hoists them on board and the children are happily reunited with characters from the previous book, King Caspian and Reepicheep the talking (and quarrelsome) mouse. The crew are venturing into the perilous unknown seas with the ambition of discovering more about their world and ending their journey by hopefully venturing into Aslan's country.I adored getting to explore more of this fantastical world. It added an element of adventure and highlighted Lewis' spectacular world-building artistry. This seemed to read almost like a series of connected short stories, as each island they landed on had a tale relating to it that ended as the crew disembarked.As with every other story in this series, there was a moralistic edge to the plot that served as a reminder of good behaviour for its young readership. This rather preachy element is one that doesn't fit well with its contemporary readers, in my opinion, and, whilst not ruining my enjoyment of the series, isn't a factor a particularly appreciate."

Also, I haven't read it as a kid, so this is my first experience with this classic. I liked this one more than number two (Prince Caspian), and this might very well be my favourite book so far. I loved the sailing theme, and I am a sucker for stories about voyages at sea. This one, in particular, was more a collection of single stories (as the ship containing the characters sails from island to island, they live different adventures), just like those classic sailing books likeGulliver's Travelsor even theOdyssey, which I love. But even though all adventures were enjoyable, if sometimes a little too short (the book itself is under 200 pages), the last chapters were simply amazing. Glad I chose to go on with this series!"

I call age discrimination!I'll be interested to see how the last two books of this series go without our four base characters. Peter, Susan, Edmond and Lucy, it been the fabbiest hanging out with you guys. Alas, you get old and no longer eligible to enter Narnia, is there no justice?Enjoyed riding the waves in this book, by jove we had an adventure!3 stars."

I love that while I'm reading them, I remember the pure joy I had with them as a child, and now, I'm in my thirties, everything seems so much more vivid and I can definitely say this may have been the most memorable reread so far.I love the magic of this story, from how Eustace eventually learns that his actions have consequences and kind of becomes more likeable, and how Lucy recognises her worth. I especially appreciate the part with Aslan. I love him so much, and I think he would love me too.I found the ending particularly poignant as the children are growing up, as we obviously all do. But, the beauty is, these wonderful books allow me to escape to this fascinating world whenever I feel like it."

        "user_review": "I knew that the new film version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was going to be bad. I did not know that it was going to be that retarded that I'd question my faith in my own taste. (Not that I don't like retarded stuff. But boring too? Ouch.) Was the book that bad? I don't remember all of it. It's been years since I've read it. Lauren, you're never picking the movie ever again.A video game version of the movie would be better than the movie. At least it would be more difficult! What the fuck was up with the swords? Was that ALL there was to it? I seem to remember there was more... \"Hey, there's the lord's sword. Pick it up.\" There were all these old lords with ZZ Top beards and no one bust out into \"She's got legs\"? I guess they forgot how to use them when they were asleep for that long. I seem to remember there was more to the lords than that. I seem to remember that Caspian learned more than a trite \"Be your own man\" message relating to his hero worship of the dad he didn't know (the movie seems to forget that he didn't know his dad). There was more than gripping the flaccid swords of old men and daddy never touched me as a child. Wasn't there?The looks thing? What the? Lucy didn't perform a spell to look \"beautiful\" like Susan (I'm enough of a girl that I thought \"Well, she's not THAT pretty...\"). She used it to eavesdrop. She found out that her friend said something she didn't mean about her behind her back. Because she did that, they would never be friends the same way again. What Lucy really learned was that people are pissy bitches and one bad mood isn't them all the time. Girls can insult your ugly sweater and still really (sometimes secretly) admire you.I know that Eustace becoming a dragon and the process of becoming \"himself\" again was more. I loved that in the book it wasn't some pansy \"Be nice\" message. Eustace was a jerk because he was afraid of everything, afraid to think for himself. In the movie he learns to be what the \"cool kids\" want instead of just not being afraid to change. What the? Boo! The \"be yourself\" message about Lucy and Caspian did not mesh with the \"be like everybody else\" message they inflicted on the audience about poor Eustace. (The kid who played Eustace was the only good actor in the film. Lucy is an embarrassment. Also inappropriate! She did that wide-eyed wonder grin when her cousin was stuck as a dragon! What idiots let that one go by? They made their heroine look like a bitch.)Okay, they made a lot of mistakes in the pretty bad Prince Caspian film. He shouldn't have been old. It was nothing to meet him again later on in his life if he's still a young man. The stupid Susan romance? Who cares when he meats (Freudian slip) the star chick if they are pissed he forgets about Susan? I hated that movie. It was pre-school LOTR films battle scenes. They got all wrong what were the good parts of the book.I know that Edmund admits to being a shit for his first Narnia visit. This is not mentioned in the film. I liked that about Edmund in the book.Nothing new here: I always loathed Reepicheep. He's the little thing that runs his big mouth so no one will underestimate him. If he was really that good he wouldn't have to run his mouth. He's also the biggest mouth peice for Aslan-mania.The \"Bad stuff happens have faith anyway\" stuff. I remember that The Last Battle is the most overtly religious book in the series and I managed to ignore the rest in the other books. They upped the ante? Am I a harder sell?I don't like this. I feel more or less the same person as before. I'll still read the kids and ya books that recognize the parts of you that you can carry on with you. Not the bad taste for silly melodrama parts but the \"That happened and I can't pretend it didn't\" experiences. Narnia was such a good part of my life. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was the first book I really remember reading. I don't want it to be the bad part that I only pretended was good to get by.P.s. I don't wanna be all Comic Book Guy, but it annoyed the effing hell out of me that Eustace's mom announces in the end that \"Jill Pole is here to see you!\" Jill wasn't his friend before! Eustace didn't have friends. So annoying.Oh yeah! I forgot to say what I thought about writing here while watching that dumb ass movie. They really wasted a golden chance. C.S. Lewis made digs about the loss of freedoms for kids, school systems that babied kids and at the same time allowed fucked up shit to go on so they wouldn't \"Stifle\" anybody. Kids today have no freedom. Parents will call the cops on each other if they run around outside and play. Yet here was Edmund and Lucy having to be shut-in after they had lived it up as free-thinking adults in Narnia. Instead? They waste it all by bamming audiences on the head about doing what Aslan wants. That doesn't mesh with the good parts of the Narnia series that I remembered it to have.EDIT- Lauren will be pissed at me for not mentioning the glow in the dark \"eevel\" green mist. What the hell was that? I don't remember that. They should just let me write these things. The BBC tv movies back in the day combined Voyage and Prince. Probably because the actual plots were so thin. That's why they should let me do it. I'd have made the whole thing a dragon eating its own skin off movie. Prince Caspian would have been a refugee movie.Lauren really hated the actor who played the magician. You know they are a nobody if they weren't in Harry Potter (some exceptions allowed for LOTR actors)."

        "user_review": "Read this aloud to my kids. It was always one of my favorites of the Narnia books, I was always fascinated by the dreamlike quality of the ending and the different islands they visit. The one thing about Lewis is that you'll be going along, reading about a pool of water that turns everything to gold, or an island full of one-legged dwarfs who got accidentally turned invisible, and you're like, what fun fantasy this is! And then suddenly there's a Lamb offering the children grilled fish that was the most delicious thing they have ever eaten, then turning into a Lion, and you're like, if this is totally heavy Christian allegory, then what about the rest of it? Who are the Dufflepuds, in Christian symbolism? And then your brain cries a little.And yes, the bit with Eustace and the dragon is also clearly allegory, but it can still be enjoyed as pure fantasy if you want. Love that part. Love Eustace's horribleness."

I enjoyed the quick wit of King Caspian, how he had a response to Eustace when he told about his big ship back home. The English is a bit harder to read in some chapters of this story. I haven't read many classics for this reason and don't get me started with Shakespeare because I don't understand the written language in it at all.This book started with Eustace Clarence, Lucy's cousin. This summer, Lucy's family got split up. Susan and her parents traveled to America, Peter stayed at the Professor's home, while Edmund and Lucy were to stay with their cousin Eustace's family. One day at their aunt's house, they found a way back to Narnia, aboard a ship and bringing along Eustace. At first encounter, Lucy and Edmund were reunited with King Caspian. This time, one year in England was only 3 years in Narnia, unlike in book 2, it seemed like thousands of years went by. In this book, Caspian took an adventure by sea to look for his late father's missing Lords. This story was again narrated by the author.The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was well written and an enjoyable read! Eustace seemed like a horrible boy but it's funny to read his diary entries and his lost adventures. I'm not too fond of the sea and especially when there's bad weather. I do; however, enjoyed every time when they discovered new land. The mystery with the dragon was good and I haven't read one like it. I also liked the Island of the Voices. It's fun, imaginative, and a little creepy when Lucy had to go upstairs. Overall, this book was a good read and I do recommend everyone to read it.xoxo, Jasmine atwww.howusefulitis.wordpress.comfor more details"

        "user_review": "Having read the first book back in Christmas and feeling confused about the reading order I'll say that this was a very enjoyable and easy to read children's book. I'm still struggling to find out who the reading order of Narnia is. I've seen that this is either the 2nd or the 5th book but then again I've seen it being named the 3rd book. I'm just going to read it however I want and hope it'll all be fine. At least, I don't there was any missing detail from the book, so that must be a good thing.As to why I gave this 3 stars is because I found it less adventurous than the first one, I felt this one was a bit rushed and yes that's the way children's books usually are but it was a bit too much for me. I loved the characters, although some of the characters of the first book were missing, but we had a new one on the children side, and several new ones on the world of Narnia.A journey in the sea on a ship named Dawn Treader. C. S. Lewis is a masterful author, very laconic but at the same time his words are utterly descriptive. The thing with children's books is that they always make me feel nostalgic and give me this feeling we all had as children, I feel carefree."

Also the introduction of their cousin Eustace who sees out the end of the series.While spending the summer with their bratty spoiled cousin Eustace Clarence Scrubb. the younger put out Pevensie children notice a portrait of a unmistakably Narnian ship. while trying to explain Narnia to their obstinate cousin they fall into the portrait. thus began their epic sea voyage. Caspian is on a mission to find the 7 lords loyal to his father exiled by Miraz a decade before. But a bigger mission is harbored in the heart Reepicheep that to find Aslan's country to the east at the edge of the world.Many adventures ensue they shut down a Calormen slave market, Eustace get turned in a dragon, enter a bad storm, almost die of thirst, meet a magician and his Dufflepods, get attacked by a sea monster, discover a fallen star and see sights like a lake that turns things to gold and a island of darkness full of waking dreams (nightmares). one minor quibble the adventures at the beginning take to long spending chapters with the dufflepods and on the lone islands. but a few pages on the sea monster, dark island, and former star toward the end. This leads the pacing to seem to pick up toward the end. along with is arching pace their is a nice character arch as the bothersome Eustace turns in and alright boy. i mean it's still not Edmund's traitor to hero story but it's still growth of a sort. everyone agree that he was a better type of boy except his mother who said \"he had become commonplace and tiresome\". oh, a mother's love!the adventures on the voyage are entertaining and reflect a life lead by faith. if your willing to look for the ideological imagery. But did not get in the way of my enjoyment of the tale. Enjoyed this solid tale of Narnia!"

Nostalgic and comforting, but also with so much more to pull from now as I read as an adult. There are quite a few classical and theological allusions in here that I never noticed before. I better understand the disappointment with the movie. Talk about drawing from the least interesting part of the adventure!Also the first few chapters had me shipping Caspian and Lucy which just goes to show (as my housemate says) that I have a knack for shipping the wrong couple.My favorite part of this re-read was when Eustace doesn't know what a dragon is because \"he didn't read the right kind of books\" and when Edmund thinks critically about something because \"he read detective stories.\" It just goes to show that it is good to incorporate lots of fiction in your life!"

        "user_review": "In the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, King Caspian of Narnia takes to sea, sailing eastward to find the seven lords who were sent to eastern islands years ago by Miraz. Lucy and Edmund are at the present staying with their aunt and uncle and their intolerable cousin, Eustace. While admiring a picture of a sailing ship in Lucy's bedroom, they find them drawn in to the picture and transported in to Narnian waters right along with their whinny cousin.It was a pleasant adventure story to read. The voyage takes them all to different islands where some trial awaited them. The different trials they meet at different locations and the descriptive details so beautifully written about each of those places they sailed were quite fascinating. And Eustace's ill humor added a comical effect. However, comparatively with other books in the Chronicles, this book lacked action and suspense. It was rather a surprise for me as the movie version was more action packed.The human characters were rather flat, perhaps except Eustace. I did like the character development of Eustace from being arrogant, complaining and self centered to the humble, enduring and helpful boy. The bravery, strength and courage of Lucy, Edmund and Caspian - the Narnian Kings and queen, were displayed poorly. I felt there was more bravery and courage in the little mouse, Reepicheep. Honestly, it was the most interesting character of the lot. And most of all I missed the presence of Aslan, whose appearance was scarce.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the read. It is hard not to enjoy these chronicles in spite of certain flaws. There is indeed some magic that keeps the reader engaged. :)With his read, I've completed five books of the chronicles in their chronological order. I'm determined to read the rest and complete the series. So, the next one will be The Silver Chair."

Besides, there's over a thousand reviews of this book on GR (hard to believe--I must have been one of the few people who haven't read this book)! Anyway, it was definitely the best book I've read all year, and probably one of the best books I've EVER read. It was easy to read (the story flowed very smoothly), yet emotionally, it was very difficult to read. Parts of the book just tore me up inside, and I had to take frequent breaks to wipe my tears. I loved the broken and bitter prostitute heroine, Angel, and the saintly, patient (too good to be true) farmer hero, Michael. But to categorize them that way seems so unfair, because they were so much more than that.I guess this book could be called religious fiction, or inspirational romance, but don't let that scare you. It's based on the bible story of Hosea and Gomer, but you don't have to be up on your bible studies to enjoy this one. And it gets just slightly preachy at the end, but you won't care because you'll be too wrapped up in Angel and Michael. The book deals with some really horrible and heartbreaking stuff (child rape, prostitution, incest)(but not in real explicit terms) and just when you think you've read the worst, something else is revealed that will break your heart all over again. But please try to get through those moments, because there is a beautifully written romance, too, about unconditional love, faith, and hope. I must have cried buckets while reading the last 100 pages, but it was worth it. I don't think I'll forget this story for quite a while--5 stars!"

Extraordinary...I could go on and on and still not justify the magnitude of this story's brilliance— what it means, what it stands for, and how deeply it has affected me.ReadingRedeeming Lovewas an intensely humbling and inspirational experience. It isn't about drama or angst or sexy loves scenes...it is a powerful, eye-opening story focused on faith and redemption; on rising up from the dust of despair and finding yourself worthy. It's about the unparalleled ways love and faith can conquer all, and I could not have been more pleased with this loving and fulfilling journey.Sarah, aka, Angel is a beautiful, damaged woman who remains a prisoner of a past that heartlessly sold her into prostitution as a child. She was abandoned, abused, and alone, and my heart shattered for her. Selling her body was all she'd ever known...so when Michael attempts to show her an honest life, she is untrusting and feels unworthy to receive it. Angel had a quiet strength and I was completely blown away by her transformation. Her quest for freedom was relentless and she easily became one of my most beloved heroines.Michael, in my opinion, was saint-like. His patience and love for Angel was astonishing, and his faith in himself and in God--inspiring. I've never before felt such a strong sense of love and acceptance through a character. Angel and Michael's connection stands as a pure example of love in its most honest and unconditional state...exactly how it's meant to be.The writing simplywow'dme. It was eloquent and its grace brought this story to life. I felt every pain and heartache displayed within these broken characters, as well as every rejoice.This was my first Christian Fiction novel and I was initially unsure what to expect. Although faith in God plays a big role in this story, having faith in oneself is an equally apparent theme—one to which anyone can relate. The element of religionwasheavily pronounced, but I didn't find it to be preachy — in fact, I found it comforting and enlightening. It wasn't over-the-top; it was delicate and its message seemed to transcend the structures of organized religion. Freedom does not come from without, but is instead brought forth from within.My song for SarahBlackbird singing in the dead of nightTake these broken wings and learn to flyAll your lifeYou were only waiting for this moment to arise.Blackbird singing in the dead of nightTake these sunken eyes and learn to seeAll your lifeYou were only waiting for this moment to be free...Book Stats:▪\t Genre/Category:Christian Fiction/Romance▪\t Steam Caliber:Clean▪ Romance:Emotional and heartbreaking.

        "user_review": "I recieved this as a part of the First Reads program.I was repulsed by this book.It's supposed to be a Christian romance novel. Full disclosure, I'm an atheist, so I wasn't expecting to exactly fall in love with the book. But I found the concept of the story of Hosea being retold during the Gold Rush interesting, or else I wouldn't have picked it up.So you may ask, why was I so repulsed by this book? Looking past the forced marriage, rape, beatings and child rape described in the book. Also looking past the flat, one dimensional characters, that are by the way, stunning and physically beautiful (how boring is that). Not to mention, looking past the horrible source material that is the Old Testament. I'm repulsed by the ideas that this book reinforces for women. I'm disgusted that this drivel was written by a woman. And after reading some reviews prior to recieving the book, I'm appaled that some people found this book moving, positive and uplifting. The plot device of using these characters to represent god and his unconditional love that he supposedly has for his children was weak. This was represented by the two main character's and Angel. So god talks to him(I'll leave that one alone) and tells him to marry her. He has a priest marry the two of them while she's pretty much unconsious. She runs away after being forced to work for and take care of him. I wonder why she would run away. So she finally meets a family who is willing to take care of her. She's in a good place. And then he comes back for her. She for some unknown reason, goes back to him. The worst part is the ending, because she wants nothing more than to please him and bear him a son.This book does nothing more than subjugate women. In my own opionion, so do gods and religions, but that's a different story for a differnt time. What positive message is there in this for anyone? Be a good wife and devote all your time to making babies. I think we all know there is more to life than that.Please don't waste your time reading this book, get something else that will celebrate life and the worth of an individual, or something that you will learn something from. I'll be trading mine in at the local book mine, to get something of more worth."

        "user_review": "I didn't get very far into this before realising that it was R rated. Luckily I got it free so haven't wasted any money and can happily throw it away. One of the most troubling things about this book is that there are a number of reviews from non-Christians commenting on the graphic nature of this book and stating that they wouldn't have thought the writer was a Christian. That alone explains why Christian authors need to be careful with their content, they are representing Jesus.I am aware that this is meant to be based on the book of Hosea in the Bible. However, Rivers presents her main character as a prostitute prior to her marriage...What are the moral implications of God's command for Hosea to marry a prostitute? It appears best to see Gomer as chaste at the time of marriage to Hosea, only later having become an immoral woman. The words \"take yourself a wife of harlotry\" are to be understood proleptically, i.e., looking to the future. An immoral woman could not serve as a picture of Israel coming out of Egypt (2:15; 9:10), who then later wandered away from God (11:1). Chapter 3 describes Hosea taking back his wife, who had been rejected because of adultery, a rejection that was unjustifiable if Hosea had married a prostitute with full knowledge of her character.(https://www.gty.org/library/bible-int...)The first few chapters dealt with child rape, child trafficking, brothels, drunkenness, adultery, death.....that was enough. If Rivers was trying to relay events in Hosea, I don't understand why she felt the need to include child rape and trafficking in her narrative. It just makes a tragic story even more depraved. The point of Hosea is God's love towards unfaithful Israel despite their waywardness. It is not focused on the graphic exploits of Gomer.I don't recommend this book which is full of graphic detail for shock value. For those who will no doubt comment that the book of Hosea also contains graphic scenes of a similar nature. It doesn't. The whole focus is on Israel's unfaithfulness and God's pending judgement. It is not on the details of Gomer's sin.The popularity of this book and some of the comments are representative of the \"God as love\" or some kind of \"divine romancer\" beliefs that are prevalent, as if God needs us and is desperate for us, rather than the other way around. The author writes that God says, \"Though you deny me, I love you with an everlasting love.\" That is not in line with Scripture, where God does not love with an everlasting love those who deny Him. God hates sin (and sinners) and demands obedience. Yes, God loves us and forgives us when we sin if we approach Him through trust in Jesus, but that doesn't give us a licence to sin or to presume upon His grace. Redemption (the supposed theme of this book) should lead to a complete transformation of heart and life.https://answersingenesis.org/answers/...For those seeking a cleaner read by Francine Rivers (and to prove that I'm not just being deliberately controversial) tryThe Atonement Child[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] orAnd the Shofar Blew[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] or evenThe Last Sin Eater[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...] but avoidBridge to Haven[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...].The Scarlet Threadis mediocre [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...].

Reach out and take hold, and don't let go.\"Honestly, I almost never read historical romance. It just doesn't interest me as much as contemporary does. I saw this on my libraries page and it had been recommended to me in the past, so I picked up the audiobook. I'm so glad I did. This book was fantastic and I loved it so much!This book takes place in California in the 1850's. Michael is a farmer who goes into town to sell some of his things, and that's when he sees Angel. Angel's life has been hard and even though she's young she's been through so much. She is a prostitute who has been owned by others since a young age.Michael feels called to marry Angel and even though she's resistant to the idea, eventually she comes around. Michael treats Angel well and shows her what real love and partnership is. She doesn't know how to accept this and never feels good enough, and it causes issues between them. No matter what, though, Michael never gives up on her.Redeeming Loveis, above all, a story of unconditional love. It's based on the bible story of Hosea and Gomer which is a parable of God's love for us and his willingness to always take us back, no matter what our mistakes.Angel/Sarah and Michael's love story was beautiful and I was on the edge of my seat through most of this story. I didn't know how things would turn out, but by the end I was so happy. This is a clean/inspirational romance and it gave me so many feels and had such an amazing hero and I adored it so much.Though fallen low, God raised her up, an angel."

        "user_review": "I think the purpose of this book was overshadowed by the very dark subject matter. A lot of people have called this a Christian Romance, I find that very hard to believe. The story is about a young girl sold into prostitution at the age of eight who later is rescued by a man named Michael. The books goes into shocking, disturbing detail of the sad life she led. She run's away from her devoted husband multiple times, which also got old. The whole thing was very depressing and I only continued to read hoping it would get better. I also didn't like that her husband was suppose to be so understanding yet was still sleeping with her before she even loved him or before they really had a decent relationship. If he really had respect for her and what she had been through he would have waited until she was ready. The book was way too long and way too gloomy. For the subject matter and details given, I would give it an R rating. I wish I hadn't bothered reading it."

When her brother in law drives her through the wilderness and commands her to have sex with him or he will abandon her there, he is using physical and emotional force. That is pure rape.What makes me sick is that she has to \"find forgiveness\" for this, that he never repents, that the book never recognizes rape for what it is. Especially after all the rape and systematic sexual abuse this woman grew up with.This sounds like rape in the real world, where the victim is blamed and the real sin goes unnoticed and unaddressed. It's time to wake up and call it what it is.It also deeply disturbs me that so many people read this book and do not see this sickness."

The story was riveting at first, drawing me in, so that I read the first 100 pages without even setting it aside. But I had to lay the book down to complete a task, and as I did it, I realized that I was feeling...dirty.Truly, a great deal of the book is focused on sordid and dirty details. Even after we are away from the subjects of child rape, human trafficking, auctioning of women, and seduction, it talks a great deal about nakedness and marital relations. I didn't like what I'd gotten into, frankly. I also didn't like how Michael tried to control her every thought and action in an attempt to hold onto her and not let her go.It wasn't a strict retelling of the story of Hosea, but I felt that choosing to give Michael the name of Hosea was too forced. Yes, we have him losing her three times. We don't have her doing so because of wanting to return to the life she knew. Her situation is portrayed as very bad, and instead of having Michael a bright light of God still chasing her like the hound of Heaven, we have a very flawed man not fully understanding who she is past her protective walls, a man letting her run back into independence because he labors under a misconception of what she's gone to do. This isn't an illustration of the redemptive side of marriage, where the man is to show what Christ is willing to do for the church...Michael failed her at the end. He gave up on her and stayed on his farm in discouragement, instead of chasing after her and making sure she is safe.The real, biblical Hosea kept after his wife, chasing her down and dragging her out of sin even when she made the choice to go back into it. Hosea was a picture of God reaching out to sinning Israel and dragging her back to a clean life.Sarah's story is a powerful one. I felt that it often went too far into the descriptions of what she was feeling...thus, instead of giving the facts, it presented images and drew out emotions where bare facts would have been much less sensual. We didn't have to go down into the depths to feel how revolting her life was. We didn't have to spend two chapters on her being sold at the age of eight and raped by a monster, over and over again, over the next number of years.So, in the end, it fails as an allegory; Michael doesn't chase after her quite as the real Hosea did; Sarah isn't wanting to return to a life of sensual fulfillment as Gomer was. Also, it tipped over the edge more than once into sensationalism, ending in being more like a soap opera than like a story focused only on the redemption of a soul and a lifestyle.I welcome thoughtful comments...I'm quite willing to explain my thoughts further, but don't want to spend too much time on the review."

        "user_review": "I know that this book is practically worshipped in Christian fiction circles but I there were a couple issues in it that really angered me - hence, the two star rating. If you love this book, you'll probably want to skip my review...but if you enjoy a thoughtful negative review (like me, lol)...read on!WHAT I LIKED(Thought I'd start with the positives.)-Francine Rivers is a good writer and I went through the 400+ pages of Redeeming Love rather quickly because of that.-Angel/Sarah was a good character. I liked her and wholeheartedly sympathized with her.-Miriam was also cool.-It's a retelling and retellings are (usually) awesome. I did find the fact that Michael's last name was 'Hosea' to be pretty on the nose (along with Michael drawing direct parallels between the book of Hosea and his situation. *eye roll*). But I still enjoyed the retelling aspect.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE(*cracks knuckles*)-Michael Hosea. HE ANNOYED ME TO NO END, PEOPLE. I feel like Francine Rivers put herself in Angel's shoes and then created the 'perfect' hero to sweep her off her feet. Michael was unrealistically perfect...and yet awful at the same time. For starters, I HATE how he calls Angel all sorts of different names: Mara (because she's bitter - GUESS WHY, DUDE?), Tirzah, Amanda...ugh. It was like he was trying to create a woman in his mind and kept changing her name to match his ideas of Angel. Super control freakish.Then there's the fact that he never gives Angel the benefit of the doubt (more on that in a bit) and always thinks \"she's so awful and has done such awful things\" BUT he never (as far as I can remember) adds \"but we're all sinners - including me - so I shouldn't put myself on a higher moral plain\". Ugh.-The focus on sex. Okay, I get that there's going to be quite a bit of focus on sex because Angel was a prostitute and she doesn't trust men and she hates the thought of intimacy with any man. But EVERYTHING in Michael and Angel's relationship was about the physical attraction and Michael 'manfully' restraining his lust for Angel (and then vice-versa). Yeah, yeah, Michael's constantly all \"I don't just love your good looks/gorgeous body, I love you for you\" but his actions and thoughts contradict that all the time. It got really tiring, really quickly.-Voices in the characters' heads. So, 'God' constantly talks in Michael and Angel's heads. I personally believe that God doesn't audibly talk to people ever since his Word was completed so that made me roll my eyes. But the more disturbing thing is the OTHER voices that the characters (mostly Angel) hear. Negative voices and since the positive ones are supposed to be God, I can only assume that the negative ones are demons. Or Satan himself. Which presents a whole new set of theological problems that I'm not going to get into. It's just disturbing.And then the worst thing...-SWEEPING RAPE UNDER THE RUG.Okay, let me set the scene: Michael's brother-in-law, Paul, comes to visit. He recognizes Angel as a former prostitute and freaks out. Totally looks down his nose at her. When she tries to run away, he takes her with him to drop her off at the town she used to work in. (Because he doesn't want her around Michael.) On the way, he stops the wagon and tells her that she has to pay him for the ride...and in such a way that leaves no doubt as to what kind of 'payment' he expects. Angel technically says 'okay', but in such a way that she's trying to shame him into saying no...but he goes ahead and has sex with her anyway. She believes she doesn't have a choice in the matter (and if she'd refused, he'd almost certainly have raped her). So can we just all agree that she was raped? Yes?So, Angel ends up going back to Michael. Michael figures out what happened but instead of laying into Paul, he basically ignores him. He blames Angel for what happened and doesn't even bother to get the full story from her (even though he asked her to go into great detail about other events in her life). Paul blames Angel. And Angel blames herself. There are no charges pressed against Paul and Michael doesn't even seem really mad at him (after the initial discovery).But you know what makes it even worse? A new family shows up in the area and they have this super sweet, awesome, sixteen-year-old daughter named Miriam. Angel and Michael agree that she needs a husband (this is the 1800's, so 16 wasn't too young?) and Michael says \"What about Paul?\"NO. NOT PAUL. He raped your wife and you don't even care enough to do anything about it! (Admittedly, Michael doesn't know all the details but he should have given Angel the benefit of the doubt AND laid into Paul until Paul admitted everything.) But Miriam ends up marrying Paul and even though Paul kind of repents it's still awful. He's a rapist/philanderer and I loathe him.And Michael, to be honest.So, yeah, please don't read this book."

        "user_review": "Please note: I read the Kindle version which apparently is the clean Christian version. The original paperback is what I should have read. Darn.4AngelStarsThis is a Christian based love story about a prostitute finding redemption and spirituality with her farmer husband. This book quotes a lot of scripture and the story itself is based on the Bible story of Hosea and Gomer.Set in California in the 1950's during the gold rush, Sarah is working as a high priced prostitute after years being owned since she was just eight years old. She catches the eye of a farmer named Michael. God speaks to Michael and tells him that Angel/Sarah is to be his wife. Michael sets out to wed the closed off Angel and offers her a home and freedom.\"Love cleanses, beloved. It doesn't beat you down. It doesn't cast blame. My love isn't a weapon. It's a lifeline. Reach out and take hold, and don't let go.\"Michael and Angel/Sarah were wonderful characters and their love was epic but somewhere around 78 percent the story went pretty preachy for my tastes. Nonetheless the writing was strong and it is a nice story of redemption and spiritual rebirth.\"Though fallen low, God raised her up, an angel."

        "user_review": "Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestI am not religious, so my review of this inspirational romance will be coming from the perspective of a secular reader. Our theme read in theUnapologetic Romance Readersgroup for the month of May was \"christian romance,\" and REDEEMING LOVE was actually my nomination. Francine Rivers is a name that gets bandied around a lot, not just in the christian fiction groups, but also in the historical romance groups in general. I was curious to see what she was like. As soon as I began reading this book, Iliterallyhad two people message me to inform me that this book allegedly takes two forms: the 1991 version and the 1997 version. I apparently have the 1997 version, which was edited to remove swear words and explicit love scenes to make it religion-friendly, which is definitely the case in my version. All sex scenes are very much fade-to-black, or in the case of one scene, ends with the hero and heroine soaring towards heaven - metaphorically, I'd imagine. Unless I somehow picked up a paranromal romance book without actually catching on.Sarah/Amanda/Mara/Tirzah/Angel is a prostitute who was sold into the profession against her will as a child and then raped. Over the years she has become bitter and cold; it's her only defense against her growing despair at sleeping with men she doesn't like in a prison gilded by the gold dust of the Californian mining town she's settled in. On one of her walks, Michael Hosea sees Angel and hears God tell him that this is the woman he is destined to marry. When he finds out what she is, he throws a mini-hissy before pulling up his britches and delivering Angel the news. She is not amused, and rebuffs him multiple times. When he marries her, she's actually unconscious from a beating.Much of the book is Angel learning to deal with her guilt and self-hatred. Her bitterness is exceptionally well done, and the pain she feels is warranted. The epilogue of this book is straight out of a bodice ripper, and the more I found out about her backstory - neglect, abuse, rape, assault, incest, probably PTSD - the more I sympathized with her. No matter how frustrated I felt with her as a character, I always felt that her actions were in line with her character. It takes a long time before she's able to trust Michael, and when she does, it happens in stages. She trusts him with her body and her well-being long before she's willing to let him have her heart.This story is apparently a retelling of a bible story about two people namedGomer and Hosea. I have not read the original story, so I'm not sure how accurate or true the retelling is. I will say that the story manages to stand on its own fairly well and I was engaged for the majority of the book. It was in the last quarter where I feel it begins to fail a bit, as God appears to drive Angel away from Michael because she views Michael as a god instead of Him...and he drives her right back to the man who raped and abused her, which seemed...cruel? Then one of Angel's friends tells her that she has a prayer box to remind her not to be self-sufficient, but to rely on God instead, and that whenever there's something she wants to do something about she just writes a note and puts it in the box...right. I didn't mind the way God's voice was written in this book, however, and I thought it was clever how what I assume was the devil took the voice of Angel's abuser. What better way to turn her away from the path of self-betterment than to take the voice of the man who made her feel as if she were beyond redemption in the first place? I also thought that the way the religion was written in this book is probably suitable for the time period in which it was written (1850-ish), because most people in the 19th century were religious, and it formed the backbone of their social circles in many cases.Honestly, my two biggest pet peeves were that epilogue and the fact that Paul got an HEA. The epilogue annoyed me because I felt like it wasn't realistic. I get that it was intended to be a miracle, but I really did not like it. I also really did not like Paul. He ill-treats her for 95% of the book, and then at the end of the booksheapologizes tohim. Ooh, I saw red when that happened. I kept thinking to myself, \"If this were a bodice ripper, Paul would be killed in a stampede of cows, or in a cave-in while trying to steal someone else's gold.\" But this was not a bodice ripper, so Paul accepts Angel's apology, condescends to give one of his own, and gets his stinking HEA (the bastard).In spite of its flaws, REDEEMING LOVE is a good book, and I think secular readers will be able to enjoy it too (probably more so if they can find copies of that elusive 1991 edition). I'm very glad I finally got around to reading a Francine Rivers book. She is a good writer, with a sense of characterization and pacing, and absolutely beautiful descriptions of nature. Yes, religion is a definite focal point in this book but not to the point where it's utterly preachy, either. 4/10, would read more by this author later. Her Mark of the Lion series looks especially interesting, and I'm hoping I'll be able to get a copy of that on the cheap. I love Ancient Rome.3 stars"

It was loving him in return that had brought her up out of the darkness.Wow. So much to say about this book. And I don't even know where to begin. The emotions incited were overwhelming. My chest still hurts from the feelings I have. I must say, I don't cry often when I read. And when I do, it is more often out of sorrow and pain. But this book made me cry out of sheer joy. It chokes me up still to think about it. Very inspiring read.This story follows the life of a girl who has believed from her earliest memories that she was a mistake. Not meant to be born. A burden to everyone she encountered.And as she grew up, her beliefs were reinforced time and time again. She lost any hope she had of love and happiness in her life. She'd had to trade those frivolous needs for mere survival. And she knew deep down to the bottom of her soul that those things were not meant for her.[image error]All they saw was her beauty, a flawless veil wrapped around a frozen heart, and they were enthralled. They looked into her angel eyes and were lost.It was the 1850's, and the California gold rush was in full swing. And it wasn't long before Angel found herself in the midst of chaos.Enduring the ship alone to get there was enough to take her sanity. The freedom she thought she would find upon her arrival had quickly turned into a fight to survive. Penniless and alone, she was quickly drawn right back into the life she had tried so hard to escape.There was no freedom. There was no happiness. Not for her. Not ever. But then something happened. And his name was Michael Hosea.Now this was a man who was told by God, that he should marry Angel and deliver her from her bondage. But Angel wasn't buying it. The more he tried to convince her, the more convinced she was of his insincerity.What was it about this man that got to her? She preferred the numbness to this stirring of emotion. Hope was torment. Hope was an enemy. And this man was a thorn in her side.Until fate eventually gives her up to him, just like she knew it would… but she wouldn't go easily.She was the blackest night, and he the starlight piercing it, creating an unfolding pattern in her life.This book was a struggle for one woman to overcome the power of her own self worth. And in a way, it proved that although food and water are needed to nourish our bodies, they may not be as important to our survival as faith and hope and trust.She stared at those aristocratic hands, hands without calluses, pale and manicured. Beautifully shaped hands that were capable of unspeakable cruelty.She remembered Michael's hands, large and strong, clearly used to hard labor. They were callused and rough. His hands had looked so cruel and yet been so gentle. His touch had healed her body and opened her heart.I don't want to say much more. I will say though that this one will go straight to my favorites list. I'm sorry, I know this review is lacking in so many ways… but the book is definitely not. I will leave you with a few quotes, and photos, and my updates photos as well.I cannot recommend this one enough.BTW... my update photos are better. ;)"

        "user_review": "Redeeming Loveby Francine Rivers has undeniably earned a coveted spot on my top bookshelf of classically flawless stories. This is a book that I will probably find myself reading over and over again until it simply falls apart at the seams. Such a beautiful love story that I could not separate myself from both mentally and emotionally.I read this book while I was traveling, and I truly don't know how I made my connector flights or found my departing gate terminals, or even who sat next to me on the airplane. Forget all the flight instructions about cabin pressure, oxygen masks and floating devices, I was lost in my book as I was more concerned about the turbulence in Michael and Angel's life and their ultimate destination than anything I was experiencing at the moment. I think I must have sighed a hundred times from heartbreak and angst for these characters and forget about keeping track of my facial expressions, but I treasured every moment irregardless of what people around me must have witnessed.First off, one thing I must note about this book, and it's probably the one small element that held me off from reading it sooner than I did, or reading it at all for that matter. The book is categorized asContemporary Christian Fictionas it's based on the biblical story ofHosea and Gomer. Wait!! Don't let that turn you off just yet. Just give me a few more moments to share its fabulousness; I swear I'm not a religious fanatic (See?? I'm swearing!). But before I move on let me explain my reading preferences.I pick up books for fictional journeys, normally young adult, paranormal, and dystopian. For me to pick up a book with a religious/spiritual tone, well… let's just say I'd never think that would happen, and I'm just being honest. Secondly, I'd be lying if I called myself a devout anything… Christian or Catholic. Nope, that's not me… the devout part that is... so when the situation feels preachy, I get uncomfortable. I'm not saying I have absolutely no faith… not the case at all. I just wouldn't normally read a book about religion, faith or spirituality. And, I'm not going to feel guilty about that because God and I have our private convos, and let's just say… we're good. Okay, so keeping that in mind, I still picked up this book and I was wowed… Not in a spiritual sense mind you. It was more like it showed me how when you really love someone, you're willing to sacrifice a piece of yourself and forgive your partner's grievances no matter how much it might hurt sometimes. I saw it from more of an emotional perspective rather than a spiritual sense. So if I missed the mark… oh well… it was mine to miss.Overall, this book does a masterful job of blending love and betrayal, hope and despair, self-destruction and ultimate redemption. I fell in love with these characters as Michael and Angel experienced a turbulent journey towards trust, hope, love and ultimate faith. Michael Hosea was the true angel in this story for the number of times he forgave Angel's transgressions and painful, ongoing betrayal. He was such a gentle and trusting soul and just an all around, too good to be true person. His faith in God and his belief in his purpose as dictated by a higher being were heartfelt and poignant. As for Angel, for all of the mistakes and sins she committed, I still held a soft spot for her and cared for her character deeply, and that never wavered. My heart broke when her back-story was revealed, and I read about how she was betrayed, destroyed and used. No matter how awful her choices were and how badly they hurt Michael, I still wanted to come to her defenses. What an emotional ride!Another thing I want to share about this book. It has one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever read. There is a part in the story, right after Angel betrays and abandons Michael (and not for the first or last time) that he takes her to an unknown destination. She is frightened that he'll hurt her as punishment, and their journey through the dark forest to get where they were going was intense. He ultimately leads them to the crest of a mountain and he points to the moon… yes, that ball of cheese in the sky, and he holds her tightly. After resisting him for some time, she finally stops to look at the beauty around her as the hours pass, the moon descends and the sun begins to set. He doesn't say much, but he shows her the hope held in the renewal of a new day and the absolute beauty around you if you just stop to look and listen, rather than destroy it or pretend it doesn't exist; and he simply tells her, \"This is the life I want to give you.\" *tear...sob*Am I a total sap if I admit it reminds me of the songMoonlight? Noooo, not the Barry Manilow version… more like the Jason Castro rendition. :) So for me to quote a sappy love song, you know I was moved by this book! Gah!!! *head desk*I've been pegged as being a sucker for melodramic love stories. Well, I'm good with that and willing to own it because it's books likeRedeeming Lovethat remind me some of them are just worth it. Absolutely worth it! There are some books you want to convince everyone to read and then there are some that you want to keep to yourself because you'll be disappointed if someone bashes to pieces something you just absolutely adore. I'll tell you right now, I loved this book, but if it doesn't gain traction by many, I'll feel comforted that it's safe and treasured on my bookshelf.Now here are the lyrics to Moonlight and I'll just end with that. :)Midnight, not a sound from the pavementHas the moon lost her memory, she is smiling aloneIn the lamplight, the withered leaves, collected my feetAnd the wind begins to moanMemory, all alone in the moonlightI can smile at the old days, it was beautiful thenI remember the time I knew what happiness wasLet the memory live againDaylight, I must wait for the sunriseI must think of a new life, and I mustn't give inWhen the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory, tooAnd a new day will beginBurnt out ends of smoky days, the stale cold smell of morningThe street lamp dies, another night is over, another day is dawningTouch me, it's so easy to leave me, all alone with the memory of my day in the sunIf you touch me, you'll understand what happiness isLook a new day, has begun*sniffle... sniffle... tear... tear*"

        "user_review": "This is a difficult book to rate because at times it's a 1 and then a 3 and I can even see how readers could give it a 5 star rating. It's an inspirational romance that at times is quite heavy on the religious aspect in my opinion. If the idea of a kind of self-sacrifice to the extreme that doesn't seem to benefit anyone apart from God (but even then that's debatable) appeals to you, then you'll probably like this book. I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I could appreciate it.It's not the greatest writing in the world. It's very simple in style and reminded me of something like the Good News Bible where Biblical verse is written in a more modern, accessible way with a simplistic approach to what is otherwise complicated religious dogma when you really look at it. The relationship between the two frontier families is a bit too utopian but fits in with this striving-to-be- like-God ideal and there's nothing wrong with that, but I think you have to like reading about that sort of \"wholesomeness\". There's a note from the publisher that says it's a PG 13 novel and maybe for people who read inspirational romances it is but I didn't think so. There was one very brief disgusting scene but given the situation and the period I thought that was misleading to brand it PG 13. There is virtually no physical intimacy in this book, apart from the odd kiss, and any sex is glossed over leaving you wondering if they had sex or not. The violence in the novel is treated the same way and I think it's a disservice not to \"show\" the reader what the author is seeing. You get these one liners about horrific beatings, great sex on a very spiritual level but no detail. The author shows a lot about God but not enough about the h/h together as a married couple. Emotional, spiritual and physical intimacy make for better rounded characters I think and I felt short changed not to get all that. The book could probably be a good 4 ½ stars if this aspect of the writing had been developed.The hero and the heroine are very well-drawn. Michael is a true saint and if you took away his devout belief in God he'd make one of the best romance heroes around. He gets kicked in the teeth so many times but he still keeps coming back for more. He reminded me of poor Job at times. His self-sacrifice skirts the incredulous and I still can't see what he got out of it during those years of waiting. His character's endless patience reminds me of Sarah McCarty's Asa inPromises Linger. As for Angel/Sarah, she is such an irritating/stupid woman. She has heaven in hand and she keeps throwing it away. Her life is a nightmare and it's a wonder she never killed herself to get out of it, but I had a hard time understanding that after so much unconditional love from Michael that she felt too she ended up leaving him.It was difficult to believe all this love at first sight and God speaking to these people in mysterious ways. It's the Old Testament mysterious mean God in this story at times who takes everything away and you get to live in emotional hell. Why I don't know and that's what I really didn't like about this book from a romance perspective. Michael's a good guy why keep testing him? Angel has been through hell and back why have her leave her haven incessantly? I guess you could say that they both had things to do first before they could be together but I think they really wasted some very valuable time that they could've been better spent together.The epilogue is quite moving and God finally decides to give something back apart from just his love which is supposed to be the true reason for living, but I didn't really see what kind of happiness it brought these people because without each other they were horribly sad and lost.If you take the novel as a retelling of the Book Hosea(what little I know about it) it's pretty good, but if you read it as a romance you may be disappointed. So two stars for romance, four for the retelling of the Book of Hosea for me.FYI: If devout believers who see God in everything as well as true faith being the only way to find happiness in life bother you, you may want to pass on this book."

I tried so hard not to cry (especially toward the end) but I finally had to pull over and wipe my eyes when it ended. So much grief, redemption and joy. A fantastic story that drew me in and kept me glued.Its a historical romance set in mid 1800's gold country region of California. Angel is a damaged young woman working a brothel and struggling with many horrors from her past. Michael is a devout Christian who believes God wants him to marry Angel - a soiled dove.Apparently this is a retelling of a bible story. I think this may be only the second Christian themed novel I've ever read, which means its the first one I ever finished. While it was very inspirational it refrained from being preachy.Its not a light read, and at times was even depressing. But the writing was so spot on and the characters so real I couldn't stop. And it does end with a great ending. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to crawl into the book to talk with Angel, hug Michael, slap his brother, kill a bad guy, shelter a person down on their luck...etc. I can see why it has such high ratings by sooooo many people. But my next book will be a light read. I don't think I could take two books like this in a row!"

        "user_review": "Okay, before getting too far into reading this, understand that I only read this book because it was required of me for a book club. I wouldn't normally review something I felt this unkind towards because I would not finish it. Nor would I expect to like it.Fair warning.Redeeming Love is a part of the genre we like to call \"Inspirational Fiction\" where the word \"Inspirational\" is a more friendly and inclusive way to say \"Jesus-y\" or \"religious\" or, as I like to say it, \"Jesus C fiction where the \"C\" stands for \"Centric\" AND \"Christ.\"And in this case, I don't mean that Jesus is an important figure in the characters' lives or that their belief system informs their decisions. I mean that god literally speaks to the characters. In case you're wondering, god's words are differentiated by being in bold. On the plus, you can just flip through and still catch most of the god stuff. I kind of feel like god would have the graphic design sense to have his own font, but what do I know?To briefly summarize, Angel is a prostitute, and Michael is pretty much the best guy ever who comes along and hears god's voice telling him to marry Angel, which he does. They go back and forth a bit, she leaves him three times and bangs his brother, Paul, on the side of the road. A family traveling to Oregon comes across their land at one point, and Michael invites them to live on the land with them. They have children who Angel likes, and that brings ups the fact that Angel has undergone some sort of barroom hysterectomy, which apparently didn't take because the epilogue explains that she inexplicably has kids anyway, Paul marries one of the cross-country travelers after he and Angel make peace, and all accept god as being The Man.I can sort of understand the appeal of this book in some ways. It's compulsively readable in the sense that you can read 100 pages in a sitting, easily. Lots of stuff happens, and there's a pacing to it that keeps it all moving.But aside from that, I really have a problem with a lot of what this books sees as love.For starters, if there was a god who literally spoke to me and told me that a particular person was \"the one\" that would simplify things quite a bit. Seriously, if god used his god-to-brain telephone to let me know that someone crazy, Courtney Love let's say, was the one, then I'd really have no choice but to pursue that person because nobody else would make me equally happy. I probably wouldn't wait until a pimp beat the holy bejeezus out of her to make my move and ask her to marry me the way Michael did in the book, but I'm just saying the path is a little clearer-cut.But life isn't that easy. It's really not, and perhaps Courtney Love is the one for me, but I don't suspect that she is, and therefore I won't be busting my ass to try and convince her that a Derk/Love wedding is the ultimate fulfillment of god's plan. If it were, the good news is that we could at least all come together on the fact that good is crazy and has very bad taste in Fleetwood Mac covers.One of the unfortunate, difficult things about love is that there will always be uncertainty. I've talked to people who have been with lots of partners, and they're never sure. I've talked to people who married the only person they've ever dated, and there's uncertainty there too. I'm not saying it's the kind of uncertainty that causes infidelity or wandering or whatever, but part of loving one person exclusively is accepting a certain level of doubt and learning how to put that aside or work through it. Or spending a lot on flowers and tennis bracelets.The one kind of person I've never talked to is the kind that says god literally told him or her, in an audible voice, who \"the one\" was.So if god tells you directly that California's hottest prostitute is the one, I would highly suggest getting a second opinion. St. Francis maybe? Is that a guy?Now, I don't know enough about the romance genre to say whether this is endemic within it, but I have seen my fair share of romantic comedies, and there is a sort of love narrative that I don't approve of.A lot of romcoms push the assumption that Person A can love Person B so much that it doesn't really matter that Person B doesn't love Person A. And in the romcom world, it is acceptable to pursue someone with a naked aggression that would never be acceptable in real life.Imagine some of the things that people do in romcoms to show their love. If someone came sprinting through Manhattan traffic to catch you on the other side of the street, wouldn't you question his sanity? If you caught a woman peeping into your house from a position in a high-up tree branch, wouldn't you consider updating your security system to include some sort of lasers or robotic dogs? If Lloyd Dobler was playing a boombox outside your window, would that really change your feelings about him? (actually the correct answer to that one is \"No\" but only because you loved Lloyd Dobler immediately and always)The point is, I don't belive in loving someone so much that they eventually love you, and maybe some couples end up together because one person engaged in an untiring pursuit, but I would think it's very rare that several rejections end with an equally shared love. Wearing someone out to the point that it's easier to say Yes than No is not really the same as making them love you. It'll do in a pinch, and if you're a lot better at being annoying than charming it's worth a shot, but overall it's not the best plan.Let's talk about characters for a minute.Michael, the main guy, couldn't me more flat if he were digitally rendered for the Atari 2600. All this guy does is listen to god, and then forgive his wife for everything. Relationships have to be about forgiveness to some extent, but I don't think you should forgive your wife for banging your brother on the side of the road for no apparent reason. Or your brother, for that matter (unless, as we discussed earlier, your brother happens to be Lloyd Dobler, in which case who can blame them?). I mean, if my brother banged my wife, I think this would warrant, bare minimum, a heated discussion over a dinner that I don't even finish because I'm too busy being mad at my brother and wife equally.There is somethig about this Michael character that we are supposed to see as very strong, but to me comes off as the worst kind of weak. His entire purpose in the book, the entire scope of his life, is putting up with a woman who takes a very long time to actually love him. He apparently has nothing in his life and is a simple, empty vessel waiting for the right woman to come along and not only make him complete, but be his Wizard of Oz and give him brains and a heart and whatever the hell else those other losers got.This character is a bad example for men and women alike. Men should not strive to be like him because his forgiveness extends so far that it would make any real person extremely unhappy. Also, following his example means living a life that is devoid of purpose outside of having a romantic relationship, which means you are an empty, soulless person, and good luck attracting someone else if you have no interests, no passions, and nothing about yourself that you've built or cultivated.He has no personality, nothing that sets him apart from other men other than he's on the \"good\" side of the line that ALL characters in this book could be categorized by. Seriously, this really is like an Atari game in that you could easily divide the characters into two camps: good guys and bad guys.Through the lens of Angel, we discover that there are two kinds of men in the world: sex-crazed maniac murderers, and the nicest guys ever who still only vaguely manage to suppress their sexual urges through a close relationship with god. Basically, all men in the book are tormented by their relationship with sex, and it's all about whether or not they \"give in.\" Even with a spouse, there's some sex that's okay and some sex that's not okay because it's \"giving in.\"What a terrible way to look at the world. I personally believe there are many men out there who have healthy relationships with sex. Lord knows I'm not one of them, as my internet browsing history could easily confirm, but I strongly believe that those men exist, and I also think there are men who struggle with sex without forcing their struggles on others. Sex or sexual desire can be something a man wrestles with a little without becoming a crazed sex maniac who bangs his brother's wife on the side of the road. I'm really obsessed with that, in case you can't tell.The author doesn't understand men at all. If you think the ideal man is an empty vessel waiting to be filled, then buy a blowup doll and whisper your prayers into it every night until he's full. Then wish for him to be a real boy and see how far that gets you.And what about Angel, the female lead?Ah, the hooker with a heart of gold.The idea of the hooker with a heart of gold is very odd to me because it makes some very unfair assumptions. First, why would we assume that someone who has sex for money does not have a good heart? Why would our default assumption be that this person is heartless and mean as opposed to having a good heart? Why is this the only profession that we hear this about? When someone says their husband works at a grocery store, they don't throw in, \"but he has a heart of gold.\" I've never heard of a baker with a heart of gold. And flipside, if these gold-hearted hookers are such an anomoly, how come I never read stories about hookers with hearts of wet garbage, or hearts of heart meat that perform their functions adequately if a bit coldly?I do have a great idea for a steampunk novel called Hooker with a Heart of Gold about...well, exactly what it sounds like. And somehow the mechanical heart gives her fuck powers. I haven't worked out all the details yet, but I suspect the end involves her 40 years later living in a small cabin, the one bullet she stopped still lodged in her golden heart. If only she'd been able to stop the other...Anyway, I thought I would have more to say about Angel, but she's just as empty as Michael. She's empty in a different way in that she seems like a self-contained unit piloting her way through the novel, going whichever way she is steered by the various characters. At least she had a career of sorts so she wasn't totally empty. And I didn't mean that as a hooker pun, but once you start denying hooker puns you've already kind of lost the battle.The most redemptive part of the book is the idea that Michael is constantly forgiving Angel for her past. I suppose that's a somewhat enlightened view of things, and I wouldn't expect that many men of god living during the gold rush would be too excited at the prospect of making a hooker into a wife. Warts and all. LOTS of warts and all.But, the book loses touch with reality because it's not about recognizing the past as something that has shaped a person into the person you love today. It's about getting over the past, hitting the reset button and starting a new life, which doesn't even work in the book because everything is thrown into total disarray everytime the past comes up, which it certainly will.As an adult, you do have to reconcile with the past, both your own and your partner's. You have to recognize that the past shaped the person you're with today, and that's the person you love, so for better or worse things have sort of worked out.What the book doesn't make clear is that you also have to balance the past. Yes, I think it's good that Michael can make peace with the fact that his wife was a hooker. I mean, it's a little easier to do and really doesn't bring up a lot of the core issues because she had no choice in the matter, but nevertheless, he didn't seem terribly judgmental of her past. But if your wife brings up the fact that she had sex with her own father in a revenge scenario, that's a huge red flag. If someone is angry enough at their own father, or confused enough or whatever, that when he walks into a brothel she has sex with him, it doesn't really matter how cool YOU are with her past because she obviously still has some stuff to work out there.I don't know what kind of love people of the world are looking for. But I hope this isn't it. If you are expecting this story to match your own, I am very sad for you because I don't have very high hopes. I wish you the best of luck, however, and try not to fuck anyone's brother or your own father and you'll already be going down a better path."

It pops up from time to time on friends' feeds, and with over 70,000 Goodreads ratings and over 1,600 Amazon ratings, I'd say it is a pretty popular book. When I saw this come up on NetGalley, I was hesitant to give this a try. However, the Kindle book costs $9.99, so I figured this was my only shot to see what all the fuss was about. I asked a few GR friends if they thought that this book was appropriate for someone who isn't Christian or religious, and they all said yes, that it was more of an uplifting love story than anything else.I have to respectfully say that they were wrong.This book is very heavy on the religious themes. There is a case of insta-love (as dictated by Jesus) and God saving a woman from a life of despair and prostitution.The theme of the story is based on the Book of Hosea from the Bible, where God told the prophet, Hosea to marry a prostitute.\"Go marry a prostitute and have children with her.\"I can see how people who have a religious background and like the idea of Jesus leading them to their soul-mate would love this book. It is a love and God conquers all type of story. However, religious content aside, this book is just not my speed. The beginning of this book is actually very sad and depressing. It features child abuse and neglect, all of which I dislike reading about. Also, technically speaking, I wasn't too impressed with the writing style. It often dove into the realm of \"cheesy\" and \"eye-roll-inducing\". Besides, the insta-love is annoying in any setting.I won't do a long, picky review of this book. I didn't finish it and I'm not rating it because I recognize that I am not the target audience for this story. Despite what people might say,this is 100% a Christian book and should be read only by those that enjoy religious fiction.I'm glad that many of my friends have loved this one but this certainly isn't for me.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**"

        "user_review": "Well, I only have myself to blame for this one. Actually, myself and all the rave reviews on Goodreads saying this was such a moving, inspirational book. Now that I've finished it, I'm left wondering what exactly should have inspired me about it. As a reader I didn't like this book. As a woman -- I loathed it.Maybe in some alternate reality I could have gotten over the poor writing style, the one-dimensional characters, their often irrational behavior, perhaps, though I doubt it, even over the fact that God actually speaks in this book, I cannot and will not get over the crap Angel was put through because she was a woman. The double standards for men and women is something that pisses me off all the time, and here I almost wanted to burn the damn book. Why, you might ask. The part of the book that made me hate it is the part where Paul, Michael's brother-in-law made Angel have sex with him as payment for letting her travel with him. I admit, I wanted Angel to at least argue with him, but nevertheless, he was a disgusting son of a bitch that asked it, and then did it. What a decent human being that really has the moral high ground when it comes to prostitutes. I believe the little sleezeball was just pissed that he was never a good enough client to even get to Angel. When I find prostitution like this in a book, I feel sorry for the prostitute. I especially felt bad for Angel. She was forced into it by a pedophile when she was only eight years old. For her, I had sympathy, but for those men that came to her, I only had contempt. Paul -- I despised that man with all my might. And if forcing Angel to have sex with him wasn't bad enough, when she ultimately came back to Michael, he still treated her as garbage. He showed his hatred towards her every chance he got. Hey, Paul, I've got news for you! You're garbage! You're despicable! If you think prostitutes are that filthy and unworthy, well, guess what, you went to them, so you're much, much worse!And Michael was behaving like nothing happened. All forgiven. I don't know... I'd expect my loving, protective husband to kill the bastard, or at least beat the crap out of him, and never speak to him again. But that's just me. Oh, that's not all. Angel spent the whole time blaming herself, trying to redeem herself, justifying Paul. In the end, she actually apologized to him. What the fuck was that all about?! I was reading it, and I couldn't believe it. It's okay to rape a prostitute? Is that it? She had it coming? Putting the blame on the victim is something I can't stand. The way almost every man in Angel's life treated her, she should have shot them all.I also hated the fact Angel's past was showed as her sin. She was abused in every way for at least ten years. I know there weren't any psychologists there, but for God's sake talk to her, help her, don't ignore it, and pretend it never happened. The victim of such abuse needs therapy, not forgiveness for something they were forced into.In the long list of my problems with this book was also the part where Angel said the purpose of a woman's life is to bear children. Okay, having children if you want them is all great, but are we really implying that women who can't have children, or perhaps end up with men who can't, have meaningless lives?And sure, even though Angel couldn't have children, she ended up having them because I guess God reversed whatever that \"doctor\" did to her to make sure she never got pregnant again.I've mentioned at the beginning some of the other things that bothered me while reading. I haven't got the energy to go into them, though they bothered me a lot. But, never mind, I'm just glad I'm done with this book, and that now I know never ever to pick this type of book again."

        "user_review": "What About the Children?The Readeris a profound exposition of the 'second generation' issues concerning moral guilt for the Holocaust. But it is, I think, also relevant more generally to the way in which human beings get ensnared incrementally into the evils of their society. We are all inevitably involved in this larger problem. And, like the SS guards at a Nazi death camp, we are unaware of the moral peril of our situation, and unwilling to remove ourselves from that situation even when its harmful effects are obvious.To be more personal and concrete: At the moment I have three acquaintances, each of whom has had a reasonably successful corporate career - one as an investment manager in the City, the second as a senior executive of an international sporting organisation, and the third as a partner of a global accounting firm. All three are, however, deeply dissatisfied with their lives.Their marriages, they all feel, are on the edge of breakdown. One has had a psychological breakdown and is now institutionalised. Another has been made redundant and, despite a large payout, sees nothing but existential gloom for the rest of his days. The last is disgusted with the complete indifference of both his colleagues and clients to the visible harm their firms are inflicting on the world. All of them, it shouldn't be necessary to emphasise, 'volunteered' for the careers and styles of living they now suffer from.A central question posed toThe Reader's defendant in her trial for causing the death of Jewish prisoners trapped in a burning church is, \"Why didn't you unlock the door?\" I posed essentially the same question to my three acquaintances: \"The situation you now find yourself in did not occur overnight.\" I gently suggested, \"Therefore as you perceived what was happening to your mind, to your family, to the quality of your life, to national culture, why didn't you stop?\" In principle, stopping is even less difficult than unlocking a door.The reasons given for not stopping were almost identical in all three cases: \"I can't afford to.\" The financial denotation of 'afford', however, wasn't the main point. Guilt in not providing what their families needed was important. Financial compensation had become just that - compensation for the companionship of marriage and family that had been denied. This was associated with a fear of the disappointment or disapproval by their friends and family. Success is naturally a social matter defined for us by those we know well. But upon pushing a bit harder, it was also clear that the common strand among them was that each believed he had somehow let himself down by not realising the full potential he believed he had in him.This psychic driver of \"being the best you can\" struck loud bells in my own experience. It also reminded me of the remarkable book by Karen Ho, a social researcher from Princeton. Her ethnographic study of the life and culture of Wall Street,Liquidated, is as insightful as it is troublesome to anyone who asks themselves why indeed they have not simply unlocked the door to an alternative life. As she discovered in her employment in an investment bank, the culture of professional firms like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company is grounded in a simple, direct message: \"You are here (or want to be here in the case of applicants) because you are the best and want to be among the best.\" Call it the Culture of Presumptive Excellence (CPE) for short.CPE is what stimulates people to work consistently impossible hours, in places distant from home, with no respite. It also justifies the treatment of subordinates as corporate fodder, hiring and firing with panache, and insisting on single-minded loyalty as one moves up the ranks. Standards of excellence, after all, do not maintain themselves. In my experience, CPE, not compensation, or excitement, or 'perks', is the motive force of not just Wall Street but of the entire global corporate world. Escaping that world is no easier than escaping the totalitarian society of Nazi Germany. The identity and the obligations of 'being the best' is a very powerful lock indeed, without any obvious key.Of course CPE is not merely a corporate problem; it is a societal problem. It is a problem of the perceived order. Schlink's war-trial defendant, Hanna, did not unlock the doors of the church to let the prisoners out, not because she is evil or because she was following orders. She was afraid, she says, of the disorder that would have ensued: prisoners running amok without the proper supervision to get them back in marching line.It is this same disorder that my three acquaintances seem to fear most. The problem with being 'the best' is that the criterion for being best has to be set by someone with authority. The self-identity of the best depends on this. To reject this classification and the criteria that define it, one also must reject the authority that sanctioned it. This authority is so diffuse throughout society, that to reject it means to reject the entire society. The loss of both identity and context for establishing a new identity is the ultimate disorder, chaos.Jean Korelitz, for example, herself a former admissions officer for Princeton, shows how pervasive the CPE is in the steps before entering the corporate world in her novel,Admission. Princeton's 'pitch' to applicants is exactly the same as that of the Wall Street firms to its applicants: \"As the best, you will want to stay among the best, so apply to Princeton.\" The stage before this, entry into prep school, is also fictionalised from experience, in turn, by Louis Auchincloss, particularly in his novel,The Rector of Justin. The message doesn't vary: \"We are the best and will help you stay among the best.\"The destruction of personalities, families, and culture by CPE is systematic. And it is systematically defended even by those whom it excludes. The effects of CPE extend beyond those who are certifiably, as it were, the best to those who aspire to become part of the elite. Deficiencies are masked by the aspiration itself, which is merely the acceptance of the defining authority.InThe Reader, Hanna is able to hide her secret shame by joining the SS, an elite corps. I can say with a moral certainty that all three of my acquaintances have what are, to them, equivalent to Hanna's secret deficiencies. Fear of exposure is therefore a powerful motivation to keep the system going, to promote its stable orderliness even when it is so evidently destructive.Schlink's narrator, Michael Berg, knows that Hanna could not have committed the crimes she is accused of because of the secret she is unwilling to reveal. She may be guilty but not as guilty as she appears, or of what she is charged with. What duty does he have to unlock the door with which she has imprisoned herself? To speak up, either to her or the court, would expose her to profound shame, greater shame even than that of being found guilty of war crimes perhaps. And if he does decide to speak up, how should he do it - to her? To her lawyer? To the judge? I feel the same dilemmas in advising my acquaintances, knowing that any mis-step could provoke yet more consternation as well as a pointed lack of gratitude for my solicited but still impertinent advice.Berg's father, a philosopher, advises a simple ethical rule: don't try to second guess the criterion of the good that an individual has established for himself. This is useless advice. It simply anoints conformity as the ethical norm. Conformity is the opposite of resistance, a capacity for which is essential to avoid personal co-optation, to either totalitarianism or corporatism. Resistance which can take many forms. All of them dangerous because they challenge order and the power behind order. And all demand apparently un-virtuous behaviour. How can one advise such a course to anyone one cares about? Ultimately Berg fails to act at all.I find myself in Berg's position. I feel any advice I can give is vapid. To suggest resistance against a corporate culture that is so pervasive and so domineering is madness. I can only ask the question \"Best is the superlative for what?\" But I can't answer the question. I am as trapped as anyone else. Will the children of my acquaintances, or my own, look at the lives of their parents with the same dismay as the so-called second generation of German children perceived their parents after 1945?Schlink's story ends in tragic sadness and unresolved guilt. Perhaps no other ending is possible."

        "user_review": "Der Vorleser = The Reader, Bernhard SchlinkThe Reader is a novel by German law professor and judge Bernhard Schlink, published in Germany in 1995.The story is told in three parts by the main character, Michael Berg. Each part takes place in a different time period in the past.Spoiler AlertPart Ibegins in a West German city in 1958. After 15-year-old Michael becomes ill on his way home, 36-year-old tram conductor Hanna Schmitz notices him, cleans him up, and sees him safely home. He spends the next three months absent from school battling hepatitis. ...Part 2, Six years later, while attending law school, Michael is part of a group of students observing a war crimes trial. A group of middle-aged women who had served as SS guards at a satellite of Auschwitz in occupied Poland are being tried for allowing 300 Jewish women under their ostensible \"protection\" to die in a fire locked in a church that had been bombed during the evacuation of the camp. The incident was chronicled in a book written by one of the few survivors, who emigrated to the United States after the war; she is the main prosecution witness at the trial. ...Part 3, Years have passed, Michael is divorced and has a daughter from his brief marriage. He is trying to come to terms with his feelings for Hanna, and begins taping readings of books and sending them to her without any correspondence while she is in prison.Hanna begins to teach herself to read, and then write in a childlike way, by borrowing the books from the prison library and following the tapes along in the text.She writes to Michael, but he cannot bring himself to reply. After 18 years, Hanna is about to be released, so he agrees (after hesitation) to find her a place to stay and employment, visiting her in prison.On the day of her release in 1983, she commits suicide and Michael is heartbroken. Michael learns from the warden that she had been reading books by many prominent Holocaust survivors, such as Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski, and histories of the camps.The warden, in her anger towards Michael for communicating with Hanna only by audio tapes, expresses Hanna's disappointment. Hanna left him an assignment: give all her money to the survivor of the church fire.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «برايم كتاب بخوان»؛ «کتابخوان»؛ نویسنده: برنهارد شلینک؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز نوزدهم ماه فوریه سال2004میلا��یعنوان: برايم كتاب بخوان؛ نویسنده: برنهارد شلینک؛ مترجم بهمندخت اویسی؛ تهران، نشر فرزان، 1381؛ در سیزده و 239ص؛ شابک9643211703؛ چاپ دیگر با عنوان کتابخوان؛ تهران، نشر تاریخ ایران، 1388، در 204ص؛ شابک 9789646082755؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان آلمان - سده 20مداستان در سال 1958میلادی در آلمان آغاز می‌شود؛ «میشائیل»، نوجوان پانزده ساله، بطور اتفاقی، با زنی به نام «هانا»، آشنا و به او علاقمند می‌شود؛ «هانا» هر بار که «میشائیل» نزد او می‌رود، او را وادار می‌کند، تا برایش با صدای بلند کتاب بخواند؛ «میشائیل» روزی متوجه می‌شود، که «هانا» بدون آنکه نشانی از خود برجای بگذارد، شهر را ترک کرده است؛ سال‌ها می‌گذرد، و «میشائیل» بزرگ می‌شود؛ او در رشته ‌ی حقوق تحصیل می‌کند، و روزی، در یکی از دادگاه‌ هایی که برای مجازات جنایتکاران جنگ جهانی دوم برپا ‌شده، «هانا» را می‌یابد؛ «هانا» در جایگاه متهمان قرار گرفته، و شواهد بر این دلالت دارند، که او در زمان جنگ، نگهبان زندانیانی بوده است، که به شکل وحشیانه ‌ای قتل‌عام شده ‌اند …؛ با اقتباس از این داستان فیلمی نیز به همین نام ساخته شده است؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 18/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 28/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "On my last-minute whim,I grabbed,a story of an erotic love affair betweena 15-year-old German boy, Michael Berg,and 35-year-old, Hanna Schmitz!Suffering from hepatitis and Hanna nurturing him,In due course both develop passionate feelings for each other.They keep their relationship under wraps.He would read out to her, and not vice-versa (avoiding spoilers, on why?)Eventually, as Michael matures, the relationship starts dwindling,Hanna disappears into thin air!Destiny bestows a second encounter between the two,but in vexatious circumstances.He is a law student, and Hanna is on a trial as an SS concentration camp guard,with numerous deaths charged against her during the bombing!What follows is all circled around discovering whether Hanna is guilty and be incarcerated,or is innocent (avoiding spoilers)?The biggest remnant-He couldn't love anyone other than Hanna!My Views-Originally published in German, I found the English translation to be weak, thin, sporadic, and sparse, and it couldn't endow an awe-inspiring feeling to me! I just couldn't stay riveted, irrespective of the compelling plot premise. ☹Not to mention, the novel got numerous accolades and raving terrific reviews, but this may sound like an outlier.I was attracted due to the premisearound WWII (the holocaust era) and an unwonted love story weaving in the backdrop, between two individuals from totally different backgrounds and a stark age difference.But honestly, I remained neutral. It didn't arouse any feelings in me, I couldn't marry the characters, and found them scattered and weak!The biggest takeaway for me was the fact literacy is a massive accomplishment, and can never be compromised!The entire narration is from Michael's point of view, and I am sure the original German text must have done justice to the brilliant plot premise, and so acquired raving positive reviews.But the English translationjust faltered for me, and made my reading experience insipid and banal!I just couldn't wed the plot, due to the sporadicity.Without any further belaboring, I close the review, by giving arespectful 3 stars!NB- Resonating with writing style/translation is a subjective topic, and request people not to take the rating universally. It is strictly my point-of-view, and request readers to explore this short book, with a marvelous plot-line! :) It is my behove, to be honest with my views and rating, and try to do the same with all my reviews."

        "user_review": "I have the feeling there's more than one way of looking at this book. On one hand it can be viewed as abildungsroman, it follows Michael Berg since the age of 15 till full maturity. On the other hand, it's the post-war German generation coming to terms with their past, the Nazi crimes and their parents' guilt. Guilt, actually, is a recurring theme in the novel: Hanna is guilty of war crimes, Michael is guilty for betrayal (plus he feels guilty for having loved Hanna and asks himself if that makes him a criminal as well), Michael's father for not being enough of a father.The question you get stuck with, after reading, is Hanna's question addressed to the judge: \"What would you have done?\"The question I am stuck with is: What would have happened if the truth had been told?On a bohemian level, the novel is about love for books and reading, so that's a plus for bookworms :)"

        "user_review": "I'm not really sure why this book is considered one of the best books of all time and managed to make into the big 1001 list. Most of the time, even if I don't like a book, I tend to understand why someone else picked it. In this case, I'm rather clueless. Is it, perhaps, that people see in it some message about humanity when Hanna won't purchase her freedom with the secret she has kept hidden for years? Is it the vivid sexual tale of a teenage boy with an older woman? Are we supposed to be shocked by it?The novel starts with a romance when fifteen year old Michael finds himself ill on the way home from school and is taken in by a woman twice his age. They begin an affair which is described by numerous critics as \"erotic\". This was the first hurdle my enjoyment came up against. When I was fifteen with raging hormones and an extremely good-looking history teacher, I would probably have been able to appreciate the eroticism of such an opportunity - to have an illicit affair with someone much older and experienced. But that's just a bunch of teenage fantasies that would never have become realities. Now, it creeps me out. I couldn't see it as a love story, I saw it as being about an adult who takes advantage of a child (all very ironic when I think aboutmy first interpretation of Lolita, but I guess I grew up somewhat).It has been suggested that we are expected to draw parallels between Hanna's secret and the behaviour of most German people during the second world war, that is why Schlink deliberately set the novel in this fragile post-war period. But I'm really not a fan of stories that are one big metaphor for something else... or no, maybe it isn't so much that I don't like that, but more that it has to be done in a manner which I find appealing and it has to be obvious. I refuse to believe in metaphors that have been proposed by some random critic and then jumped on by everyone else. I'm trying not to give away Hanna's secret in case there are people who haven't worked it out straight away, but I wasn't buying into this metaphor.This combined with the author's sparse tone quickly distanced me from the novel. I just prefer interesting and complex characters, an engaging plot, relationships I care about... I prefer all this over metaphor. In the end, metaphor is subjective and if I can't see it myself without someone else suggesting it to me then I believe either the author failed to make their metaphorical point clearly enough or the metaphor itself doesn't exist."

        "user_review": "There are some books you know will stay with you forever, and Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is definitely one of them. It has been highly critically acclaimed, winning the Boston Book Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, and it deserves all the praise it has received.The Holocaust is a difficult, though much covered, subject matter, and this novel has a sure touch and an appealing lack of judgment with it. The story begins in the world of almost-childhood of fifteen-year-old Michael Berg, recovering from a summer of hepatitis, begins a relationship with Hanna, a much older woman he meets by chance. The first part of the novel, untouched by the shadow of the recent war or Germany's disturbed and dangerous past, deals with Michael and Hanna's burgeoning relationship, and the little fears and worries that can make up one big problem. Eventually, as we know it must, their relationship ends and Hanna moves away.When the book moves on to the second part, the tone has changed considerably. Michael, now a law student, attends the trial of female Nazi war criminals. To his shock, one of them is Hanna, who had been a camp guard at Auschwitz. I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for you, but the Holocaust is seriously considered in the light of philosophy and moral responsibility. There is an attitude that one becomes numb to the horror of it all if too exposed to it, and this book does not go into ghastly detail, but rather examines even more painful details: who was to blame, how do we live with the suffering, how can one atone, and most of all, what is the next generation to do?It also looks at what it means to love someone, how much we can accept of them and how blind we can be to those we love. Love, guilt and betrayal feature prominently in this novel.In many ways Hanna was innocent, and yet it becomes apparent that she lived every day with terrible guilt; Michael was a victim of her actions, and yet he too is guilty by association. The reader of the title is Michael, who read to Hanna during the early part of the relationship; the reader is Hanna, alone in prison occupying herself by learning about the experiences of camp inmates. The reader is selected individuals in the camps who read aloud to Hanna, and may have died because of it. But most of all, the reader is ourselves; the title points the finger at us, because now we have the knowledge, what should we do with it? If all it takes for evil to prevail is for the good to remain silent, then how innocent are any of us? And how can we deal with the subsequent guilt? There are so many layers to this subtly complex novel that having just finished it, I have to start it again. The transforming power of words is negated by their ultimate futility, and actions in this novel speak deafeningly loud.If we have a responsibility towards the past, to learn from it, and I believe we do, then this book will help us to go some way towards fulfilling it."

And yet, its plot is not unrealistic or uncommon.It is about a sexual relationship between a young man and an older woman.It is about illiteracy and shame.It is about crimes against humanity, committed out of helplessness and an egocentric wish to hide one's own weakness.It is about the Holocaust weighing on the shoulders of post-1945 Germany's population.It is about the past being reshaped in memory when further knowledge about a person adds a new layer to a relationship.It is about the coexistence of complete indifference towards the lives of many human beings and compassion for one specific individual.It is surprisingly not much about hatred, despite the topic.It is about overcoming a disability.It is about facing justice - or not.It is painful to read. And yet hope hides in a corner.If you can't read it yourself, find someone who is willing to read it to you. Or record it on tape.

        "user_review": "The biggest problem I had with this book was the fact that it made me feel...nothing.I didn't feel connected to the characters or to any part of the plot. This is quite a bummer, as it deals with a pretty heavy topic.I feel like the author intended to write the story this way though, because the writing style in general has a certain type of \"coldness\" to it, and the true feelings of a character are never really explored. Some people might not be bothered by this, but I personally simply prefer feeling close and connected to the characters of a story.This doesn't make the entire book bad though. It certainly was interesting, andBernhard Schlinkis skillful with how he uses words. He describes mundane activities in a wonderful and fascinating way, and this makes me understand 100% why so many schools choose this novel as part of their required reading material.I also appreciated how he always got straight to the point, instead of writing unnecessary details to prolong the plot points we all already know are coming.I also couldn't help but feel disgusted at the things taking place in the first part of the book, and I wish the problematic aspects were explored further, instead of just brushing upon the issue later on.Overall, this was a good book to read inbetween, but nothing life changing or special."

        "user_review": "It's too simple to say I read any single book because I want to read it. There are dozens of reasons I'll pick up a particular title: I like the author; I like the subject matter; the book is an award winner; the book comes with many trusted recommendations; I was supposed to read the book in high school and I feel guilty because I playedGoldeneyeon my N64 instead. I will freely admit that I readWar and Peacesimply to say I readWar and Peace. I'd take it to the cafeteria every day and let peopleseeme with it. I was trying to project a certain image; unfortunately, the image I projected was a creepy loner way too interested in Russian melodrama.I readThe Readerbecause it had Nazis. And because it prominently featured a deviant sexual affair. Sold and sold.I dared think that Bernhard Schlink's novel might be that rarest of things, these days: truly transgressive. I mean, sex and Nazis and a literary pedigree to boot. Where do I sign up?This slim novel tells the story of an affair between 15 year-old Michael and the far-older Hanna, with whom he has an affair in West Germany in 1958. Hanna, a tram conductor, comes to Michael's aid when Michael falls ills. Later, Michael's mother forces Michael to go thank Hanna; after a laughably stupid seduction (the literary equivalent of that old porn standby, the copy repairman), the two are having an affair.I guess this is shocking? Taboo busting? I don't know. I can't really muster much moral outrage at statutory rape when it is set against the recent background of the Holocaust. Moreover, the scenes between the two \"lovers\" (how I despise that phrase!) are written in such a mundane, clinical fashion, that I could only speculate that Schlink (or his translator) was a technical writer, taking time off from telling me the side effects of Ditropan. (In reality, Schlink is a judge, and I suppose the detached, just-the-facts-ness ofThe Readercould be compared to a legal brief).The affair goes on for awhile. It doesn't generate much heat, since both the main characters are constructed out of cardboard, with macaroni faces and yarn for hair. The title is also explained - partially - because Michael must read aloud to Hanna before they Biblically unite. That sound you hear is my eyes rolling.Eventually, Hanna disappears. Seven years later, Michael is a law student, and he attends a war crimes trial where - SHOCK! - Hanna is on trial. Turns out she was a concentration camp guard: think Mary Kay Letourneau crossed with Heinrich Himmler.It's hard to screw up a novel about a Nazi pedophile, but it happens here.There is always going to be tension when a fictional work of art (using that term loosely) is set against the backdrop of a recent tragedy. Until the last person who survived said tragedy is dead, any author daring to touch the subject is going to get dinged a little. We can all argue about the morality of such fictionalizations, but the point is moot. It's going to happen.Schlink obviously knew the dangers going in, and tried to avoid them. In doing so, he wrote a book that is simply flat. There are two directions to take a story like this. First, there is over-the-top,Inglorious Basterds-style pulp. Just accept that your book is basically fan-fiction from theSS Experiment Campline of movies, and wait for Cinemax to call with an offer. The second direction is to make a serious, searching novel about an ordinary person who survived the Holocaust, but as a cog in the machinery of death, rather than a survivor. Explore how that person lives each day wtih the things he or she has done. This kind of book would take a lot of psychological digging, and there aren't a lot of authors up to this task.The Readertries to do a little of both, and ends up a big, dull, intellecutally-insulting dud. As already noted, the love affair generates slightly less heat than the pairing of Liza Minnelli and David Gest. The decision to include a statutorily illegal relationship was obviously meant to garner attention, but it fails to shock, titilate, or even vaguely incite any interest.The transition to the courtroom, and beyond, is even worse. Here, the author makes a half-hearted attempt to avoid moral relativism, and then falls right into that trap. In an epic bit of reductionism, Schlink manages to equate the tragedy of the Holocaust with - spoiler alert, I guess - adult illiteracy. If only that was a joke.Schlink's idea of depth is to fill a couple of pages with facile hypothetical questions that he helpfully leaves unanswered. All the better; I doubt I would care about what answers he discovered.While Part I ofThe Readeris a tepid affair between two paper dolls, and Part II reduces the Holocaust to one SS Guard's illiterate shame, Part III manages, stunningly, to get worse. The epilogue, which must be read to be believed, is so stilted, awkward, and glib that I almost felt bad for the characters/ciphers forced to utter the tortured dialogue.I suppose I got what I deserved. It's like when you click on a hyperlink for naked celebrity photos and get a computer virus instead. (Or so I've been told...) I picked up this book thinking it might be trashy, and it turned out it was, but just not the kind of trash I enjoy."

This is the perfect case for show don't tell done in just the way that even when we get told something, we see it.A lot of painfully salient topics raised in here. Gross ones, of course. Horrible ones. Stanley Milgram would've been so effing proud...Review to follow.Q:Maybe I did write our story to be free of it, even if I never can be. (c)Q:Hanna became absorbed in the unfolding of the book. But it was different this time; she withheld her own opinions; she didn't make Natasha, Andrei, and Pierre part of her world, as she had Luise and Emilia, but entered their world the way one sets out on a long and dazzling journey, or enters a castle which one is allowed to visit, even stay in until one feels at home, but without ever really shedding one's inhibitions. All the things I had read to her before were already familiar to me. War and Peace was new for me, too. We took the long journey together. (c)Q:The fact that I came later than the others or left earlier, depending on Hanna' s schedule, didn't hurt my reputation, but made me interesting. I knew that. I also knew that I wasn't missing anything, and yet I often had the feeling that absolutely everything could be happening while I wasn't there. There was a long stretch when I did not dare ask myself whether I would rather be at the swimming pool or with Hanna. (с)Q:Then I began to betray her. (c)Q:I know that disavowal is an unusual form of betrayal. From the outside it is impossible to tell if you are disowning someone or simply exercising discretion, being considerate, avoiding embarrassments and sources of irritation. But you, who are doing the disowning, you know what you're doing. And disavowal pulls the underpinnings away from a relationship just as surely as other more flamboyant types of betrayal. (c)Q:At first I told myself that I wasn't yet close enough to my friends to tell them about Hanna. Then I didn't find the right opportunity, the right moment, the right words. And finally it was too late to tell them about Hanna, to present her along with all my other youthful secrets. I told myself that talking about her so belatedly would misrepresent things, make it seem as if I had kept silent about Hanna for so long because our relationship wasn't right and I felt guilty about it. But no matter what I pretended to myself, I knew that I was betraying Hanna when I acted as if I was letting myfriends in on everything important in my life but said nothing about Hanna. (c)Q:\"There's another reason I arrive later or leave earlier.\"\"Do you not want to talk about it, or is it that you want to but you don't know how?\" (c)Q:We did not have a world that we shared; she gave me the space in her life that she wanted me to have. I had to be content with that. Wanting more, even wanting to know more, was presumption on my part. (c)Q:But I knew it was her. She stood and looked — and it was too late. (c)Q:Everything was easy; nothing weighed heavily. Perhaps that is why my bundle of memories is so small. Or do I keep it small? I also wonder if my memory of happiness is even true. If I think about it more, plenty of embarrassing and painful situations come to mind, and I know that even if I had said goodbye to my memory of Hanna, (c)Q:I had not overcome it. Never to let myself be humiliated or humiliate myself after Hanna, never to take guilt upon myself or feel guilty, never again to love anyone whom it would hurt to lose — I didn't formulate any of this as I thought back then, but I know that's how I felt. I adopted a posture of arrogant superiority. I behaved as if nothing could touch or shake or confuse me. I got involved in nothing, and I remember a teacher who saw through this and spoke to me about it; I was arrogantly dismissive. ...I also remember that the smallest gesture of affection would bring a lump to my throat, whether it was directed at me or at someone else. Sometimes all it took was a scene in a movie. This juxtaposition of callousness and extreme sensitivity seemed suspicious even to me. (c)Q:The more horrible the events about which we read and heard, the more certain we became of our responsibility to enlighten and accuse. Even when the facts took our breath away, we held them uptriumphantly. Look at this! (c)Q:She had no sense of context, of the rules of the game, of the formulas by which her statements and those of the others were toted up into guilt and innocence, conviction and acquittal. To compensate for her defective grasp of the situation, her lawyer would have had to have more experience and self-confidence, or simply to have been better. (c)Q:She was not pursuing her own interests, but fighting for her owntruth, her own justice. Because she always had to dissimulate somewhat, and could never becompletely candid, it was a pitiful truth and a pitiful justice, but it was hers, and the strugglefor it was her struggle.She must have been completely exhausted. Her struggle was not limited to the trial. She wasstruggling, as she always had struggled, not to show what she could do but to hide what shecouldn't do. A life made up of advances that were actually frantic retreats and victories thatwere concealed defeats. (c)Q:I knew about the helplessness in everyday activities, finding one's way or finding an address or choosing a meal in a restaurant, about how illiterates anxiously stick to prescribed patterns and familiar routines, about how much energy it takes to conceal one's inability to read and write, energy lost to actual living. Illiteracy is dependence. By finding the courage to learn to read andwrite, Hanna had advanced from dependence to independence, a step towards liberation. (c)Q:I was proud of her. At the same time, I was sorry for her, sorry for her delayed and failed life, sorry for the delays and failures of life in general. I thought that if the right time gets missed, if one has refused or been refused something for too long, it's too late, even if it is finally tackled with energy and received with joy. Or is there no such thing as \"too late\"? Is there only \"late,\" and is \"late\" always better than \"never\"? I don't know. (c)Q:I still said nothing. I could not have spoken; all I could have done was to stammer and weep. (c)Q:She didn't seem unhappy or dissatisfied. In fact it was as though the retreat to the convent was no longer enough, as though life in the convent was still too sociable and talkative, and she had to retreat even further, into a lonely cell safe from all eyes, where looks, clothing, and smell meant nothing. No, it would be wrong to say that she had given up. She redefined her place in a way that was right for her, but no longer impressed the other women. ...Can the world become so unbearable to someone after years of loneliness?Is it better to kill yourself than to return to the world from the convent, from the hermitage?(c)Q:if something hurts me, the hurts I suffered back then come back to me, and when I feel guilty, the feelings of guilt return; if I yearn for something today, or feel homesick, I feel the yearnings andhomesickness from back then. (c)Q:The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as matter that has been fully formed and pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive. (c)Q:Whatever I had done or not done, whatever she had done or not to me — it was the path my life had taken. (c)"

        "user_review": "There have been many ways over the years in which literature has found a path to deal with the Holocaust and its consequences, but a book about the inability to be able to read might not seem the most obvious. Yet in terms of attracting a mass audience, something that Schlink has clearly done, this German novel with illiteracy at its heart published back in the mid-90's, has been a phenomenon amongst readers.Bernhard Schlink's forth and easily most popular novel opens in post-war Germany when a teenage boy, Michael Berg (who also narrates), embarks on a love affair with a thirty-something woman, Hanna, who disappears, then years later turns up in the dock as a former concentration camp guard accused of the mass murder of Jewish women locked in a burning church. Michael, by now a law student observing the trial, realises that Hanna is a secret illiterate, a fact that has profoundly affected her actions in the past as well as fatally undermining her defence in court. Schlink says that writing about illiteracy \"was there when I started to think about the book. I did a great deal of research into it, but I never had an objective beyond telling that story. I'm sure the things I think about and worry about in other contexts play into the stories I write. But I do not know how they do that, and I'm really uninterested in the epistemology of my writing.\" The theme certainly chimes, in terms of dramatically echoing the Third Reich's moral illiteracy, but the way the book has been enthusiastically taken up and used almost as documentary points to an impact that has far exceeded Schlink's immediate narrative ambitions.The hapless Hanna, conscientiously unscrupulous in the performance of her labor-camp duties, committed crimes against humanity, obviously. But what of the young law student who denies her his word, his aid? The paralyzing shame, the psychic numbing, the moral failures of the lucky late-born are the novel's central focus. Nazi holdovers in postwar Germany are denounced only at the margins of the story, so to speak. But this oblique approach has its own power. In one quietly disturbing scene, Michael visits the nearest concentration camp, Struthof, in Alsace that had a sign on it indicating that it had been a gas chamber. But Schlink spares his readers the sickening details.Literature is not only a bridge between the generations, sometimes it may get closer to the truth of recent history than benumbed eyewitness accounts. But this redemptive magic has its limits. Substituting great books for human contact is a cowardly dodge. At the novel's somber conclusion, Michael betrays Hanna yet again. On Hanna though, if one would call this more holocaust literaturethan a legal thriller with sex in it, then criticism of the book, from people who treat it as Holocaust literature, are right to say that Schlink doesn't come to a proper judgment of Hanna. Schlink acknowledges that he has been criticised for not unambiguously condemning Hanna. Is this fair? I think his novel can be open to so many interpretations. Guess that's part of it's appeal.All this aside, I just found the novel top to bottom rather bland. It brings up many questions, yes, and for the most part it at least held my curiosity. But seeing that it sold in huge numbers I expected much more. Maybe it's shortish length didn't help, it felt like not enough pages are actually given to alluding as to the true horrors of Hanna's crimes and the rest of it is simply the diatribe and musings of a teenage boy. Maybe I am missing the point? As books about the legacy of the holocaust go, there are much better ones out there than this. I will also say I much preferred the film over the book. With Kate Winslet giving a tour-de-force performance as Hanna."

        "user_review": "There are certain books which have an impact on one, without one being able to put one's finger exactly on the reason why. 'The Reader' by Bernhard Schlink is such a book.The experience of reading this book was like taking a train ride through a pleasant landscape: you mosey along comfortably, enjoying the view and the climate, settled and relaxed. The journey is comfortable enough without being anything out of the ordinary. Then suddenly, the train enters a section of the countryside which is breathtaking in its beauty, and you are jolted out of your somnolence. You sit up and watch, your nose glued to the window, watching with rapt attention. You are unaware of the journey's passing, of temporal time, so engrossed are you in the present experience.The tale of 15-year-old Michael Berg (the first-person narrator) and thirty-something Hanna Schmidt, a tram conductor in post WW-2 Germany is pretty sordid in the beginning; having collapsed from hepatitis in front of her house, he is taken care of and helped home by her. Michael's thank-you visit to Hanna after convalescing, however, becomes a voyeuristic session and it's not long before they are lovers. It is an adolescent's fantasy come true, a bit likeLolitain reverse.The tale takes on a different twist once Michael starts reading to Hanna. Apparently, she can't get enough of his stories. So their sexual escapades are now connected to prolonged reading sessions which each one of them enjoys. But Hanna still remains an enigma to Michael with her erratic behaviour, an enigma which becomes all the more inexplicable when she disappears on the threshold of her promotion as tram driver.The next time he sees her, she is in the dock. Hanna is charged as a Nazi war criminal, a guard of a small concentration camp near Cracow, a satellite camp for Auschwitz. She is accused, along with others, of causing the death of a group of camp inmates by locking them up in a burning church. As a law student, Michael is covering her trial. Hanna's strange, self-destructive behaviour in the courtroom as well as her unusual acts as the camp guard (providing vulnerable young inmates with special status in the camp, to read books to her, until they were sent to Auschwitz to their death) intrigue him. One day, linking it to their sex-cum-reading sessions, he makes a startling discovery about his one-time lover...Later on, Michael is a disillusioned middle-aged man, with a failed marriage and a colourless life. He finds that he cannot exorcise Hanna from his psyche. At the end of his tether, he hits upon a unique solution: Michael finds solace for himself, as well as redemption for Hanna, through his old medium - that of reading.***Ultimately, what is this book about? Is it about paedophilia, or an adolescent fantasy? Is it about Nazism, and man's cruelty towards man? Is it the tale of a Germany coming to terms with its Nazi past, disguised as a coming-of-age story?I, personally, would like to see it as an allegory on the redemptive power of storytelling. In all cultures, bards enjoyed a special, revered status - in India, it approaches the divine (think ofVyasaandValmiki). Here, Hanna's sins - both the carnal as well as the homicidal - are linked with getting stories read to her; so, unusually, is her redemption in the last part of the book.Hanna Schmidt is a masterly creation. In the short span of 200+ pages, the author has brought to life an engrossing character who remains a puzzle until the very end.This is one holocaust story which does not take the trodden path."

        "user_review": "This book just fell short with me, on oh so many levels. One thing that did intrigue me and that I have not yet seen much of is the perspective of Germans after the Holocaust and their views on the Third Reich and Hitler's agenda, especially of the younger generation of that time. That was really the only thing that struck me about this book. The rest was just not enough. For one, the affair between MIchael and Hanna was deplorable. Is it supposed to not be as bothersome because it is an older woman with a teenage boy, rather than an older man with a teenage girl? Either way, in my opinion, it's just not palatable and I felt neither sympathy for either of the characters nor did I feel that it was relatable on many levels at all whatsoever. The writing fell flat for me and was rather dry. Not in the beautiful sparse language trends of Hemingway, but in an annoying succinct manner that just left each situation as it occurred \"as is\" with nothing left to ponder. I noticed that this novel has won awards and while it means absolutely nothing to me because her choices are not always great or even good in the least, but it was on Oprah's Book Club list a number of years back. Neither are good enough reasons for anyone to read this book, in my opinion. Spare yourselves and read a nice historical account of Germany after the Holocaust, if you are inclined. I am sure it would be much richer reading in any case than this novel."

Kate Winslet was even better than I'd expected, and that's saying quite a bit.Maybe I'll finally get serious about improving my German... no question about the appropriateness of the book._______________________[After reading: posted early 2019]It's funny how all the books you read link up inside you and start talking to each other. I finishedDer Vorlesera week or so ago, and for once I just didn't know what to say. Everything I thought of seemed inadequate. But then yesterday I started Romain Gary'sChien blanc, which a French friend had recommended to me, and after a couple of hours I found a scene that brought everything into focus.In Gary's supposedly autobiographical novel, the author, who's living in 1968 LA, adopts a stray dog, a German shepherd he calls Batka. Gary is a dog person, Batka is a kind, good-natured dog, and they really hit it off. Within days, Gary and his wife feel he's part of the family. But then a terrible and unexpected thing happens. A guy comes to clean their pool, and the moment Batka sees the visitor he's transformed into a murderous, snarling beast. Teeth bared, he lunges at the terrified pool cleaner, who's luckily still on the other side of the gate. Gary can barely hold him back. He apologises profusely and the pool cleaner, still shaking, leaves. A couple of days later, the same thing happens again, this time with a Western Union delivery boy.Gary thinks about it, and there's a link between the two incidents which is distressingly obvious: the pool cleaner and the delivery boy were both black, all their other visitors that week have been white. He takes Batka to a friend who's an expert on animals, and the friend confirms his suspicions. Batka is a \"white dog\", a dog who's been painstakingly trained to attack blacks. They have them in the American South. Originally, they tracked escaped slaves; now the police use them against demonstrators. Gary's friend says Batka, who is about seven, is way too old to be retrained and is highly dangerous. The only sensible thing is to put him down.Gary sits with the dog for several hours. Then he takes Batka to his car and visits a friend who lends him a revolver. They drive out to an isolated place in the woods. They get out of the car. Batka is happy to be with his master. He sits expectantly, waiting for new instructions. Gary takes out the revolver. Batka knows what is is, but he doesn't run. He just sits where he is, looking at Gary sadly. Gary aims, but he's now crying so much that he can't see properly. He fires and misses. Batka still doesn't run. Instead, he slowly walks over to Gary and licks the barrel of the gun. Gary can't take any more. They get back in the car and drive home.Well,Der Vorleseris like that. Except that it's not a stray dog he's known for a week, it's the love of his life."

She helps him and the two start to have a very passionate and erotic affair together. They make love and the boy starts reading regularly to the woman and becomes her reader. Many years later when Michael becomes a law student, he is shocked to see the same woman on a trial in Germany being questioned about her role in a horrible war crime. Faced with a dilemma, Michael knows a secret about Hanna that she keeps hiding and could reduce her sentence. But will he do it? Will he betray her?\"I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. The more I suffer, the more I love. Danger will only increase my love. It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. I will be the only angel you need. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love.\"The book consists of three parts and narrated from Michael's point of view. I have watched the movie adaptation which stars Kate Winslet in which she portrayed the main character Hanna for which she won the Academy Award for best actress that year. I loved the film a lot and decided to read the book but I wanted to wait until I couldn't remember much about the film. Today is about 13 years since I've watched the film and while reading the story I kept remembering Kate Winslet in every frame and scene from the book. I understand this is not a story that is suitable for every reader. There are several trigger warnings.\"What is law? Is it what is on the books, or what is actually enacted and obeyed in a society? Or is law what must be enacted and obeyed, whether or not it is on the books, if things are to go right?\"The writing style is very beautiful and shows lots of emotional depth in a few words. I feel both the main characters were persons with so little to say yet their emotions talked a lot about them. The author brilliantly captured Hanna's different emotional states without her saying much. Michael's maturity can be felt by the readers during the three different life stages. When it comes to the subjects the book tackles they are many, the taboo relationship, Holocaust crimes, and crimes against humanity, the shame of illiteracy, and how much a person can say he knows others to be then shocked by what he didn't know. There is a lot that this story tells without the need to get into tedious details. I loved it!\"...if something hurts me, the hurts I suffered back then come back to me, and when I feel guilty, the feelings of guilt return; if I yearn for something today, or feel homesick, I feel the yearnings and homesickness from back then. The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as matter that has been fully formed and pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive.\""

It is the gap of shallowed empathetic experience.The Readeris about this gap. It is about the mystery of what something must have felt like and this 'something' in the book is Holocaust. Michael Berg, the narrator, is the 'second generation' of the Holocaust. His relationship with an older woman, one of the SS guards at the Nazi camp, is the relationship of the 'first generation' with the 'second'. The novel questions what the second generation would do. This question, like Hanna's question to the judge (\". . . so what would you have done?\"), lingers and floats in mid-air.The novel is packed in many intricate and complex layers. It leaves many questions that will remain unanswered; at least, in my case, the questions are still wavering around. I have no hopes of ever finding any answer. As I said, there will always be the gaps of shallowed empathetic experience."

        "user_review": "Wow.This is a wild ride. If you like Philip K. Dick's writing and wondered what would happen if you extended his vision into the not too distant future, if you liked Bladerunner, if you liked The Matrix … and even if you like all the film and fiction that has made an attempt to be any of the above, you will love Neuromancer.William Gibson said that while writing Neuromancer he went to see the Ridley Scott film Bladerunner and thought that his ideas for the book were hopelessly lost, that everyone would naturally assume that he had taken all of his queues from the film. I have written that Bladerunner was that most rare of accomplishments, a film that was as good or better than the book. Bladerunner was of course patterned loosely afterDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?by Phillip K. Dick. One reason why Bladerunner was as good was because Scott's vision was so different from Dick's. Bladerunner was a distinctly cyberpunk vision, whereas Dick's was dystopian but not necessarily cyberpunk.Neuromancer has been called the definitive, benchmark novel of the cyberpunk sub-genre. Gibson takes his influences from Escape from New York, Anthony Burgess and from Phillip K. Dick, among others, but then goes to a wholly different level. It can even be said that Gibson, who in turn heavily influenced the producers of The Matrix, is a bridge between the older 60s post-modernist dystopian science fiction with the more modern, computer driven, angst ridden world weariness that has represented artists since the 80s. Neuromancer defined the genre and I could hardly go a few pages without noticing how it had influenced literature and film since.As a book, this was excellent, I could not put it down. Gibson creates an edge, a tension that exists throughout the narrative that grabs the reader and won't let him go. Gibson is the literary successor to Phillip K. Dick, an observer who does not skip ahead to a distant dystopian rebirth, but instead chronicles the ugly fall itself.******* 2018 re-readAs I type these words here in June of 2018, Goodreads says that I have rated over 1400 books and have reviewed over 1300. Of these I have listed six as being my all-time favorites. After thinking about Neuromancer for years and having just re-read it, almost literally not putting it down, I am adding this to my very short list of beloved books.The PKD allusions are still there as is the Bosch-esque attention to detail – this is a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds and ideas coming at you at ludicrous speed. There are also the references to Bladerunner and Escape from New York and this makes me think of the shared consciousness and Jungian gestalt cultural observations that Gibson was tapping into in the early eighties. What was going on in this time that made such talented artists as Ridley Scott and John Carpenter also envision such a world?What caught my eye this time around was the noir elements to the story and Gibson's writing, heavy but fast moving as it is, tunes into a retro style that you can almost hear Harrison Ford's Deckard narrating as Case gets to the bottom of the twin AI mystery.At it's heart, this is of course THE cyberpunk novel, honorable mention to Neal Stephenson's 1992Snow Crash. Gibson was jacked into a time and space phenomena that was just below the subconscious and so struck a chord with so many. But it is also a timeless speculative fiction novel in the sense that it depicts human isolation and technological alienation that Yevgeny Zamyatin and E.M. Forster wrote about decades before. Necromancer's influence on the Matrix films makes it the Godfather of post-modern techno-punk thrillers.A must read.*** 2022 reread –As before I was quickly taken in to Gibson's world and carried through the story on his tightly packed prose and then dumped unceremoniously at the end, gasping for breath and again impressed with this unique literary experience that is Neuromancer.If this were music it would be a wall of sound, a cacophony of noise that at first seems chaotic and yet the listener is soon absorbed into the composition, identifying and distinguishing various melodies and themes within the complex score.I think I've wondered this before but will formally wonder now and here: was Gibson inspired by the writings of John Varley? There seems to be some similarities in style and theme and if so I like Varley even more.Case and Molly are archetypes now, the anti-hero and the tech femme fatale. Wintermute and Neuromancer are twin godfathers of the Matrix and all the stories that fall into that genre.Cannot believe that I let four years go by between readings and this may / should be an annual reread for me."

        "user_review": "For well over 20 years, I have seen copies of William Gibson's \"Neuromancer\" on the Sci-Fi/Fantasy shelves of nearly every bookstore I have gone into. I recently decided to pick up a copy and read it. I figured a book that's been continuously in print for over twenty years and is considered a ground-breaking work in Science Fiction had to be good. I figured wrong.\"Neuromancer\" is a very convoluted novel. It jumps from local to local and situation to situation in a very jerky way. To add to the confusion, a good chunk of the novel takes place in a 1980's cyberspace that seems very dated to this 21st century reader. Gibson utterly fails at making any of the characters or settings come to life. And, the action isn't very active. There's plenty of sex and violence in the book, but it's all very pedestrian. (The violence is slightly more exciting than the sex.) I couldn't even bring myself to care about the \"hero\" and what happens to him. He has no passion, even when his ability to plug into the matrix is restored. There is an overwhelming sense of hopelessness to the novel that doesn't ever let up. It's depressing from beginning to end.\"Neuromancer\" is considered to be groundbreaking in that it brought us the sub-genre of cyberpunk. However, it's just not very good. For a much better cyberpunk read, try Neal Stephenson's \"Snow Crash.\" It has many of the same elements as \"Neuromancer,\" but it's fleshed out better, has better character development and brings both the real world and cyberspace to life."

        "user_review": "Eureka!...Hallelujah!...I've had a wondrousepiphany!I finally get it...I have seen the light andunderstandinghas dawned. Gibson's manifestbrilliancehas revealed itself to me and I am left humbled andquiveringinAWE.After a rocky, tumultuouscourtshipthat oscillated between respect and frustration through my first two readings ofNeuromancer, number 3 became theCHARMing, rapturous awakening into a hopelessly devoted, head over heals love affair that I'm confident will last a lifetime. Now, with the ebullient fervor of the newlyconverted, I feel compelled to give testimony andproselytizethe glory that is William Gibson's singular masterpiece.To begin...a small history.INITIAL THOUGHTS:My first exposure to this book was late in the 1990's, long after it had already spent over a decade as the magical source of all things cyberpunk. I came to it after having read several of its prolific spawn and decided it was time to visit the source code.My first mistake...for \"Neuromancer\" is not the first cyberpunk novel or at least, that is not all it is...not even close. I viewed the novel within the narrow confines of the world that it had created and completely missed its true magic. I saw the novel through the fog of my faulty preconceptions.I believed Neuromancer to be a jargon-heavy, inside joke by the techno-savvy and the computer literate as they thumbed their nose at thetech-tarded ludditeswho couldn't see the pending future that lay before them. I saw this as a novel for thecyberspaciallyerudite, and those not coded for the new paradigm were to be left behind in the trash heap of history along with the abacus and the printed word.For those who have had a similar reaction to this book, you...I...we were so, so, SOwrong.It missed the point entirely. Neuromancer didn't preach to the creators of the new, new thing...it wasn't even, at its core, about technology...at least not in theinstructional manual, code-writing sense of the word. William Gibson was more techno-stupid than techno-proficient and his interpretation of the interpretation of the future was the vision of an artist not an engineer. In fact, the few areas where Gibson had any knowledge about what he was writing are the areas that have become the most anachronistic.What Gibson did see...with a clarity and exactitude that would make Nostradamus green with envy, was the path on which humanity was travelling. Increased dependance on technology, increased detachment among individuals and a blurring of lines between nations. And all of this led to that central, crystalizing vision of cyberspace, artificial intelligence and the world wide web.And now we come to the reason why this book belongs among the MOST IMPORTANT WORKS OF LITERATURE ever created. Gibson's inspired, non-technical vision of the future was the lightning that created the fire of inspiration for the generation that then made his vision come to pass. The teenagers and bidding technophiles of the 1980's saw the \"fictional elements\" of Gibson's novel and said, \"holy shit, wouldn't that be cool\"...and proceeded to make it so.From Neuromancer's memorable first words,\"The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel\"to the final, mind-shattering conclusion of the mystery ofWinter Mute...this novel is probably the greatest example of life imitating art that literature has ever known and our world would be profoundly different, for good or for ill, in the absence of this amazing work.....WOW, sorry for waxing on so long, but like I said, I am the newly converted.PLOT SUMMARY:Our protagonist, Case, is an amoral, ex-cyber cowboy (i.e., hacker) whose former bosses destroyed his ability to enter the matrix (i.e., cyberspace) as a punishment for his stealing from them.They damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian mycotoxin. Strapped to a bed in a Memphis hotel, his talent burning out micron by micron, he hallucinated for thirty hours. The damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective. For Case, who'd lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace, it was the Fall.Since his involuntary exile from the matrix, Case has become self-destructive and suicidal and is hell bent on shuffling off this mortal coil but is unwilling or unable to accomplish the task himself.A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he'd cut in Night City, and he'd still see the matrix in his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless void… The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.in his \"i wanna die\" despondency, Case has been taking the most dangerous scores, the biggest risks, all along waiting for someone to put him out of his \"meat-trapped\" misery.That is the \"hero\" of our little tale.After this brief intro and some layered world-building involving Chiba City, Case finds himself recruited by a group of criminals who agree to \"cure him\" in exchange for working with them on a complex caper involving aspects of cyberspace hacking and real world breaking and entering. That is really the basic set up (though it gives you less than a hint of the real flavor of the book). The heist/hack is really comprised of two primary \"jobs\" that are both connected to a burgeoning artificial intelligence known as Winter Mute. That is really a bare bones description of the plot, but there are so many well crafted summaries floating around that I wanted to stick mainly with commentary.MORE THOUGHTS:Gibson's prose is like nothing I have read before and it took me a while to come to grips with that statement. Gibson's writing is poetry, not jargon. It's personal, internal and emotional, not cold and externally descriptive. It's the dark, fevered dream of a world where humanity and technology have been inextricably fused together with results both miraculous and profane. His prose is slick and jagged like a serrated knife; beautiful, breezy and hard-edged. His verse is color of gunmetal and electricity and the texture of anger spilling on a meadow of dashed hope and unearned rewards. It is as much about mood as it is about message. Here's an example:The drug hit him like an express train, a white-hot column of light mounting his spine from the region of his prostate, illuminating the sutures of his skull with x-rays of short-circuited sexual energy. His teeth sang in their individual sockets like tuning forks, each one pitch-perfect and clear as ethanol. His bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed and polished, the joints lubricated with a film of silicone. Sandstorms raged across the scoured floor of his skull, generating waves of high thin static that broke behind his eyes, spheres of purest crystal, expanding...The anger was expanding, relentless, exponential, riding out behind the betaphenethylamine rush like a carrier wave, a seismic fluid, rich and corrosive.Yeah, I am a big, big fan. In case I wasn't clear about that before, I don't want you to think I was being wishy-washy. Before i wrap up, here is one more example of the visual, visceral nature of Gibson's verse:Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button. Stop hustling and you sank without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you'd break the fragile surface tension of the black market; either way, you were gone, with nothing left of you but some vague memory in the mind of a fixture like Ratz, though heart or lungs or kidneys might survive in the service of some stranger with New Yen for the clinic tanks.A unique, important and truly amazing reading experience and it only took me three tries to realize it.

        "user_review": "Let's get digital in one of the milestones of modern Sci-fi enabling a little beast called Cyberpunk, also known as the coming future, to enter the scene.His Nostradamiam abilities don´t just include the internet, but also corporatocracies controlling everything, cannibalizing the state, grown out of the once, in a very short period of time between 1945 and 1970 in some regions, fairer social and economic systems, now making neoliberals and Milton fangirls and boys happy because they can watch the downfall of all civilizations that could be paradises with a tiny grain of distributional justice. We are not even talking about an unrealistic 50 50 or something, just a few percent of what the 1 percent owns, to just leave them with something between 40 to 45 percent of all wealth left, would be enough to solve all human problems.But history is over, greed has won, politics and faith are out of the game, and predator turbo capitalism rules the world, Dystopian nightmares become reality everywhere, ranging from true Orwellian visions that might become impossible to rebel against because of the grade of surveillance enabled by technology, to dead, pseudo fringe democracies controlled by lobbyism and consumerism while most of the population is starving and impoverishing, numbing themselves with consumption and drugs. Not to mention nature, she´s already dead.The combination of neurochemistry pimped by drugs, AI´s and implants is, in contrast to the dirt, desperation, and filth of this wasted megacities, something seemingly pure and clinical, also close to positive, because it shows that advanced medicine and pharmacy could be used for good too, but aren´t or can´t.The internet is an easy, cheap, and understandable alternative in a world without hope and perspective, something that is already happening with the main target audience for self destructive behavior, hopeless male teenagers and young adults that are fleeing reality for social, and still not economic reasons, because the superficiality of a predator mobbing society is nothing they long for. But soon they´ll be joined by hundreds of millions and billions of others whose only option for a good life outside a desperate job and social life will be fictional AR and VR worlds, which is also very attractive for governments and corporations, because it´s cheap and easy to avoid revolutions by having happy, busy slaves who are just thinking about their next World of Warcraft raid.All of this is inevitable, because a fairer, eco social, strong state model with universal basic income, 15 hour workweeks, and open bordershttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...would cost the wealthy elite, as mentioned, a few percent and they will wait until it´s close to total collapse, civil war, total inevitable destruction of all of nature´s treasures, etc. before they change the lucrative, neo feudal system. Or just threaten the stubborn country with leaving it or unleashing the Cerberus chain dog lawyer armadas to litigate billions out of corporate unfriendly rebel maverick states.This subgenre of Sci-Fi, just as the games that are coming out at the moment; is the most important one in contrast to the ones that are playing hundreds and thousands of years in the future and have already fixed the problems with logical technological and socio economical methods we are too greedy and stupid to use at the moment, because it could prevent the catastrophe if anything in the political and economic circuses would be changed, if creative visions would be seen as worthy of being discussed and not seen as unrealistic fiction, even if one can already look out of the window and see its awakening and dawn. There are other, classic or unknown, and a bit hard-sci-fi authorshttps://www.goodreads.com/author/show...https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...that are playing with these themes that are even going into more detail in describing how Western democracies are and will be failing.Worthless personal note as extra infodump: I don´t play games at the moment, will maybe restart it as a midlife crisis hobby, when whatever follows 8k is on the market, and I can waste my silver years gaming and reading, but I read about the developments in gaming and analysis of the underlying themes.The funny and tragic thing is that, as mentioned, far future sci-fi sees the solution of all of these problems, in most of them there is a good, enlightened fraction that used technology and science to automate everything to form a post scarcity utopia, and that these works aren´t seen as important beacons towards realizing a better tomorrow, but as trivial fiction. All of these things will happen, it´s inevitable and necessary epigenetic human evolution fueled by a technological singularity, but it will be too late for the only real and first habitable planet garden Eden humankind once had. Remember, back then, a century ago at the beginning of the 20th century, when most of the world´s nature was still existing?This work is truly nothing for all readers, it´s unconventional, Gibson´s style needs getting used to for not sci-fi prone readers, and some of his later works are more meh, because he starts recycling his topics, getting redundant, not investing as much time in plotting and character development as would be necessary, and losing control over or interest in finetuning plotlines and premise. Consider this if you are a bit picky with your genre conventions, everyone else, enjoy the implications, innuendos, and connotations.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "A lozenge is a shape. Like a cube, or a triangle, or a sphere. I know that every time he types it, you are going to imagine a cough drop flying serenely by, but it's a shape. It's from heraldry for god's sake. You may want to look up some synonyms to insert for yourself when he uses it, here are a few: diamond, rhombus, mascle.Now that the greatest obstacle in Gibson's vocabulary has been dealt with, I can tell you that he writes in one of the finest voices of any Science Fiction author. His ability to describe things in succinct, exciting, sexy ways is almost certainly the reason we owe him for words like 'cyberspace'.It took twenty years for his visions of leather-clad kung-fu ladies and brain-computer interfaces to reach the mainstream in The Matrix, but only because he was that far ahead of his time.However, Gibson was no early adopter. He used a typewriter to write a book that predicted the internet, virtual reality, hacking, and all the nonsense we're embroiled in now (and some stuff we're still waiting for). It can sometimes feel unoriginal, but, much like Shakespeare, that's because what we have today is based on what he was doing then.Though Gibson may not be as radical as Dick, or as original as Bradbury, there is something in his words, his stories, and his 'coolness factor' that keep bringing me back. Indeed, he is much more accessible than the philosophically remote Dick, Bradbury, or Ellison, and all in a slick package.Just don't try to watch Johnny Mnemonic. Ever. He did write the best X-Files episode, though: 'Kill Switch'. He also wrote a script for Alien 3, which I have never read, but can state with certainty was better than the one they chose to film."

        "user_review": "Wow. What a terrible book.First, let me just say that I read for entertainment value. Anything else that happens is gravy. That being said- the biggest reason this book is so awful is that Gibson's characters are completely hollow. Gibson makes it up as he goes along. He'll introduce a character, barely describe him and then 10 chapters later toss in another description. As if to say \"Oh, yeah did I mention his hands were chainsaws? Yeah, they were totally chainsaws. Cool right?\"The reason this is such a headache is that once your mind's eye has cast the characters, as shallow as they are, all of a sudden there's a new dimension tossed in. He doesn't just do this with characters, he does it with locations as well. Never giving you a chance to really place the characters in a setting. Other than \"a dark city street.\" I mean, Try a little harder Gibson. I'm not a writer, but isn't that a sign of BAD WRITING?The second reason this book is so bad, is Gibson's writing \"style\". I hate writing \"styles\". Stop trying to show off and just tell me a story. The \"style\" makes Neuromancer a very difficult book to read. I'd read 2 or 3 chapters and literally have no idea what was going on. Gibson will write a whole page with four lines of dialog and the rest of the page will describe absolutely nothing. Reminds me of the Mark Twain quote: \"Don't say the old lady screamed. Bring her on and let her scream.\"Now- for the positives. Gibson clearly just wanted to write a string of action sequences and techno-babel. Being a computer nerd myself, I found all of that interesting. Towards the end the characters actually have dialog with each other and as things come to a head it actually get's entertaining here and there. Another huge plus is that this book is considered the first true Cyberpunk work and has been heavily mined by Hollywood, Anime and pop-culture in general. Coining phrases like Matrix, Cyberspace, etc. For me, this was probably the first book I ever read just to say I read it. I don't regret it, but believe me, I'm glad it's over because I literally forced myself through it. Just wait for the movie. It'll probably make more sense."

        "user_review": "Context. Sometimes the key to understanding something is context. And never is that more the case than with the bookNeuromancer. Neuromanceris a very famous, genre creating/changing book, winner of many awards. I'm readingNeuromancerfor the first time; while not quite done, I find the story to be decent and the writing to be ok. As just a book that I am reading, I would call it fair. But that is an evaluation without context.Under what context does my evaluation change? Well, one of the first things I noticed when I picked it up is that it was originally published nearly 25 years ago, in 1984. And it is at that point that the context suddenly clicks and becomes crucial.Neuromanceris a book about, in large part, individuals exploring and exploiting cyberspace and, to a lesser extent, aboutartificial intelligence. When this book was written, the vast majority of people did not own a computer; it was just around the time when the idea of a family buying one started to become prevalent, and the computer they could buy did not have a hard drive and probably had no more than 64kb of RAM (the Apple IIe my family got in 1985 was \"expandable\" to 128kb of RAM…more than almost any program we would want to run could possibly need). Pretty much no one had heard of the internet and email was virtually unknown. The World Wide Web and webpages as we think of them today were still about 8 years away (I was reasonably plugged in at the time and I first heard about WWW and html around '92/93…prior to that the internet for most people was email, independent bulletin boards [anyone remember CompuServe?:], anonymous FTP, and Gopher). When one considers what the world was like, what fiction about computers was like, at the time it was written,Neuromancermust have been absolutely stunning. The innovation and direction were ground-breaking in a way that little other fiction has likely been during our lifetime.An analogy would be the movieCitizen Kane.Citizen Kaneis considered by many to be the greatest movie ever made. Sit down and watch it with someone who enjoys movies but has never seen it.Citizen Kaneis a decent film with a decent story, but is hardly a stunning, blow the mind away movie, in any sense. I'm not sure it has aged particularly well, and I suspect a lot of people today find it a rather boring film. But again, that is if we view it without context. Contextually,Citizen Kaneis one of the most influential movies ever made. Many have said, rightfully so, that it not only taught Hollywood how to make movies, it taught the audience how to watch movies.Citizen Kaneuses nonlinear plot and flashbacks. It uses unique camera angles and closeups and shadow, all in ways that were completely innovative and unheard of for the time. Today, we watchCitizen Kaneand it seems sort of ho-hum, because generations of movie makers (and watchers) have been influenced by it. At the timeCitizen Kanewas revolutionary, and it is in that context that its importance and influence are judged.While everything is created in some context, the context is not always critical. Some works are timeless and stand fairly well on their own: I think a book likeThe Count of Monte CristoorThe Hobbitcan largely be enjoyed (or disliked) by someone without appreciation of when and under what circumstances it was written (others will disagree). Other works are best appreciated with respect to context.The Jazz Singeris a rather poor film, but as the first \"talkie\" it killed the silent picture and changed Hollywood.Citizen Kanewas arguably even more revolutionary, although in somewhat subtler ways. And it is with a consideration of context, that the importance and value ofNeuromancercan be judged.I'm not trying to claim thatNeuromanceris as important or ground breaking asCitizen Kane.Neuormancerwas likely not the first novel to explore the themes and concepts that it did, but it popularized a way of thinking about the role and future of computers and computer networks like no other novel has since. The word \"cyberspace\" was popularized by this novel (although original coined by Gibson in an earlier short story) andNeuromancerhas had both direct and indirect influence on all social cybernetworks and games (e.g., World of Warcraft or Second Life). I suspect the book is much easier to read now then it was when written, because so many terms and concepts which were new at the time are now just part of our current culture.If you newly readNeuromancer,you may or may not enjoy it (as I already stated, I'm finding it to be rather middle-of-the-road overall), but you certainly will not understand its importance or influence (for better or worse), without some consideration of context."

        "user_review": "Adapted from ISawLightningFall.blogspot.comThe first time I tried to read Neuromancer, I stopped around page 25.I was about 15 years old and I'd heard it was a classic, a must-read from 1984. So I picked it up and I plowed through the first chapter, scratching my head the whole time. Then I shoved it onto my bookshelf, where it was quickly forgotten. It was a dense, multilayered read, requiring more effort than a hormone-addled adolescent wanted to give. But few years later, I pulled the book down and gave it another chance. This time, William Gibson's dystopic rabbit hole swallowed me whole.Neuromancer is basically a futuristic crime caper. The main character is Case, a burnt-out hacker, a cyberthief. When the book opens, a disgruntled employer has irrevocably destroyed parts of his nervous system with a mycotoxin, meaning he can't jack into the matrix, an abstract representation of earth's computer network. Then he receives a suspiciously sweet offer: A mysterious employer will fix him up if he'll sign on for a special job. He cautiously agrees and finds himself joined by a schizophrenic ex-Special Forces colonel; a perverse performance artist who wrecks havoc with his holographic imaginings; a long-dead mentor whose personality has been encoded as a ROM construct; and a nubile mercenary with silver lenses implanted over her eyes, retractable razors beneath her fingernails and one heckuva chip on her shoulder. Case soon learns that the target he's supposed to crack and his employer and are one and the same -- anartificial intelligencenamed Wintermute.Unlike most crime thrillers and many works of speculative fiction, Neuromancer is interested in a whole lot more that plot development. Gibson famously coined the word \"cyberspace\" and he imagines a world where continents are ruled more by corporations and crime syndicates than nations, where cultural trends both ancient and modern dwell side by side, where high-tech and biotech miracles are as ordinary as air. On one page you'll find a discussion of nerve splicing, on another a description of an open-air market in Istanbul. An African sailor with tribal scars on his face might meet a Japanese corporate drone implanted with microprocessors, the better to measure the mutagen in his bloodstream. When he's not plumbing the future, Gibson dips into weighty themes such as the nature of love, what drives people toward self-destruction and mind/body dualism. It's a rich, heady blend.That complexity translates over to the novel's prose style, which is why I suspect my first effort to read it failed. Gibson peppers his paragraphs with allusions to Asian geography and Rastafarianism, computer programming and corporate finance. He writes about subjects ranging from drug addiction and zero-gravity physics to synesthesia and brutal back-alley violence. And he writes with next to no exposition. You aren't told that Case grew up in the Sprawl, which is the nickname for the Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis, a concreted strip of the Eastern Seaboard, and that he began training in Miami to become a cowboy, which is slang for a cyberspace hacker, and that he was immensely skilled at it, et cetera, et cetera. No, you're thrust right into Case's shoes as he swills rice beer in Japan and pops amphetamines and tries to con the underworld in killing him when his back is turned because he thinks he'll never work again. You have to piece together the rest on your own.Challenging? You bet. But it's electrifying once you get it.I've worked by paperback copy until the spine and cover have split, until the pages have faded like old newsprint. Echoes of its diction sound in my own writing. Thoughts of Chiba City or BAMA pop into my head when I walk through the mall and hear a mélange of voices speaking in Spanish and English and Creole and German. Neuromancer is in me like a tea bag, flavoring my life, and I can't imagine what it would be like if I hadn't pressed on into page 26."

        "user_review": "Towards the end of this novel, the protagonists, Case and Molly, are walking down the rooms of the Villa Straylight, which looks like an abandoned and labyrinthine library or museum, spinning in orbit around the Earth. At one point, Molly passes by the shattered glass pane of Marcel Duchamp's masterpiece,La mariée mise à nu par ses célibataires, même. Gibson's reference to the cubist and dadaist artist, at this point of the novel, might look casual and unsubstantial; but to me, it implies a lot about the whole novel's lineage.InNeuromancer, as in Duchamp, there is this massive display of artefacts and dehumanised techno stuff: on the one hand, computers, artificial intelligence, cyberspace, ROM modules, augmented ninjas, razorblade-fingertips, cyberspies, stealth aircraft, orbital space habitats (Gibson); on the other hand, a urinal, a staircase, a bicycle wheel, a bottle rack, a waterfall and illuminating gas, a box in a suitcase, lumps of sugar in a birdcage (Duchamp).There are also, in contrast to this, many graphic displays of organic and anatomic parts: on the one hand, blood vessels, drug addiction, pancreas and liver, reconstructive surgery, cryonic clones, disembowelled skulls and sexual intercourses (Gibson); on the other, a spread-legged female holding a gas lamp, a descending nude, a stripped bride and a switching from virgin to bride, Mona Lisa's hot arse, and whatever could be exposed at the fountain (Duchamp).The junction of these two contradictory movements, dirty bodies and hallucinatory objects, is precisely what defined surrealism in the 1920s. It is, too, what defined Ridley Scott's masterpiece,Blade Runner(which referencesUn Chien Andalouin subtle ways) and William Gibson's debut novel in the early 1980s — around the same time as Atwood'sHandmaid's Tale, when \"cyberspace\" wasn't even a reality outside of Gibson's imagination. Even the very first sentence, \"The sky above the port was the color of television\" has the flavour of surrealism, redolent of Paul Éluard's \"La Terre est bleue comme une orange\". Gibson's novel is in turn a seminal work, ahead ofGhost in the Shell,Akira,The Matrix,Snow Crash, the whole pop culture movement labelled as \"cyberpunk\", and down to Nolan'sInceptionin recent years, as well as mainstream sheer entertainment works, such asReady Player One.If it were not for the science fiction setting and Gibson's rather outlandish ideas, the overall plot would probably sit alongside the espionage and spy thrillers of John Le Carré, Tom Clancy, Ken Follett or Ian Fleming. However,Neuromancer's messy, fast-paced plotline is a bit secondary and, quite frankly, silly and hard to follow.William Gibson's writing, despite his regular use of slang, jargon and ironical repartee, has a surprising rhythm throughout, a sort of syncopated prosody, ending most of his sections with the recurring line \"He flipped\" or \"He jacked in/out\". His musical style makes Gibson a prominent prose writer, tied with American authors such as Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut (remember \"So it goes\") or Thomas Pynchon — I would even venture to say that Pynchon's last novel,Bleeding Edge, is indebted to Gibson's debut novel."

The plot is very thin and predictable and I felt almost no connection to the characters. It wasn't unenjoyable to read. There was some interesting use of language and it was quite possibly prophetic in its pronouncements of a world wide web that would become the default shared hallucination of the world. So it was interesting in that respect, but I didn't quite feel connected to how the characters moved and interacted in this world. 3.25 stars.\"Cyberspace.

It is a messy concoction thats too cool to let you ever, well, absorb. To allow you time to stop an smell the roses (this would imply having a memorable time with the book). Guess I can see how that was revolutionary, at the time. But today, honey: NO!It is basically this: an over-explanation of location, although the location is never an issue. The theme is comic-book party on uppers (with insipid guests to boot). It is a disdainful William Burroughs wannabe, but the nausea does not come from the prose, but from the implausibility & laughability of plot, characters and \"themes.\""

        "user_review": "I was watching Jeopardy a few weeks ago when I first heard of Gibson (Technology for 200: \"I coined the term 'cyberspace'\") and the next morning on my commute to work I heard another allusion to the Canadian author on NPR. A few days later, someone recommended I readNeuromancerso seeing as the stars were seemingly aligning to place a Gibson novel at the top of my 'to-read' list, I went out and bought this novel. I am glad I did. Not only did it remind me that I needed to read more sci-fi from time to time, but it was just good fun. It recalled my high school days of first watchingGhost in the Shell, orBladerunneror evenCowboy Bebop. WhileNeuromancer, which broughtcyberpunkto the main stream, may have its flaws, it delivers a good punch to the mind and will definitely keep you entertained.Gibson is clearly ahead of his time. As I learned from Jeopardy, Gibson coined the termcyberspacein a short story of his back in the early 80's. He created futures heavily reliant on the internet and virtual reality far before either would be actualized and it is impressive how he wasn't far off the mark. InNeuromancer, which was the first novel to win Science Fiction's triple crown of theHugo, Nebula, and Phillip K Dick awardsin 1984, washed up hacker Case is given a second chance after a double cross lead his former employer to inject a drug that would disable him from ever jacking into cyberspace again. His second chance into cyberspace comes with a job veiled in secrecy involving a powerful AI and some sort of elaborate break-in. Teamed up with a program of a dead friends personality and a mysterious woman named Molly, who Case is able to ride along with seeing the world through her eyes as he can literally hack into her brain and become a passenger in her body (begin mind melt), Case slowly pieces the job together as the danger and stakes rise.It may not come across as the most 'fresh' story, or set of ideas, but that is due to this novel being a major influence on countless books and films to come. Back in 10th grade English, I remember classmates complaining that Shakespeare was riddled with clichés. Our teacher countered this saying that it only seems cliché since Shakespearewas the one who created this cliché in the first place. The same can be said of Gibson andNeuromancer. Here you will find discussion of cyberspace and theMatrix- a full realistic programmed world where the AI program Wintermute often brings Case to have a private discussion, that pop up constantly in later sci-fi works. The animeGhost in the Shellmay have found influences in this work and has several connections, and the filmThe Matrixhas some obvious ties to both of these. It was hard not to just picture the lobby scene from the Matrix when reading Molly's invasion of Sense/Net. This isn't intended to be a rip on the film, seeing as Gibson himself was quoted as saying that The Matrix was \"an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time\" and also called Neo his favorite sci-fi hero ever (Wikipedia as a source doesn't fly in the classroom, but it's always a good one-stop research shop). It is also amusing to note that when Gibson first sawBladerunnerin 1982, he damn near gave up onNeuromancerfiguring his audience would just regard it as a rip-off. Thankfully he finished and received a much better critical reception than he anticipated. It should be interesting when they finally get around to making this into a film (imdb.com claims one is in the works for a late 2012 release, but apparently a film for this has been in some sort of works since the 80's without any camera finally getting the 'record' button pushed) if the general population, especially those who aren't well-read, will cry that it is a cheap Matrix rip-off. That would be some irony. Also, you will find the origins of many band names (the title of part 4 isThe Straylight Runto name one) and other film names (if you shit your pants as a kid toEvent Horizonyou will find its titles origin near the end of the novel).Gibson does an excellent job creating this cyberpunk futuristic world, complete with new drugs and drug addictions, a strange blending of futuristic weapons and old ninja weapons, space stations, weird gravitation, and many others. He completely immerses the reader in his world and does not bother with slowing it down and feeding it to you and instead just keeps ticking off his invented names and ideas and letting the reader put them together as they go. Ice, for example, first caused me to scratch my head and wonder \"what the hell is ice\" before realizing it is a sort of anti-virus firewall of sorts. This technique gave the novel a better feel than others I have read where the author keeps removes the reader from the world to gloat about how creative his ideas for something are by overly describing it and its uses. It is occasionally humorous how his 1980's ideas of the internet come across compared to the actual modern day internet, although his Tron-like virtual world where you immerse yourself into a visual internet seems much more badass than the internet I am looking at right now. As a reader you have to suspend your knowledge ofwhat the actual internet and computers are like to fully appreciate and believe in Gibson's vision, but this is altogether not distracting and can cause some giggles like watching an oldPlanet of the Apesfilm.The characters are a bit flat and Gibson doesn't employ the best use of language, but we are reading sci-fi here, notThe Sound and the Furyso this is forgiven. Also, the ideas are enough to keep your mind working and there are a few mind-bending moments (I loved the concept of The Flatline and when Case sees himself through Molly). The flat characters are forgiven because there is a space station full ofdub-listening, ganja-smoking, shotgun-toting Rastafariansand Gibson's use of dialect for them kept a smile across my face. I fully endorse picking this up despite its flaws. If you were a fan of anime or The Matrix, this will give you that same dorky joy (I don't embrace my dork-joy enough anymore) and you can see the origins of many sci-fi plots and concepts. But don't just take my word for it, I'd recommend reading Mike Sullivan's or K.D.'s reviews (and literally any of their other reviews, always spot-on) andTimealso included this on their \"Top 100 of the century\" list. I will definitely read another of Gibson's books in the future.3.5/5"

So,THREE PEOPLE WHO WILL (PROBABLY) NOT LIKENeuromancerAND THREE PEOPLE WHO (PROBABLY) WILL:THREE PEOPLE WHO WILL (PROBABLY) NOT LIKENeuromancer1. The Reader With Delicate SensibilitiesDoes swearing, violence, lots of sex, and drug use sends a shiver of disgust down your spine? Then this is likely not the book for you. Though it rarely veered into territory that made me uncomfortable,Neuromancerrefuses to be censored and depicts acts of deviancy with unique prose. You're not likely to find stabbings that are \"silicon quick\" or sex and violence described in such vibrant neon hues anywhere else. Yet part of the appeal of this novel is a culture that has been rapidly altered by technology, one that is not so unlike our own present. Things that you might find deviant in this novel are presented as perfectly acceptable within the confines of Gibson's future.2. The Reader Looking For A Casual Sci-Fi NovelNeuromanceris assuredly not a typical science fiction novel, but it is undoubtedly a classic in the field. Gibson rarely leaves space for the reader to catch up to the fast-paced nature of his story, opting instead for repeat, strobe-like, in media res chapters. What a mind Gibson must have to have created a world that isn't easily understandable, but relentlessly believable. Some terms are never explained and the onus is placed on the reader to figure out exactly what has taken place. As I was contemplating how to write the review for this novel, I kept thinking that the exposition is best described as impressionistic. The world may not be described in terms that we all understand, but it surely captures the feeling of living in an extremely strange future.3.The Reader Who Loves Everything to be Neatly Tied UpThough there may be sequels toNeuromancer, I fully plan on treating this like a stand-alone novel. Case, the tale's protagonist, is a hacker in a futuristic world where one connects to the Matrix (think advanced internet, not Wachowoskis) through a port in your skull. Case is cut-off from the Matrix after a hacking deal gone bad, and is made an offer to be restored in exchange for an extremely dangerous hack. Case is surrounded by an eclectic cast of characters who help to peel back the layers of this complicated world. Though the main heist/hacking story is resolved by the end of this novel, there's a lot of high-concept sci-fi that is left up to the reader to consider. If you want a decisive rather than contemplative ending, you should probably avoidNeuromancer.THREE PEOPLE WHO WILL (PROBABLY) LIKENeuromancer1. The High School/University StudentI think almost everyone has to read1984orBrave New Worldas part of Western education. Well, I'd be hard pressed to think of a reason whyNeuromancershouldn't sit alongside them as sci-fi with important messages, and literary depth. Though the world isn't strictly dystopian, the characters are living in a world that is consumed by technology, physical modification, and a wide selection of narcotics. Sound in any way familiar?Neuromancerwas written in a time where the shape of the internet's influence was being contemplated, and where Gibson was allowed to paint a speculative picture of what a world interconnected by technology might look like. This book is rich in its interpretation of how internet culture would develop, and I found it to be oddly accurate in some regards.Neuromanceris the type of book I would have loved to have read when I was in high school, and can imagine animated discussions about it in today's classrooms.2. The Hipster/Punk/Skater/Mom/Dad Looking for Some Cool CredThough there is a lot to be said about the literary and speculative merits ofNeuromancer, it is also undeniably cool. Molly, a street ninja with mirror-eyes and blades under her nails, seems to be an almost archetypal badass. How about the visit to the orbital space station run by Rastafarians, constantly cloaked in ganja smoke? So much of this book reads as instantly iconic, and it is no wonder that it was the first winner of the \"sci-fi triple crown\" (Winner of the Nebula, Hugo, and Phillip K. Dick Awards).Neuromanceris a world that is grimy around the edges, and is all the richer for it. This isn't a shiny-white future that looks like an Apple store, more likeStar Warsin that it is science fiction without all the gloss.3. The Reader Looking For Something A Little DifferentYou'll feel no shame in having readNeuromancer. You might not like the book, but its craft is undeniable. Gibson shaped a world and cast of characters that could have easily filled a 600-page epic, but Gibson instead chose a restrained, tight, slightly confusing, 271-page romp. I was able to appreciate the book for its literary aspirations, the curiosity of an imagined internet-age, but also to sit back and enjoy some foreign imagery and high-stakes action. There are obvious flaws to the novel: it isn't easily understandable, and the prose can seem a bit tedious on occasion. So, it isn't as if I loved this one the whole way through. However, when taken as a whole,Neuromancerprovided an interesting, complicated, and challenging read that I won't soon forget."

It took me forever to read and I took week-long breaks, however, I knew from the very beginning this is definitely not a #dnf!I can't say what the experience is like if you are a sci-fi reader, but for a newbie like me, it is a rollercoaster ride. I spent the first 50 pages in confusion thinking something is wrong with my brain, why don't I understand what this man is talking about?! Then something clicked and I learned to roll with it. Soon enough I felt at home in the Sprawl's techno criminal subculture.Reading this book you will most likely reach the limits of your imagination. This is a world of chartered hovercrafts, space cowboys, simstims, AI constructs, and razorgirls. On top of that, our protagonist spends his days jacked into a cyberspace deck, doing God knows what in the matrix.This book is part of the Sprawl Trilogy and although I need a rest after this one, I already added the other two to my #tbr.I don't do this very often, but here is a plot summary for people who are curious about the book, but not sure if they can handle the techno-punk genre.SPOILER ALERTThe main character, Case is a \"retired\" cybercriminal, a matrix ridin' badass, who gets a second chance at doing what he does best by a mysterious new employer, an AI. With the help of his new partner, Molly, a body-enhanced killer, a stolen software trafficker called Finn, and even the computer program reincarnation of his old mentor, Flatline, aka. Pauley McCoy, he sets out to free Wintermute and Neuromancer, two AIs created by the matriarch of the Tessier-Ashpool business clan who was an AI enthusiast and got killed by her husband for this reason. Their children, Jean and Jane, were cloned many times over, they are on their 8th and 3rd versions, respectively.In the end, 3Jane helps Case and Molly in their quest partly because she is intrigued by her late mother's philosophy, partly because she is bored and wants something to change. No one knows how these freed AIs will change the world."

I'm aware that this is my limitation, although I can't help thinking that some of it is the author's as well. After all, I didn't feel this alienated when I read about Humbert Humbert.2.\t I had to look up the definition of \"cyberpunk\" on Wikipedia.And then, that explained my difficulty getting this book. I can read academic articles. I can read in a foreign language (Hebrew). But much of this book was impenetrable to me. Witness the following randomly chosen paragraph (I simply copied this from the first page I opened up to):\"Cowboys didn't get into simstim, he thought, because it was basically a meat toy. He knew that the trodes he used and the little plastic tiara dangling from a simstim deck were basically the same, and that the cyberspace matrix was actually a drastic simplification of the human sensorium, at least in terms of presentation, but simstim itself struck him as a gratuitous multiplication of flesh input.\"Do you get this? It didn't make any more sense to me in context than it does out of context, because the entire context was more or less written this way. I suppose that's expected for this genre, but I'm just not a fan of this type of writing.3.\tI never finished the book, because writing this review was more fun (see #1 above).And that was when I knew, around p. 55, that it was time to stop reading."

But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. The target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting Earth in service of the sinister Tessier-Ashpool business clan. With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.Hotwired to the leading edges of art and technology,Neuromancerranks with1984andBrave New Worldas one of the century's most potent visions of the future.My Review: The seminal work of cyberpunk, the novel was published in 1984 as a mass-market paperback original. It's the story of a twenty-first century dominated by Japanese corporations, feeding off American talent, and dominating a planet only recently recovered (if one can call it that) from the most recent pandemic as well as a horrific war between the USSR and the USA. So far, Reality 1, Gibson 0...but wait.Molly, Case, and Armitage are a weird little unit, chasing after a huge, game-changing paradigm-shifting score: Access to Wintermute, an AI that a powerful family-controlled corporation has...what, blocked up, imprisoned, how does language cope with this? Even Gibson didn't do so well here. Case, the cyber-cowboy, is in the team because he can jack in to the matrix, do the necessary cybercrime, and find the breadcrumbs that will lead to Wintermute. Murderous Molly is the cyber-enhanced muscle, and Armitage of the shady past is the money channel. Though Molly and Case know he's a front for someone(s) else, things just don't add up in his bio. (They turn out to be right, of course.) In the end, though characters walk away, there are not really any survivors of the battles that they must fight. At least, not ones you'd recognize as such.My teenaged stepson ordered me to read this book in 1987. Tony wasn't given to thundering pronunciamentoes, so I think it was sheer surprise that made me take it from him and read it. As his mother and I were in the process of disentanglement, I was falling in love with someone wildly inappropriate for me (comme d'habitude), and so on and so on, I think I gave it about 30% of my attention. I shall now quote, in its entirety, the thought I had as I finished the book that year: \"*snort*\"You see, I am short on the visionary giftedness tip. The cyberspace that Case inhabits made me roll my eyes, though due to friends in the Austin computer world I got the idea that home computers were going to be huuuge pretty early on. (I chortle now at the level of OOO AAAH we felt when one friend got a 512K hard drive IBM PC!) But Japanese world business dominon? Snort, said I, this time rightly. American innovation remaining preeminent? Snort said I, again correctly. The seeds of destruction weren't hard to see.But cyberspace, said he to the people he talks to in it, that was a big miss. This beautiful Internet thing that allows us who live so far apart to interact and learn to be a community among ourselves, that idea I missed the implications of and I missed the meat (!) of the book therefore.It's an important book, I can finally see only 27-1/2 years later, because it both foresaw and called into being the world we live in now. My previous two-star derisive dismissal is herewith retracted, though I still don't think I'll ever revisit this book. I've been wrong about that before, though....Rant: Certain perfidious people, who shall remain nameless in this text but who answer when the sound \"Stephen Sullivan\" is uttered within their hearing, suggested in an ever-so-innocent, crack-merchantly way that I should mosey over and read a review that this, thisindividualhad written of the book. I, all innocent smiles and dimplings, casually went to the appointed spot and was promptly pushed to the mat by a huge, muscular, testosterone-poisoned review-cum-paean. The imprint of the six, yes six!, stars that theindividualin question had rated the book is still a quarter inch deep on my forehead from being bashed on me multiple times.I warn all who read this: Beware the blandishments of Fanboy Gush, as I now dub the reviewer in question. Persuasive? Huh. I've met boiler-room bond salesmen with lower persuasion quotients. Aggressive? I've escaped being buttonholed by impecunious brothers-in-law in search of loans with greater ease.THE MAN IS A MENACE TO YOUR READING TIME, YOUR BUDGET, AND YOUR PEACE OF MIND.If he can persuade me, a curmudgeonly old man with more books than he will ever have time to read ALREADY, to revisit a book long ago dismissed (however incorrectly and unjustly), I shudder to think what he can do to you.Unfriend him immediately, or suffer the consequences./RantThis work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."

        "user_review": "I'm told this is one of if not THE novel that started the cyberpunk genre. Cyberpunk is defined as telling a story in a futuristic setting where technology has advanced, but so have crime and corruption.Case is a thief. A low-life. He lives in a futuristic and quite depressing because very corrupt law-free zone in Japan. Originally, he had been a talented hacker, stealing to make money. But then he did what many idiotic criminals do: he stole from his own employers. They didn't mind so much the money he had taken but the loss in reputation, so they decided to make an example of him - they damaged his central nervous system so now he's unable to access the \"matrix\" (virtual reality).Naturally, this disabillity is precisely what makes it so easy for an American ex-military person to hire him: all they have to do is offer to cure Case in exchange for his services. Of course he agrees. He's supposed to steal the saved consciousness of a legendary hacker (and Case's mentor).The problem is that Case's new employer has a dark past and there are layers within layers within layers and he probably never imagined the true reason for the heist.As is often the case with cyberpunk novels, I loved the worldbuilding. Everyone can look the way they want to thanks to tech. There's also cryonic preservation and we even get an AI. Not bad for a book written in 1984.I also liked the cyberspace/VRand the dilemma of staying there with the (dead) girlfriend or exiting into the real worldas I often asked myself whose side I'd be on.The ending, though, was a bit weird. I meanthe whole copying Case's consciousness without asking and populating cyberspace that way - probably so Wintermute/Neuromancer wouldn't be so lonely - was unsettling. Just like I wasn't too much a fan ofPauley seemingly still existing after all despite his wish to have his ROM destroyed. I would have much preferred a stronger hint at what to expect fromAlpha Centauriinstead.While considering the time when this was written and that it likely spearheaded this genre, I have read this after many other cyberpunk stories and it might be for that particular reason that I wasn't all THAT impressed.Don't get me wrong, it was a cool story with numerous layers and a healthy portion of action while also giving us wonderful worldbuilding and pretty good characters. Then again, quite a number of characters were also pretty standard (not exactly flat but too mediocre).And the writing itself, the prose, was nothing special. Fun but also simple.Thus, I wouldn't call it world-changing. However, like I hinted at above, it might be because too many used these elements as a template for their stories and I just read the books in the wrong order ... dunno. *shrugs* So 3.5 stars and it's probably actually closer to 3 but acknowledging its place in literary history, I'm rounding up."

Once or twice I went back to reread a bit for example the first appearance of Riviera made no sense to me at all until I discovered what his party trick was. There was plenty of action, a good story and I found the whole thing very readable.For me this was a very well written book with some intriguing and novel ideas, plenty of action and suspense and a satisfactory conclusion. I did however have to read the ending twice. It took me a minute to understand what Gibson was telling me but when I realised what it was I was left happy."

As part of reading my way through the Pop Chart 100 Essential Novels list, I finally made the time to readNeuromancer, another sci-fi classic that has lurked on my TBR pile for years.Neuromanceris probably most famous for introducing the concept of the Matrix and the word \"cyberspace\" into our lexicon. While the cyberspace here is more of a physical representation of the interconnected data—firewalls are literal walls of smooth ice, for example—it is a somewhat prescient depiction of today's interconnected society. The plot revolves around a hacker named Case who's been hired by a mysterious client to infiltrate an AI system. While it's considered the quintessential cyberpunk novel, it read to me more like classic noir detective novels likeThe Maltese FalconorThe Big Sleep.However,Neuromancerjust didn't work for me. The reader is thrown into this story with little explanation of jargon or the relationships between characters. While I enjoyed the noir aspects, many sections of the book are more impressionistic or even hallucinatory. I didn't have any emotional connection to either the characters or the story, and I have no idea what conclusions the reader is supposed to draw. Perhaps the story would be more understandable, and better, on a second reading, but I can't imagine ever choosing to read it again. Ultimately, this feels like the kind of highly influential book whose reputation exceeds its actual readability."

        "user_review": "The thing is I just didn't get it. I like my SF near future and close enough to present day reality for me to be able to translate what we do now into what we're supposed to be doing (or able to do) in the future. If it's too wild, or just too big a leap, my mind doesn't seem to allow me to make the jump.Then there's the language thing. The use of a new vocabulary left me befuddled and confused. I honestly didn't know what was going on most of the time. And when I did glean a bit of the narrative it just seemed to have been too much like hard work to get there. So that's another thing, I like my fiction easy. Well no, not easy but understandable. I've coped with most of Murakami's surreal tales and I love time travel books, so escape from reality isn't a problem for me – in fact it's a joy – but everyday life lived in an environment so alien, so different and (for me) so unbelievable is just a switch-off.A quick synopsis for anyone who hasn't read the book:Case is a hacker who has been 'altered' so he can't hack any more. He lives life as a hustler in Japan until he gets an offer from a mysterious type who offers to restore his hacking ability in exchange for undertaking some work for him. Case is suspicious and, having teamed up with a modified female, he sets out to find out more about the man. The rest (as far as I could tell) was a sort of hardboiled detective tale but set in the netherworld of cyberspace. It also had a touch ofThe Magnificent Sevenabout it. Though, in truth, I gave up at half way – my mind fried by terminology I couldn't comprehend and a story that had jettisoned me and left me behind some time ago.On the up-side, I like Case who I found to be the archetypal street-smart hardass who is on his uppers but has sufficient moral compass to keep him from straying too far from the straight and narrow. I also enjoyed some of the brilliant descriptions – mainly of the cyberspace world – that pepper the book.Not my cup of tea but note my rating simply reflects the fact I didn't finish it."

        "user_review": "This is my third reading ofNeuromancer, the first time was while in my teens decades ago, I hated it then and was not able to read more than 50 pages. The second time was around five years ago, I liked it better then but still found much of it inaccessible. This third reading was inspired byThe Three-Body Problemwhich is only partially a cyberpunk book. I keep coming back to this problematic book not because I love it, but because the story and its iconic status interests me and I really want to \"get it\". I think I have got it now. Mostly.Neuromanceris just about the most divisive classic science fiction book I can think of. Sure, some people do not likeDuneorFoundationbut such \"blasphemers\" are few and far between compared to the opponents ofNeuromancer*. The basic story is not too hard to follow or summarize. Ex-hacker and junkie Henry Dorsett Case is recruited by a mysterious sexy badass woman called Molly Millions on behalf of an even more mysterious man called Armitage to do some unspecified hacking for him. Previously Case was injected with a mycotoxin that damaged his nervous system and disabled his ability to plug (jack) into cyberspace. Clearly hacking entirely via keyboard and a mouse is no longer an option. Armitage has the means to repair the mycotoxin damage so Case – who is desperate to get back into cyberspace where he belongs – quickly agree to take the job. The job of course turns out to be difficult and deadly, involving AIs, a space habitat, the Turing Police, killer robots, VR and even a ninja!If this sounds like a hoot, it is, the difficulty lies in deciphering William Gibson's writing. Thankfully his writing is not the kind of \"stream of consciousness\" post-modern style that you find in the likes ofUlyssesorMrs. Dalloway, the punctuations and the quotation marks are all in place. Gibson's prose style is fairly readable but it is stuffed to the gills with neologisms, jargons and slangs; he also has a penchant for employing techy and hip metaphors. His dialogue is much more problematical. Beside the neologisms and slangs most of his characters speak in choppy and terse sentences where pronouns and prepositions are often deemed unnecessary. The heavily accented dialogs from a couple of Rastafarian characters serve to exacerbate the comprehension issues. While the basic plot is fairly simple the twists and turns of the storyline can seem quite convoluted and the reader needs to maintain focus at all time and not start wandering about what to have for lunch etc.It is a shame thatNeuromanceris quite difficult (for some) to access because there is fast paced thrilling adventure buried underneath the opaque language. The world building is also excellent from the grimy dystopian Chiba city at the beginning of the book (where the sky is famously\"the color of television, tuned to a dead channel\"), to the Sprawl city, the Freeside luxurious space habitat and the weird Villa Straylight mansion. The cyberspace of course is the most imaginative location (if you can call it that) in the book. Sometime it seems to look like a place pixelized geometrical shapes, other times it is in full VR mode and looks just like reality. The scenes inside cyberspace are some of my favorites, though the word cyberspace itself seems oddly quaint these days.Gibson also did a good job developing (and designing) the main characters. Case is damaged and flawed but also complex and sympathetic. Molly is a wonderfully vivid creation, with her numerous implants, her cybernetic eyes and deadly assassination skills. Sheliterallylights up every scene she is in. The AI characters are also great but I will leave you to discover them for yourself. There is even a smidgen of an unrequited love story in there somewhere.Molly Millions byAspectusFuturusSome people take toNeuromancerlike ducks to water, I envy them, but if you are not so adaptable you may want to avail yourself to online sources like thechapter by chapter guide on shmoop.com. It is extremely helpful but I find their feeble attempts at humour a little grating (I much prefer Sparknotes.com but they don't cover this book).So with plenty of help at hand there is no reason why you should not read this book if you are interested. This is a difficult book to rate in quantitative terms, I will break the process down into components:For the story – 5 starsFor the world building – 5 starsFor the characters – 4 starsFor the prose and dialogue – 2.5 stars (2 to 3 really)=average(story:world:characters:prose) = 4.125 stars!I will probably read the rest of theSprawl series, you will be the first to know!___________________________* I don't actually have any statistical proof of this, so consider this my hypothesis if you disagree."

His surroundings are\"a field of data, the way the matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish cell specialties...totally engaged but set apart from it all, and all around you the dance of biz, information interacting, data made flesh in the mazes of the black market...\"The experience of cyberspace is\"a consensual hallucination...a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data.\"For all of the social applications that would eventuate on the internet, Gibson focusses on business and the market (especially the black market). Where there is knowledge, there are insiders. And therefore, crime.Still, everywhere, Case sees a sensorium of\"symbols, figures, faces, a blurred, fragmented mandala of visual information...\"The language is as fractal as it is alliterative:\"It flowed, flowered for him, [a] fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to infinity.\"Molly is a fellow professional, a razorgirl, someone Case gets to share these sensations with, and perhaps even sometimes to experience a\"mutual grunt of unity\".The novel is basically an action story in which the two use a firmware construct and a Chinese virus program to penetrate deep into the matrix on a secret, but illicit, mission to correct the\"Gothic folly\"of the Villa Straylight (a manifestation of the multi-national zaibatsu or corporate business entity, Tessier-Ashpool), their accomplices, quasi-terrorist, dub-loving Rastafarian Panther Moderns.The folly, a demon which at first has no name, turns out to be adialectical conflictbetween two segments of cyberspace, Wintermute and the Neuromancer.Like Apollo and Dionysius, each is unknowingly necessary to the survival of the other, but can they be synthesised, can they be united, can they become one, can they eventually go by one name? And what of Case and Miss Linda Lee, or Case and Molly?These are questions best answered by the pleasure of reading this pivotal work of cyberfiction.The prose style iseconomical, but filmic.It's a tragedy that this novel hasn't yet been made into a big-budget film that does justice to its imaginative scope.

What impact have other media had on your sensibility?\"William Gibson:\"Probably more than fiction. The trouble with \"influence\" questions is that they're usually framed to encourage you to talk about your writing as if you grew up in a world circumscribed by books. I've been influenced by Lou Reed, for instance, as much as I've been by any \"fiction\" writer.

        "user_review": "the following is aReverse Exquisite Corpse Review, brought to you by the good folks atSci Fi Aficionados._____________________I first read Neuromancer about 20 years ago. Writing with strokes instead of details is an interesting way to describe Gibson's writing. That's how I feel about some of the performance art I saw in my art school days. The strokes were far too numerous. I found it impossible to tell what was detail, what was colour, what was clue. I get bored with things being laid out to me, writers that paint words with strokes appeal to me more than writers who lay everything out. A writing style is like food, different people have different tastes. It's not that I don't like Neuromancer, just that it leaves me entirely cold. One of my professors said that if you are used to narrative writers such as Stephen King, you would have a particularly hard time with Gibson's writing style. I loved the imagery that opens up the novel, Neuromancer is one of those books that you have to reread to catch everything.Just finished rereading Neuromancer, even better then I remembered.i'm curious if hollywood will go the Battle Royale route and keep all the graphic kid violence, or if they'll somehow soften it.It will be very interesting to see how they deal with the graphic violence when the movie comes out next year. I'll be reading the follow ups at some point.I was just thinking the other day how kids in high school for the most part have always have had the world wide web around and as such, they're both a little \"warmer\" or \"more human\". It's like eating junk food.I usually love books like Neuromancer, but it just didn't work for me. I don't get it. I think it's my mood. I do enjoy complex books but I think Neuromancer was just out of my reach. I would say a person of the current internet generation would have written the book coldly and less philosophically. I also had trouble understanding some of the goings in the novel, which is partly a result of my being slow, lol, but I think that Gibson is playing with perception on purpose and leaving some subtle hints along the way.He was obviously mad and dangerous, especially since Molly found his daughter's body, and she killed him. When Molly encountered him, he had raped (?) and murdered one of his clone daughters (not 3Jane), and was in the middle of trying to commit suicide via pills and booze. Ashpool is crazy. Ashpool was incensed when he found out because he likes the status quo, and strangled her. It would be a collective consciousness, without the pain and loneliness of the individual. The mother came up with the plan to make the family's consciousness immortal via the AI. And then 3Jane in turn tried to kill her father who was already trying to commit suicide?I can imagine those guys in the most sexually deviant scenes. That's why Neuromancer is so great. I like books that make me work for it.I think when you know that the whole plot is actually driven by an AI whose motive is to unite with its twin, Neuromancer, then you'll understand the book better. Note how it got Case to hate and Molly to hate, and using each individual's strong hot buttons and desires to manipulate him/her. But get this, it was all planned out by Wintermute, the AI, who used human psychology to get them to do what it wants. Unfortunately, Riviera is a rogue sociopath, which Wintermute anticipates, and lets Riviera knows about Molly's past, which tempts Riviera to mess with Molly, which causes Molly to hate him enough to destroy him. Riviera was used by Wintermute to influence the Tessier-Ashpools family to get into the compound via his special holographic ability. I know Molly hated him for the performance he did of her but why did he hate her in turn? What made Riviera do that?That was my biggest problem with the book: trying to figure out why the characters were acting the way they did. I need to reread this book again to get all the nuances.It's hard to tell who is the good or bad guy, especially since the opposing sides also work with each other. Does this explain anything, or does it make it more confusing? Riviera is a sociopath who decided at the last minute to double-cross Armitage. Riviera was working for Armitage, who is actually Colonel Corto, who was actually brainwashed into thinking he's Armitage by Wintermute, whose main purpose was to connect with its counterpart, Neuromancer, to become whole.Would someone please explain to me whose side Riviera was on? I'm so confused... I think he stole plot elements from his earlier work... Gibson is obviously doing that and able to draw from noir aesthetics largely to differentiate himself from more, should I say space oriented scifi stories, towards gritty urban stories that focus on modern technology, but also show how modern cities still create some of the same concerns that existed when someone like Chandler was writing.I think it's too dreamy and stream of conscious for me. While reading this book, I feel like I'm hanging on by my fingertips, just on the edge of really understanding what's going on. I appreciate that it is a groundbreaking book and the authors creativity but it was still a struggle to 'get into' it in the first half. The book certainly improved as it went on but it wasn't as amazing to me as others have found it.The women are generic, Linda and Molly, maybe symptomatic of the culture of the world where there's no love and everyone is a whore for someone. It's a bit bizarre though because they're both pretty unique, Linda the sad burnout and Molly has freakin' implanted sunglasses and auto-nails! i'm like WHAT? i do not get this book at all, what's going on, it really is challenging me with every sentence!I am about halfway through and feel like everytime I read it's just an adrenaline rush... This book was like a beacon in the bleak and shallow suburbia I instinctually loathed and was desperately searching for a way out of. I was entranced from the first sentence to the last;dark but also excitedly looking forward as well,It's amazing how much imagery Gibson can pack into one sentence.One of the things that stands out for me early on in the novel is its construction and the way the various plot threads came together, but the constant dystopian world view, was terribly depressing. Surely our science and tech. can bring us more than greed and misery. This is quite dark! Too dark for my tastes... not a lot of love for this book from me, I'm afraid.I love the first line to this book.I'm going to try to start it tonight, too. I'm starting this tonight. I started this last night. I've been wanting to read this one for some time now."

Μπροστά από την εποχή του και απόλυτα σύγχρονο σήμερα, θα μου άρεσε πολύ να το δω και στον κινηματογράφο (ή την τηλεόραση).Γλαφυρές περιγραφές του μέλλοντος και εντελώς στο κλίμα του Ντικ ή του Ασίμοφ, μου άρεσε πάρα πολύ. Ομολογώ όμως ότι όλα αυτά τα κλασικά βιβλία σε κάποιο σημείο με κουράζουν, εξ'ου και τα 4 αστέρια αντί για 5. Επίσης, δεν μπόρεσα να δεθώ με τους ήρωες (νομίζω ότι όλοι τους ήταν μεγάλα @ρχίδι@ και τους άξιζαν όσα τράβηξαν - όσο μπόρεσαν βέβαια να καταλάβουν τι έπαθαν!!!!)Και μιας και το ανέφερα, θα μου άρεσε να ακούσω τη γνώμη σας για το πόσο εκπαιδευμένος πρέπει να είναι ο αναγνώστης για να διαβάσει κλασικά βιβλία sci-fi. Νομίζω ότι ένας σύγχρονος έφηβος δύσκολα θα τα αντιλαμβανόταν στην πλήρη τους διάσταση. Ως φανατική του fantasy και του fiction σε κάθε του μορφή, νομίζω ότι τα κλασικά βιβλία του είδους είναι άκρως πολιτικά και κοινωνικά και μπορούν να αναλυθούν σε μεγάλο βάθος."

Cuando se escribió la gente tenía no solo más tiempo para todo, en consecuencia se tenia más paciencia y se esperaba con más gusto,hasta dar con la información y los secretos del final.Hoy día está uno obligado a escribir con más agilidad, y debe ser más... escueto?De todas formas, este libro ha representado sin duda una fuente de inspiración para cualquier escritor a lo largo de su existencia.

        "user_review": "NO SPOILERSThis is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Gibson has a real gift.Think of Blade Runner - the movie with Harrison Ford. This book has the same kind of slick, urban, grimy, futuristic feel to it. It has aged wonderfully. Written in 1983, it has done nothing to date itself and still feels fresh and new and possible, even now....Case is a hacker, it's what he lives for - being jacked in and connected to the matrix. But he loses that ability when he tries to cheat his employers and as a punishment they poison him so that he's unable to hook into the mainframe - to him this is worse than death. So he's been eking out a living - if you could call it living - in filthy Chiba, Japan, a wretched hive of scum and villainy. He's killed three people, two men and a woman, and his life is a drugged haze of barely disguised suicidal tendencies. He's 24 and he's an old man - his life is basically over.Then some strange ex-military man shows up and tells Case he can repair him - for a price. Even though he knows it's dangerous and he knows the man will probably backstab him, blackmail him, and use him ruthlessly - Case can't resist the chance to be connected to the Net again. It's the only thing that makes him feel alive and powerful. Besides, there's this woman.......I went into this novel completely blind and very unsure about how I would like it. I don't really think of myself as a hard science-fiction kind of person. Actually, I don't think of myself as a science fiction fan at all - which is complete bullcrap, I totally am, and I should seek more of it out, because apparently I love the stuff - as my reviews will testify to. o.O Strange and exciting to find out new things about yourself...I digress. Anyway, the novel was wonderful. Case is EXACTLY the kind of guy I adore. Chill, calm, observant, smart, takes-life-as-it-comes, type-b personality type of man that makes me very excited. :) This isn't to say he's passive or weak - far from it - but a kind of roll-with-the-punches, shit-happens, wait-and-see, patient, no-temper, kind of guy.If it wasn't for his serious drug addiction, I would be ga-ga over this man.I love how he treats women and I love how he reacts to life and the problems that come his way. I really enjoyed being in his head and reading his story and seeing what happened to him....I also really appreciate Gibson not trying to write from a female perspective ever in this book. I personally think it would have been a disaster and sometimes I really am grateful when a male author decides to stick with what he knows. Not to say a man can't write a woman well - but I really wanted to enjoy every minute of this book and I didn't want to see Gibson screw it up. So.What else?...Oh, yes, Case's love interest - Molly. I really liked her. She's an ex-prostitute, and ex-prostitutes and prostitutes in general (while very popular characters in fiction) are really difficult to write - but I thought Gibson did a stellar job here. Her difficult, painful past is not dwelled on, but it is mentioned and treated respectfully. They didn't make too big a deal out of her past, and I liked that. Also, she turns her money from tricking into becoming a badass lethal assassin and I really liked that. She was very strong, confident, self-assured, and bold - but in no way crass or easy or cheap or dirty. She's also not a caricature of a 'kickass babe.' Gibson did a great job of making her a real person with real feelings and he also made her a strong character - mentally and physically. I enjoyed it immensely. :)Molly makes her attraction to Case obvious and she chooses to have sex with him at the earliest opportunity. I was nervous about that, and worried about Case. After all, Molly is working for the man who is helping/blackmailing Case and I was unsure about her motives for sleeping with him. Not because I think the blackmailer is ordering/asking Molly to have sex with Case - those days are long over for her and she's never going back - but because often times a woman who is in the Life or used to be in the Life has sex with a man as a kind of power-thing. If she can get the man to have sex with her, she's already won. Having carnal knowledge of the him makes him 'not a person, but just a man' in her eyes. Now that she's seen him at his most vulnerable and also knows that she makes his cock twitch - she can dismiss him as a person and also lose any fear she has of him, because he's already in a way submitted to her (by submitted, I don't mean 'submissive,' he could be a woman-beating rapist asshole but still the sex gives her a tool to use, see?). Do you understand? It's a common tactic that women who have lived very difficult lives and seen terrible things and are ancient in spirit if not in body use to make themselves a little more sure, a little less afraid, and gives them a little more control over a situation they may be unsure about.So, I was afraid that THIS was why Molly was having sex with Case right away, in order to get a read on him and get a hold on him. But it wasn't - she was really interested in him as a person and she made an excellent choice in a partner, in my opinion.That leads me to the fact that Case makes...not exactly bad...but 'iffy' sexual decisions throughout this book. It's as if, when presented by any reasonably attractive female who is offering to fuck him, he is quite unable to say 'no.' I really, really hope this is not an accurate portrayal of SINGLE (not married/partnered) men - feel free to chime in, guys - because I've seen it in about a billion books that are written by MEN. I've talked with this to some of my male friends, and have gotten no clear answer. Even when the main character of these books is being offered sex from a female who might have a desire to kill them/hurt them/blackmail them/steal from them/spy on them, etc. etc. in other words, IT MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST IDEA TO GO TO BED WITH HER, the men always, always, and without fail - choose sex. o.O This is baffling to me on so many levels. Are guys really this much of a slave to their own dicks? I genuinely want to know. Because their stupidity and blatant willingness to disregard any negative consequences makes me fret and scold and worry. I'm yelling at the book, \"Don't sleep with her, you moron!!!\" But of course, the man never listens to me.ANYWAY. Sleeping with Case was a super-good idea on Molly's part - no stupidity there - there's absolutely no scenario in which having sex with him would not give her some sort of benefits or advantages. And I (and Molly) was really grateful that they were sexually and ...kind of romantically... involved when Case got his powers to \"jack in\" again. Because they set her up with a port that allows him to see through her eyes and feel what she feels (he can't talk to her or control her, just observe and feel and hear) and the fact that she's in his bed regularly gives them a bit more of an equal footing. And it means someone she trusts and likes is in her head - not some stranger or a sicko. I usually hate mind-invasion scenarios with a passion (paranormal romance authors, I'm looking at YOU) but here it not only works but doesn't leave me feeling the least bit slimy or unsure. Like I said before, Case is exactly the kind of man I trust and end up falling in love with - I was NEVER worried he'd hurt Molly in any way or take advantage of her.I love the way he treats Molly, he's there for her and he doesn't expect or demand anything from her, and he takes her as she is, and he takes whatever she's willing to give him but he doesn't push, and he doesn't try to own her or possess her or control her in any way. He's just an amazing guy and my heart was melting all over the place. :)...I also liked how he was living this numb, zombie-like, drug-fueled life until this man came and gave his life a purpose again. Case is FEELING again, for the first time in about two years, and it's fun to see him work it out in his mind and experience emotions again. Molly is good for him, the adventure is good for him, getting hooked into the mainframe again is good for him, and even the anger and rage he feels towards certain 'bad guys' in the book is good for him. It's like seeing him wake up or come alive and it's good reading.....I liked the Jamaican character, Maelcum, and his slang and attitude throughout the book....After reading a slew of reviews on GR, I have to say that yes, sometimes his writing is a little challenging or hard to follow. But I just relaxed and went with the flow and it all worked out. I find that trusting the author and letting go a bit really helps especially with the harder science-fiction. I was completely satisfied with this book - not frustrated or lost. But then again, I didn't try to fight it....Another thing that I think is funny after reading all these GR reviews is that I completely focused on the human relationships in this book and focused very little on the technology and cyber-talk. :) Those are my priorities in a book though - how are people loving, hating, interacting, and what are they feeling? So that's what my reviews always end up centering on. I could care less about technology or the future or Cyberdyne Systems or whatever - give me the human element and I'm happy....Tl;dr - A surprisingly human, enchanting novel with gorgeous writing dripping from every page. I'd recommend it. :)"

        "user_review": "I've never dwelt over a set of 200 bound pages with as much joy and relish as I have withTo the Lighthouse. I can say without reservation, that this is some of the most incredible writing I've ever come across and I'm absolutely baffled as to how Woolf pulled it off. So much of the prose was redolent of an abstract surrealist film, such were the clarity and preciseness of its images. At a certain point Woolf describes an idea entering a character's mind as a drop of ink diffusing in a beaker of water. I left several exclamation points and expressions of pure joy among the marginalia of my copy. I have never experienced such a strange brew of images and ideas that whirl around mere words of a novel, all of which has incited such excitement in me, as if some beautiful and aching aspect of human experience has been solidified on paper that will never be as perfect as it is here.This book bounces back and forth between philosophy, psychology and fictionalized story telling in such an interweaving of narrative and personal reflection that it may be difficult to discern who is thinking what and which thoughts are the result of whom. This is especially predominant in the opening section, when Woolf just shoves you into the churning waters of her prose and doesn't throw you a life raft until 45 pages in. The is intentional however, because the book is preoccupied with consciousness at its most mercurial. If at any time, the prose is lucid and clear, it is sure to take a turn for the chaotic within a few pages. There is so much attention given to each individual's neuroses and preoccupations that they are often magnified beyond your typical day to day worries. The sights are bright and irritating; the sounds are cacophonous; and the emotional cues between each character, the ones that are often subtle and implicit in everyday interaction, are rendered as if each character holds equal parts pure malice and enthralling love that threatens to burst open at any second. I thought about highly sensitive people; I thought of those with autism that experience overwhelming intensity from their sensual perception. I thought of all of those that are under bombardment from the outer world, tingling in its euphoric highs and devastating lows. For some, it may seem as though Woolf overly dramatizes experience, but what she really does is puts her character through life at its most intense and acute. The lives of the characters are so rich in emotion that dipping into their world, for mere pages at a time, is like taking a giant bump of the pure stuff, getting tweaked on all the unbelievable wonder that is conscious experience. I thought of Jeff Mangum's infamous lyric,how strange it is to be anything at all.I was fortunate enough to have already readThe Waves—a book quite similar in its themes and images—in a classroom setting with a brilliant professor. It allowed me a way intoLighthousethat I might not have had otherwise. If it wasn't for this frame of reading, I may have been a little too overwhelmed by the non-stop poetic bombardment. So, I will say that my previous experience with Woolf helped tremendously. I have no doubt that anyone who would pick up this book would be blown away by it, but without certain perquisites, it could be a book to throw across the room out of bewilderment. It can be tough. It can be verbose. But it is undoubtably one of the best books I've read this year.During her time as a writer, Woolf was quite invested in the scientific theories of her day. There are, apparently, a lot of her own personal writing that spoke highly of her research into the area and all of the scientific advances being made at the turn of the century, a time heralded by the legendary Charles Darwin. Woolf's focus wasn't necessarily on natural selection—although its influence is present—but on the theories and writings surrounding thermodynamics. Although I'm woefully unqualified to talk about the finer points of thermodynamics, what's important for reading Woolf, is the idea of the conservation of energy, moreover, the fact that matter is never lost. It is continually recycled and that all of our world is a constant fluctuation of heat and matter, moving in and out of different systems—including that oh so special system called human beings.Although, ostensibly our experience of the world tells us that we are one solidified unit of matter, always held together in the perfected feeling of selfness and oneness that is our day to day life, the truth couldn't be any further from that. Woolf seemed particularly haunted by the idea that what seemed to be a solidified conscious experience was actually a continual fluctuation of matter, on a physical level, and the consequential thoughts, worries and sensual bombardment, on the experiential level. These new ideas destabilized previous notions about our awareness of the world as the absolute avenue to truth and the reality of this world. Thus, it is in this tension that the characters ofTo the Lighthousefind themselves in. They are obsessed with creating still images out of the cacophony of a thermodynamic universe, trying to cling to old notions of a person still being that solidified center of the world. A character will revel in the beauty and wonderment of a single moment, only to have it slip away from them and be washed away in the tumultuous seas of conscious experience. Although our minds create perfected still images out of the constant transformation of matter around, these still images skip away into the past before they can be fully grasped, fully made whole:\"With her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked, and then, as she moved and took Minta's arm and left the room, it changed, shaped itself differently; it had become, she knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder, already the past\"But more than any lofty philosophical or scientific conceits, this book is achingly beautiful. Never for a moment does the specifics of the scientific theory engulf the work. Instead it remains above the surface, leaving its impact upon you emotionally. The book is wrought with beautiful feeling and what could possibly make this better than the work of Joyce, for example is that it never leaves one with a cold intellectual shoulder or the folded-arm distance of an extravagant feat of technical writing skill. Woolf goes for the gut.And even if you are completed uninterested in the finer points of Woolf's overall conceit, you can still appreciate the beauty of the titular image—the lighthouse. I was particularly moved by all of Woolf's images of water as a stand in for conscious experience in all its tumultuous churning; and the fact that a lighthouse is the tall solidified object which brings ships lost at sea back to solid ground; and the fact that this lighthouse is what the characters hang all their hopes and desires upon; and the fact that we, the reader, must sail through all that thick prose to get to the promised reward at the end,The lighthouse, for there it was."

        "user_review": "I think this book is Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, not The Waves as some critics say. What is it about? It's about life. The first half is about two days of life; the second half, set ten years later, is largely about death. In the Intro by Eudora Welty she says that in the novel \"reality looms\" but \"Love indeed pervades the whole novel.\"The lighthouse of the book is Godrevy near St. Ives in Cornwall (where the author actually summered). The main character is a beautiful woman \"in full,\" her eight children and husband and guests gathered around her at a summer vacation cottage. Fourteen people in all at dinner, one a scholar friend of her husband who is in love with her, plus cook and maids.At the dinner she worries \"Nothing seems to have merged. They all sat separate. And the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her.\"She's hosts a successful dinner despite numerous minor aggravations and interruptions by the cooks and problem with the food. The meal is her masterpiece, the epitome of her happiness. She delights in matchmaking.Her husband, an academic, is withdrawn, conceited, stingy, in his praise of the children. He holds it over their heads about how the weather will be bad so they won't be able to take a boat trip to the lighthouse. He's more concerned with how the future will view his academic work than he is with the present. Yet, with everyone else to take it out on, he seems happier than his wife: \"Less exposed to human worries…He always had his work to fall back on.\"Some passages I liked:At the dinner a young woman learns about her 'golden haze.' \"Sometimes she had it; sometimes not. She never knew why it came or why it went, or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her.\"\"What was the meaning of life? That was all – a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come.\"\" - no she thought, one could say nothing to nobody. The urgency of the moment always missed its mark. Words fluttered sideways and struck the object too low.\"There is an ungainly female friend who paints. She smarts from a remark by a male friend: \"Women can't write, women can't paint…\" After several repetitions of this in her mind in the book, by the end of the novel she is adding \"…not so much that he believed it, as that for some odd reason he wished it?\"What author ever asked this question (below) before?\"How then did it work out, all of this? How did one judge people, think of them? How did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt, or disliking? And to those words, what meaning attached, after all?\"A beautiful classic, of course. I read this years ago when I was too young to appreciate it. I'm adding it to my favorites.top photo: Godrevy lighthouse; view from St. Ives, Cornwall, from geograph.org.uk.bottom: Talland House, St. Ives, Woolf's vacation home as a child, from Wikipedia"

Favourite Books read in 2021The Idiot's Guide to reading Virginia Woolf To The Lighthouse or I am not that smart to write a serious review.If you would answer with \"Me\" at the famous question \"Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" than this short guide is for you. Here are my steps to finally conquer one of the most celebrated and feared authors of the English canon.Step 1. Choose one of her novels and start reading. No procrastination for years and years. I added To The Lighthouse to my shelves in 2014 and I could not gathered the courage to start the novel until now. What changed? A discussion about her genius on Zoom.Step 2. Do not fall asleep and carry on even if after the first 25 pages or so you have no idea what the plot is about and who is talking.Step 3: Read the synopsis first. It helps knowing who are the characters and what (little) happens to whom. The stream of consciousness type of writing jumps from one character to the other and back to an omniscient narrator with no warning. A bit of reading about the themes also helps. Nothing happens and everything happens. It is a novel about suppressed feelings, about women's condition, about life, death and much more. It is a book about the subtleties of life, about what is not said but felt.Step 4: Listened to the book if you can/ like. Juliet Stevenson has the perfect voice and pacing. She saved me with Madam Bovary a few months ago so I already knew her narration will be perfect.Step 5 and the most important one. Let it Go as the famous song says. You might keep asking yourself, as all the characters of the novel do, \"What it all means\". Don't. Just let the writing flow, envelope your senses and seduce you. Let go of the need for control and to be able to understand everything. I understood more and followed better when I stopped fighting.The novel was beautiful, I can't find the words to explain why. I am truly happy I can now say that I am not longer afraid of Virginia Woolf.\"What is the meaning of life? That was all- a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years, the great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.\""

        "user_review": "The lighthouse is out there, it's eye caressing our struggles with cold indifference. We can beat against the tides in pursuit, but will we ever reach it? Does it even matter, and is it even attainable? If we only look to that spot on the horizon we miss the love around us, miss those gasping for our love and friendship, miss the callouses born in dedicated strife rowing us towards the end. Like in all things, it is the journey that matters, not the destination. Futility can be beautiful, especially when we don't give up on plunging our oars against it and making our place in a world destined to end in a .... flash.....'…for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets, nothing that could be written in any language known to men, but intimacy itself, which is knowledge…'To enter within the pages of Woolf's 1927 masterpiece,To the Lighthouse, is to dive headlong into a maelstrom of vivid perspectives and flawless prose. Few authors are able to achieve the vast scope of human emotions and frustrations as of this novel, let alone accomplish such a task in the mere 209pgs Woolf offers. Flowing to the breezy soundtrack of waves breaking upon the shoreline,To the Lighthouseinvestigates the frailties of life and human relationships in breathtaking prose through the minds and hearts of Woolf's characters as they struggle to affect a state of permanence within an ever-changing ephemeral existence.Reading Woolf is like reading an extended prose poem. Each word shimmers from the page as every sentence illuminates the deep caverns of the heart. She accentuates her themes through carefully chosen imagery and metaphors, or constantly alluding to the passage of time themes through metaphors of fraying draperies and aging furniture and keeping the focus on the island setting through descriptions such as 'bitter waves of despair'. The notion of each person as an island plays a major role in the novel. The waves continuously crash on shore much like the collision of characters as they interact and attempt to understand one another. These repetitions of ideas and symbols are used through this novel as a method of reinforcing them. Similarly, the characters often repeat their own beliefs, much like a mantra, to help reassure themselves of who they are.Woolf effectively utilizes her own stream-of-consciousness style to tell her story, examining each characters unique perspectives and feelings of one another that culminate to form a tragically beautiful portrait of the human condition. Unlike the stream-of-consciousness technique employed by others such asJames JoyceorWilliam Faulkner, Woolf retains a consistence prose style, being more an observer of the inner-workings of each character instead of melding with their consciousness and writing in their own words. While this may seem a cop-out to some, it felt actually beneficial to the structure of this novel, such as allowing Woolf to seamlessly transition from character to character. This also was in keeping with the 'person as an island' theme since we could only observe through an authorial perspective and never truly know commune with the character, leaving the reader as just another wave crashing upon the shoreline of their consciousness. Late in the novel, Lily ponders over the power of narrating what one thinks a person is like as a method of understanding them: 'this making up scenes about them, is what we call \"knowing\" people, \"thinking\" of them, \"being fond\" of them!' There are several metafictional moments such as this within the novel that justify Woolf's stylistic choices. Woolf's decision to maintain a constant narration makes the book 'about' perspectives instead of 'constructed out of' perspectives.Human interaction is the crux of this novel, and also one of its saddest messages. These characters interact daily and are under the constant scrutiny of one another, yet, try as they might, they can never truly understand each other. 'She would never know him. He would never know her. Human relations were all like that, she thought, and the worst were between men and women'. They all try to leave their impressions upon one another but, at the end of the day, are still only left with their perspective and opinion of the others instead of the unity and knowledge of who their contemporaries truly are inside and what motivates their actions. They are forever separated by the fact that souls cannot ever meld and become one. The real tragedy is that these characters, while desiring to understand and be understood, more often than not hurt one another, often due to fear and insecurity, through their attempts of reaching into the others soul. Mr. Ramsey, while being exceptionally needy of praise and security, keeps his family at arms length through his neediness while resenting them and wishing they would leave him be: 'he would have written better books if he had not married'.These characters reach out to one another as if to a life raft, they need something to cling to and bind them with the present. Each character in their own way, be it Mr. Ramsey's philosophy, Mr. Carmichael's poetry, Lily's paintings or Mrs. Ramsey's guiding hand, attempt to leave their permanent scar on the face of eternity. Mrs. Ramsey in particular fears death and the unstoppable change that pushes us forward towards the grave. 'A scene that was vanishing even as she looked…it shaped itself differently; it had become, she knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder, already the past'. She watches in horror as time slips by, firmly believing nothing good can come with the future and goes so far as to cover up Deaths bleak head in the form of a boars skull that hangs on her children's walls. 'With her mind she had already seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice but suffering, death, the poor. There was no treachery too base fir the world to commit… No happiness lasted'. No matter what, time will pass us all by, like the lighthouse beam, illuminating us and calling us up from the dark for one brief moment, and then passing on again to leave us formless in the dark. If is fitting, given the fears of death and time passing, that death comes in this novel swiftly and suddenly. There is no telling when the beam of life will be gone, no preparations can be made, and we must deal with it. Such is existence. These fears can only be subsided, our lives given meaning, if we can reach each other, understand and love each other, thereby existing forever in memory and framed by love in the hearts of those we knew.This novel takes much inspiration from Woolf's own life (Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey being based on Virginia's own parents, making this an elegy to her own mother as well as an elegy to Mrs. R) and doubly serves as a cutting commentary on the literary world in which Woolf was immersed. Woolf set out to oppose the obdurate male society that dominated the literary scene, Tansley's words to Lily of 'women can't paint, women can't write' echoing a stereotype that Woolf would have had to combat her whole life. Woolf combats the patriarchy through this novel, creating a sleek, short masterpiece as opposed to the behemoth (but equally amazing)Ulysses, filled with attacks on the 'masculine intelligence' and making parody of the male opinions on women. Often the reader is given the opinion though a male perspective that 'women made civilization impossible with all their \"charm\", all their \"silliness\"…', yet these same men crave the attention and affection of Mrs. Ramsey – they fly into an anxious fit without the reassurance of the women. They spend their time thinking lofty thoughts, but it is the women that keep order. Mrs. Ramsey despises such masculine activities as hunting and is the head of the household and the keeper of peace, yet she still reads as a bit of a cautionary tale. She still succumbs to the gender roles expected of her, such as being submissive to Mr. Ramsey and playing matchmaker – although this serves more as her attempt to maintain control over life than actually falling into stereotypes. Lily is therefor given as the ideal, the one who can press on despite naysayers like Tansley, be a self-sustaining, ambitious woman that keeps an understanding and open heart and painting those around her into eternity through her perseverance.This was without a doubt one of the finest novels I have ever read. Woolf offers pages after page of incredible poetry, never letting up for an instant. It takes a bit to get your footing, as she drops the reader right into the scene without any exposition, but once you have found your bearings your heart will swell with each flawless word. The middle section of the novel, the brief 20pgs of 'Time Passes', may be one of the most enduring and extraordinary displays of writing I have ever seen. This novel will force the reader to face the bleak truths of change and death along with the characters, yet offer a glimmer of hope through unity and love that is sure to strike a chord in even the coldest of hearts, all the while being a stunning anthem of feminism. This is a novel to read, and read again and again as you witness your own present and future fade into the past.5/5'Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures'This novel came highly recommended to me through two trusted friends, whose reviews I would like to share with youhereandhere.But don't just take our word for it, because this is one that should not be missed!"

So many thoughts flying around and I just didn't see the point in them.I guess I just don't have the mind required to appreciate whatever it is I am supposed to appreciate in this book.If someone would like to tell me what it is I missed that would be helpful, because I am just lost."

        "user_review": "1 to 1.5 starsI had to go look at some other reviews before I wrote this. I can honestly say that I am shocked to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews. That does not mean I think those reviews are incorrect, I am just surprised at how many people connected with this book in a very positive way. I will hang out in the cellar of the 1 and 2 star reviews, because in this case, those are my people!I always want to try new and interesting books from a variety of genres. Sometimes I find some big, positive surprises, other times I find books I struggle to finish. In this case, it was a struggle. I read this book as part of my Completist Book Club as this book is featured on Time's All Time Best 100 Novels list. And, since I am seeing lots of passionate 5-star reviews, many agree with this assessment for To The Lighthouse. And, with that in mind, if you have a passion for the classic must-reads you may enjoy this one. However, I enjoy many, many, classic must-reads so that may not be the best criteria to use.Within minutes of starting this book, I was confused. I reread the beginning a few times and it still was not clicking. Over the course of the book, I reread several sections to try and connect to the writing and pull something from the story. I also read an online summary of every chapter TWICE! Often, after reading a summary section, I would say to myself \"Did I really just read and reread sections of this book!? Nothing in that summary sounded familiar!\" And, when I got to the end of the summary I figured it would clarify for me the whole point, but it really didn't. I know the book is about life, death, and relationships and I get the impression it is somewhat dark. But, after all that, I think I would have taken more away from it all, but I've got nothing.I will say that the one silver lining about it that kept me interested in it is that one of the main characters is named Minta. I have a friend with the same name and always thought it was an unusual name that her parents made up. But, when I asked her, not only did her parents not make up the name, they didn't get it from this book, either! So, just hearing her name frequently as the book went along kept me somewhat engaged.So, yeah . . . this book is a BIG no for me. It is very obviously a masterpiece for some, and maybe it will be for you. But after the effort I put into it and still feeling nothing but nothing, I cannot join the masterpiece crowd.And . . . I guess I'm afraid of Virginia Woolf!"

        "user_review": "When I first read this novel, I was like young James Ramsay, eagerly hoping to get To The Lighthouse.Grown-ups, literary experts that is, had sent just as mixed messages as Mr and Mrs Ramsay to me, and I hoped so much for the adventure of an iconic reading experience that it didn't happen. I could acknowledge all the rational reasons for calling it a masterpiece, but it did not cause me to even raise an eyebrow. I was a modern young woman, what did I have to do with the subtext of a patriarchal family structure? What did I have to do with the self-doubt of a female artist told by an idiot that women can't write, can't paint... Why would such a thing even stick in my head? It didn't. Not back then.And then time passed.Life happened. I learned about families. About attention-seeking egos who dominate an environment so totally that any creative act stops automatically. I learned about the disruption that is a mother's natural state of being. How can anyone paint or write if there are no two consecutive moments without interruption?I learned to long for the lighthouse without knowing it.And then, I had another go at reading it, quite by accident, because I had spare time in a boring place and a copy of the book happened to be on the table.It hit me like the flash of a lightning.This is a novel that you have to grow into, but when you do, it shines brightly in the dark waters and soothes the nerves of a grown-up woman who has unfortunately learned what it means to hear the echo \"can't write, can't paint\", who has learned to feel the presence of patriarchal attention and who has learned to know its effect on the surrounding.It soothes the nerves of a woman who feels the pressure to \"be nice\"...Powerful Lily Briscoe sums it up in the end:\"His immense self-pity, his demand for sympathy poured and spread itself in pools at their feet, and all she did, miserable sinner that she was, was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles, lest she should get wet.\"It's about focusing on moving the tree to the middle of the painting. It's about creating one's own life regardless of whether it ends up not being important to anyone but oneself. It's about daring not to \"be nice\".It's not about reaching the Lighthouse. It's about allowing oneself to see it shine in the distance."

        "user_review": "\"He smiled the most exquisite smile, veiled by memory, tinged by dreams.\"To The Lighthouse ~~ Virginia WoolfTo The Lighthousewas my first exposure toVirginia Woolf. I was working on a production ofEdward Albee'sWhose Afraid Of Virginia Woolf& I thought I should read something by Woolf. For no particular reason I choseTo The Lighthouse. I remember enjoying it, being fascinated by it, but not really understanding what I'd read.How could I have missed the brilliance and artistry ofTo The Lighthouseon my first read? How could I have been so blind? Sadly, I could not see how Woolf shows us that time changes everything ~~ and more importantly ~~ changes nothing. I had read Dickens, Twain, the Brontes, Austen, Porter, Dostoyevsky, & reveled in their insights on the human condition. Why then was I so blind to what Woolf had to offer? As I look back on this first reading, I was probably too young & obviously too stupid to comprehendTo The Lighthouse.Years later I became a huge fan of Woolf. In fact, I've been on Woolf binge the last two years, but never found my way back toTo The Lighthouse.Fast forward to 2019. My friend, Srđan, was readingTo The Lighthouse; his excitement was contagious, so I decided to revisitTo The Lighthouse. I'm so glad I did. Revisiting this book was a revelation.\"She had known happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over at the floor of her mind and she felt, It is enough! It is enough!\"Virginia Woolf, To the LighthouseWhat words would best describeTo The Lighthouse~~ exquisite, impressionistic, simple and most of all luminous. The prose cradles and rocks the reader just like the sea that surrounds the Ramsay family.Woolf sawTo The Lighthouseas a requiem to her parents, and her childhood. The themes here are marriage, childhood, parentage, reminiscence and grief ~~ all themes familiar to Woolf.To The Lighthouseis a portrait of a family's holiday in the years before and after World War I. Mrs. Ramsay is at the center of this world ~~ a wife, mother to eight children, the hostess to the guests who fill the holiday home in the Hebrides ~~ where an expedition to the lighthouse may or may not happen. Mrs. Ramsay's spirit permeates every page ofTo The Lighthouse~~ no easy feat considering the events that take place.Again, Woolf uses her stream of consciousness and multiple perspectives technique. This allows the reader a feeling of living in the pages ofTo The Lighthouse, creating a very intimate experience for the reader.To The Lighthouseis divided into three sections,The Window,Time Passes, andThe Lighthouse. The first section portrays the tensions of her family's holiday ~~ the Ramsays have been joined by a group of friends and colleagues. A planned journey to the fabled lighthouse lies at the center of section one.We also meet painter Lily Briscoe early in the first section. She is attempting to paint a picture of Mrs Ramsay and James, but she is unsure of herself as an artist, her confidence is shaken by Charles Tansley as he declares that women cannot write and cannot paint. Lily ~~ or should we say Virginia ~~ will hear this thought echoing in her mind throughout the rest of her life.The second sectionTo The Lighthouseis brilliant. Time indeed does pass ~~ things have changed. We learn what has happened to the Ramsay family over the past 10 years. The house stands empty, abandoned by the family these past 10 years for reasons you must discover on your own. What fascinates me most aboutTime Passesis how the house becomes a character in its own right ~~ the house is a living thing.In the final section ofTo The Lighthouse, members of the Ramsay family and their guests from ten years earlier return to the house ~~ another trip to the lighthouse is proposed. We see the changes ~~ and more importantly the lack of change ~~ that has taken place in the Ramsay family. It is a fascinating view of both the Ramsay family and Lily Briscoe.I find my review to be wanting. This review ~~ none of our reviews ~~ can sum up what an extraordinary experience readingTo The Lighthouseis.To The Lighthouseis a captivating, fascinating, thought-provoking novel that sparks endless introspection and reflection with its many intriguing themes. Thank you Srđan for helping me to rediscover such a brilliant piece of writing."

        "user_review": "(Book 686 from 1001 books) - To The Lighthouse, Virginia WoolfTo the Lighthouse is a 1927 novel by Virginia Woolf. The novel centres on the Ramsays and their visits to the Isle of Skye in Scotland between 1910 and 1920.Part I: The Window, The novel is set in the Ramsays' summer home in the Hebrides, on the Isle of Skye. The section begins with Mrs Ramsay assuring her son James that they should be able to visit the lighthouse on the next day. This prediction is denied by Mr Ramsay, who voices his certainty that the weather will not be clear, an opinion that forces a certain tension between Mr and Mrs Ramsay, and also between Mr Ramsay and James. This particular incident is referred to on various occasions throughout the section, especially in the context of Mr and Mrs Ramsay's relationship. ...Part II: Time Passes, The second section \"Time passes\" gives a sense of time passing, absence, and death. Ten years pass, during which the First World War begins and ends. Mrs Ramsay dies, as do two of her children – Prue dies from complications of childbirth, and Andrew is killed in the war. Mr Ramsay is left adrift without his wife to praise and comfort him during his bouts of fear and anguish regarding the longevity of his philosophical work. This section is told from an omniscient point of view and occasionally from Mrs. McNab's point of view. Mrs. McNab worked in the Ramsay's house since the beginning, and thus provides a clear view of how things have changed in the time the summer house has been unoccupied.Part III: The Lighthous, In the final section, \"The Lighthouse\", some of the remaining Ramsays and other guests return to their summer home ten years after the events of Part I. Mr Ramsay finally plans on taking the long-delayed trip to the lighthouse with daughter Cam(illa) and son James (the remaining Ramsay children are virtually unmentioned in the final section). The trip almost does not happen, as the children are not ready, but they eventually set off. As they travel, the children are silent in protest at their father for forcing them to come along. However, James keeps the sailing boat steady and rather than receiving the harsh words he has come to expect from his father, he hears praise, providing a rare moment of empathy between father and son; Cam's attitude towards her father changes also, from resentment to eventual admiration. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه مارس سال 2004میلادیعنوان: به سوی فانوس دریایی؛ نویسنده: ویرجینیا وولف؛ مترجم: صالح حسینی؛ تهران، نیلوفر، 1370؛ در 237ص؛ شابک 9644481992؛ چاپ دوم 1382؛ چاپ سوم 1383؛ چاپ چهارم 1385؛ چاپ پنجم 1387؛ چاپ ششم 1392؛ چاپ هفتم 1395؛ شابک 9789644481994؛در 240ص؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20معنوان: به سوی فانوس دریایی؛ نویسنده: ویرجینیا وولف؛ مترجم: سیلویا بجانیان؛ تهران، به نگار، 1370؛ در 358 ص؛عنوان: به سوی فانوس دریایی؛ نویسنده: ویرجینیا وولف؛ مترجم: خجسته کیهان؛ تهران، نگاه، 1387؛ در 261��؛ شابک 9789643514648؛ چاپ سوم 1392؛به‌ سوی فانوس دریایی رمانی است از «ویرجینیا وولف»، که داستان خانواده ی «رمزی»، و دیدار آن‌ها از جزیره «اسکای (آسمان)» در «اسکاتلند»، بین سال‌های 1910میلادی، تا 1920میلادی را، حکایت می‌کند؛ این اثر یکی از موفق‌ترین تجربه‌ های ایشان، در سبک جریان سیال ذهن است؛ داستان از سه بخش تشکیل شده است؛بخش نخست که بیشترین حجم کتاب را هم در بر می‌گیرد، «پنجره» نام دارد؛ پنجره معانی گوناگونی می‌تواند داشته باشد؛ شاید پنجره‌ ای برای ما برای شناخت قهرمانان داستان، یا شاید هم پنجره‌ ای برای قهرمانان داستان، تا از آن به فانوس دریایی برسند، و شاید خود داستان، که با راوی‌های گوناگونی، و به عبارتی دیگر از پنجره‌ های گوناگون روایت می‌شود، در این بخش، نویسنده ی داستان، یک روز از زندگی خانواده «رمزی» را، همراه با مهمانان آنان، از زبان خودشان روایت می‌کند؛ این روایت راویانی دارد، و همین یکی از برجسته‌ ترین نکات رمان است، که از زبان راوی‌های گوناگون روایت می‌شود؛ زندگی یکایک شخصیت‌های داستان، با تفصیلی باور نکردنی، از زبان خودشان بیان می‌شود؛ زندگی، و بیان همه ی آن‌ها، در خانم «رمزی» به اشتراک می‌رسند؛ که حلقه ی پیوند همه ی قهرمانان داستان است؛بخش دوم کتاب: «زمان می‌گذرد» نام دارد، روایتی تند، از سرنوشت قهرمانان داستان، طی ده سال آینده است، و اینکه خانم «رمزی» می‌میرد، خانواده ی «رمزی» از هم می‌پاشد، و دیگر رخدادهای کوچک و بزرگی که رخ می‌دهند؛بخش سوم و پایانی داستان، با عنوان «فانوس دریایی»، برمیگردد به اینکه، در غیاب خانم «رمزی»، قهرمانان داستان، دوباره به خانه ی قدیمی برمیگردند، آقای «رمزی» و پسرهایش به فانوس دریایی می‌روند، «لی لی بریسکو»، نقاشی‌ اش را در حالتی که به شهود رسیده است، کامل می‌کند، و «کارمایکل» به شهرت در شاعری دست می‌یابد؛ همه ی آن‌ها راه خویش را پیدا می‌کنند، و به شناخت می‌رسند؛ در واقع خانم «رمزی» که واسطه ی شناخت آن‌ها، از زندگی بود نیز، به آرز��ی خویش می‌رسدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 27/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 21/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

Mrs. Ramsay and her family's story is wonderfully depicted through the beauty of surrealism and the depth of philosophy. Only a writer on the top of their craft can create something so magnificent from the simple things in life like a family holiday. The character building, precise perspective-shifting are all done brilliantly. Ms. Woolf's views on men, women, friendship, love, marriage, children, motherhood, and the poetry of life will all make you think deeply about the hidden complexities of this world. Her use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device is impeccable.This book can be incontrovertibly called a true masterpiece.\"She felt... how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up with it and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach.\"—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube First Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Second Channel - Dasfill - Malayalam|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1"

        "user_review": "How many prejudices we carry through life, even when we think ourselves to be incapable of bias.I avoided reading Virginia Woolf for a very long time, suspecting her and her privileged Bloomsbury friends of intellectual elitism and of believing themselves to somehow enshrine the essence of civilisation (E M Forsterescaped this embargo fortunately).When I came across Charles Tansley, the visiting working-class academic who can't seem to fit in to the Ramseys' elegantly shabby lifestyle in the early pages ofTo the Lighthouse, I immediately aligned myself with him. I'll be on your side, Charles, I thought, I wouldn't fit in with the Ramseys either.But soon, like Tansley, I fell under the spell of the beautiful Mrs Ramsey, and under the spell of Woolf's writing which is so unique and inventive that I am thrilled to have finally discovered it.I picked this book up because I came across a claim that Woolf, having finished readingUlysses, felt that she could do better in a quarter the amount of pages. Since I'd recently finished Ulysses myself, I was curious about Woolf's foolhardy challenge. I expected to find myself reading her characters' fragmentary thoughts, realistically ordinary or eruditely obscure depending on the mood, just as in Ulysses. But no, Woolf avoids such bold naturalism by paraphrasing her characters' thoughts into beautifully crafted, ultra refined sentences. This valuing of beauty over truth, form over content certainly makes the reader's task a lot easier than in Ulysses, if less challenging, and allows the wonderful structure of this novel to stand out more clearly.There are two distinct sections, both focussed on a trip to the lighthouse and they are separated and connected by a shorter section, a sort of corridor of years, which shows us the disintegration that nature and time work on everything and everyone. I found this symmetrical structure really satisfying, as the two longer sections mirror each other in so many ways and yet are inevitably very different, being separated by time itself.As regards resemblances to Ulysses, Woolf begins with the word 'yes' and ends with 'yes' repeated in the last sentences but unlike Joyce, Woolf doesn't take on a full day, only the final quarter of a day; she addresses the first quarter of a different day in the last section.While Woolf avoids the challenge of 'stream of consciousness' writing in favour of reporting her character's thoughts, she knits those thoughts into the action with great skill; the reader quickly adjusts to the style as well as to the frequent time shifts and to the occasional shifts in point of view. And while I value the stark realism which is found at times in Ulysses, there is also a lot of truth knitted into the beautiful shape of Woolf's novel: there are valuable reflections on the challenges of relationships, particularly those of husbands and wives and parents and children; there are interesting musings on art and literature, poetry and philosophy; and there are very, very beautiful thoughts on death and dying.This book will stay with me for a long time to come.Review: August 2012.Edit: May 2015: extracts I've just come across inA Writer's Diarydescribing Woolf's thoughts about the writing of 'To The Lighthouse': 1926:This is going to be fairly short; to have father's character done complete in it; and mother's; and St Ives; and childhood; and all the usual things I try to put in--life, death, etc. But the centre is father's character, sitting in a boat, reciting 'We perished, each alone', while he crushes a dying mackerel....The sea is to be heard all through it...But this theme may be sentimental; father and mother and child in the garden; the death; the sail to the Lighthouse. I think though that when I begin it I will enrich it in all sorts of ways; thicken it; give it branches--roots which I do not perceive now. It might contain all characters boiled down; and childhood; and then this impersonal thing, which I'm dared to do by my friends, the flight of time and the consequent break of unity in my design. That passage (I conceive the book in three parts. 1. at the drawing-room window; 2. seven years passed; 3. the voyage) interests me very much....I am now writing as fast and as freely as I have written my whole life..;I think this is the proof that I was on the right path; and that what fruit hangs in my soul is to be reached there....Yesterday I finished the first part and today begin the second. I cannot make it out--here is the most difficult abstract piece of writing--I have to give an empty house, no people's characters, the passage of time, all eyeless and featureless with nothing to cling to; will I rush at it, and at once scatter out two pages...The problem is how to bring Lily and Mr R together and make a combination of interest at the end. I am feathering about with various ideas. The last chapter which I begin tomorrow is in the Boat; I had meant to end with R climbing on to the rock. If so, what becomes of Lily and her picture? Should there be a final page about her and Carmichael looking at the picture and summing up R's character? In this case I lose the intensity of the moment. If this intervenes between R and the lighthouse, there's too much chop and change, I think. Could I do it in a parenthesis? So that on the sense of reading the two things at the same time?...The lyric portions of To the Lighthouse are collected in the 10-year lapse and don't interfere with the text so much as usual; I feel as if it fetched its circle pretty completely this time....And the last lap, in the boat, is hard, because the material is not so rich as it was with Lily on the lawn. I am forced to be more and more intense. I am making more use of symbolism, I observe, and I go in dread of 'sentimentality'. Is the whole theme open to the charge?"

        "user_review": "Virginia Woolf'sTo The Lighthouseis an innovative piece of writing that left me feeling empty, neither happy nor sad, just blank and detached from the book itself.Let me explain: for me the writing just didn't covey anything of much importance. Sure, you could talk about Woolf's innovative style and how important this book is in the formation of English literature as we know it today; it clearly has impacted the novel as an art form. And it adheres to Woolf's arguments in her essay titled Modern Fiction. It's about realism; it's about capturing a multitude of perspectives and voices regarding the complexities of perception and human experiences. It acts to show how different people think in very different ways. And that's it.The plot is unimportant here so I'm not going to talk about that or criticise it. Woolf was purposely trying to break narrative conventions. She didn't want a plot. She didn't need one. Though I'm left with a feeling of emptiness after reading it. What do I take away from the book? What's the overall point of it? Surely there's more to it than showing that different people think, feel and express themselves in a way specifically personal to them? I'm just left with a puzzling feeling that makes me form a question that lingers over my mind whenever I think about this book: was thatreallyit Woolf, don't you have a little more to say?The success of the writing resides with its subtlety. Woolf says so much without saying anything at all. Her characters are revealed through small gestures that reveal their internal world. Simple things like an agreement about the weather bespeaks the love between two characters. Her narration is minimalistic or, I should say, the narrator describes without comment and the rest is up to the reader. And, as ever, she is fantastic at portraying images and moments in time. The scenes she creates are some of the most real and true I've ever read.There are thoughts flying around everywhere. Woolf shifts beautifully from character to character, from voice to voice, as the writing forms a symphony on the mundanity of life. Some of the characters are also quite psychologically complex (Mr Ramsey) and there's many layers within the story telling that bring the narrative together.But, again, I'm not entirely sure what to take away from it all. I shall leave things here. I enjoyed it, but I could never love it."

        "user_review": "Virginia Woolf here gives us possibly the best ever description of her own writing method, especially fitting for this novel and The Waves – \"Beautiful and bright it should be on the surface, feathery and evanescent, one colour melting into another like the colours on a butterfly's wing; but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with bolts of iron. It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses.\"Perhaps the first thing to say about To the Lighthouse is what an utterly brilliant depiction it is of a seaside holiday home, especially as experienced through the eyes of a child. It brought vividly to life so many of my own memories of sleeping in a room where the sound of the waves came in through the window at night and sand crunches underfoot everywhere. Every moment in To the Lighthouse is a defining moment, a moment in which identity is forged, memory is made, knowledge is gathered; every moment creates a ghost of itself which will survive the ravages of time. The seaside holiday home is among the most treasured historical sites for the archaeologist in us all, our Mycenae, our Troy, a place from which we can trace the rudiments of identity.On the surface To the Lighthouse is about two trips to a lighthouse, one aborted, the other realised. In between the first world war happens and we pass from the Victorian age to the Edwardian. Lily Briscoe, a painter, is the novel's principle touchstone. It's she who the novel will liberate. Just as The Waves is a wholly original restructuring of the form of biography, To the Lighthouse is a wholly original restructuring of the form of autobiography. Though Virginia is absent in any literal sense from To the Lighthouse she pervades it. Mr and Mrs Ramsey are clearly portraits of her parents – and what fantastic living portraits they are. Lily Briscoe isn't their daughter in the novel but essentially, through Lily, what we're reading about is Virginia Woolf's journey from stifled Victorian young girl to creative Edwardian woman. It's probably the best book ever about women's liberation.A lot has been written about the significance of the Lighthouse. Basically, its light, seen from afar at night, is a magical presence; seen close up in the light of day it is a prosaic thing without wonder. In that sense it's like Gatsby's green light. But whereas Fitzgerald chose to depict this light as essentially illusory, albeit with a high inspirational charge, Woolf perhaps sees that light as a representation of those heightened moments of sensibility, or \"moments of being\" as she called them, when, for a fleeting moment, we carry a candle into the dark and catch sight of a vision informed by understanding, wholeness, an enduring significance.As a footnote I have to comment on how comically inept the synopsis of this novel is. Lily spends the entire novel trying to work out the truth of who Mr and Mrs Ramsey are. The author of the synopsis has no such difficulty – they're both nailed down with a two worded epithet - \"tragic yet absurd\" and \"serene and maternal\". We're then told \"As time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and simultaneously, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumph--the human capacity for change.\" Mrs Ramsey though is only alive for one day in this novel so I'm not sure how she faces any challenge of change and Mr Ramsey barely changes at all. Lily, the novel's most important character, doesn't even get a mention."

        "user_review": "3.5 stars\"She could see it all so clearly, so commandingly, when she looked: it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed. It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child.\"The quote above is in reference to Lily Briscoe, one of several guests of the Ramsays during their summer holidays to the Isle of Skye. She has a vision of this place and of the Ramsay family, which she desires to capture on canvas. The painting is left unfinished in the first section of the book, only to be completed on the very last page after the passage of ten years time. I admit it also sums up quite perfectly the feeling I have when reading and reviewing a Woolf piece. I have a complicated relationship with Woolf thus far. I see her vision as if through a fog. I gather up pieces of it in moments of clarity, until all fade once again. Like the Lighthouse that blinks, alternately illuminating and darkening, Woolf's message comes to me in fragments. Once I have finished one of her novels, the whole is finally made clear, just as Lily's composition is made complete with that final brushstroke.\"When darkness fell, the stroke of the Lighthouse, which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the darkness, tracing its pattern, came now in the softer light of spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingered stealthily and looked and came lovingly again.\"The structure of this book is nothing short of brilliant. That much I can concede. That doesn't make it an easy read by any means. It requires fierce concentration and a keen awareness as the perspective jumps from one character's inner life to the next. The first part of the novel is marked by a planned trip to visit the Lighthouse, and whether this adventure will come to pass or not. This is the whole of any sort of plot that exists. The depth of the novel comes from the private thoughts of both the main and secondary characters. How can anyone really grasp what another person feels and thinks? There are misunderstandings and illusions on the surface. We are able to see these things, even if briefly, through Woolf's lens. Mrs. Ramsay stands at the core of this section. Not only are her introspections revealed to us, we are further offered glimpses of her as seen by the others. We see how the guests view one another, how parents view children and vice versa, and what spouses reveal about their relationships.\"It could not last, she knew, but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people, and their thoughts and their feelings, without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves, and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging, trembling.\"The middle section of the book highlights the unrelenting passing of time. Despite the impact these characters have made on us as readers, time will do its dirty business of changing all that we have known. War intrudes, life's challenges interfere. What remains is a house, the land. Human lives are transitory.\"Nothing, it seemed, could survive the flood, the profusion of darkness which, creeping in at keyholes and crevices, stole round window blinds, came into bedrooms, swallowed up here a jug and basin, there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers… there was scarcely anything left of body or mind by which one could say, 'This is he' or 'This is she.'\"The last section of the novel sees some characters returning to the house after the war, after ten years have passed. Some have come and gone from this world. Those that remain intend to realize a journey to the Lighthouse that had been previously thwarted. The metaphor of the lighthouse is clearly one that can be mulled over and discussed endlessly it seems. I'm not confident in my ability to convey what the expedition as well as its outcome truly means. Likely, I could give you different answers depending on which character we consider. Is the Lighthouse perhaps a symbol of hope, one that can alternately brighten and then dim without reason? Is the idea of getting there, the actual journey, more important than the end result? Are the moments of illumination the ones we should grasp and hold onto, despite the moments of darkness?Woolf is indeed challenging for me as a reader. I appreciate the genius and the beauty of her writing, but it's difficult for me to truly enjoy the experience while I am actually in the moment. It's the reflection afterwards when the canvas is more fully revealed that I can applaud its significance and value.\"What is the meaning of life? That was all – a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.\""

But with 15 at the dinner table , ( not counting the servants) that will be a goal unattainable. Mrs.Ramsay is a beauty, she pretends to ignore that fact still her aging, brilliant, distant philosopher husband does not, is proud... a book writer in metaphysics, (what is reality, unpopular today) constantly wondering if he'll be remembered in the future, the new generation ignores his writings. A mild tyrant at home, his children are afraid of but he is too involved in his work, and mostly neglects them. Mrs. Ramsay is loved by James, Andrew, Jasper, Roger, and Prue, Rose, Nancy, Cam, her sons and daughters. Six -year- old James is very close to his mother, the shy boy hates his father who intimidates him, like his siblings are too, all the boy wants is to go and visit the nearby alluring lighthouse, on a tiny island. The father insists frequently, to the child's great annoyance that bad weather tomorrow for their planned trip, will prevent this. Mrs. Ramsay to soothe the anxious James, unwisely tell him that all will be fine in the morning, naturally a storm arrives and the child is disappointed, his detestation increases against the father...Lily Briscoe, a friend of Mrs.Ramsay's, is painting on a white canvas, a beautiful picture of the island and sea, outside the shabby house of her friends, ( they are not wealthy) maybe even the lighthouse, the trouble is, she can not finish it. Something always stops the woman, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay, the children, birds making noises, little critters scurrying around, the strong winds, friends talking, Mr.Tansley saying women can't paint or write any excuse she needs. The old maid enjoys the company of Mr.William Banks, an older widower, Mrs. Ramsay a romantic at heart, and a busy matchmaker is trying to get the two married. Plain Lily is not very enthusiastic, she likes her freedom, a lonely life for her she wants.... Years pass people die, the war begins and finally ends, nothing lasts forever the ghosts of the past will not stay dead, memories linger on the survivors continue, they can't forget. James at long last takes the boat with his detested father, yet looking for his approval he needs, brothers and sisters on board, to the fabled black and white lighthouse, above the horizon the smooth sea cooperates, a steady wind blows the sails full, the bright blue sky and equally blue ocean makes this the perfect day for their voyage. Miss Lily Briscoe, at this melancholic time completes her task, only ten years late she will put this masterpiece in the attic..."

        "user_review": "\"Al faro\" es un cuadro, el intento de aprehender un instante.\"Al faro\" es un cuadro que la autora va levantando ante nosotros pincelada a pincelada. Es un momento fijado para siempre en el que los colores aparecen mezclados, donde nada es del todo preciso, donde hasta los objetos y los paisajes son mostrados desde la sensibilidad de cada uno de los personajes, a través de sus sentimientos, de sus emociones, de sus ideas, de sus recuerdos, de sus evocaciones. Nada ocurre fuera de la mente de estos seres, no hay acontecimientos, no hay consumación ni superación de deseos, anhelos, esperanzas, miedos, todo queda reflejado y fijado en el cuadro en una escena total no más importante que cada una de sus partes.\"Al faro\" es un cuadro que cuestiona eso que llamamos realidad, su comprensión, su representación, la posibilidad de expresarla.\"Veía ella todo con tanta claridad, con tanta seguridad, cuando dirigía la mirada a la escena; pero todo cambiaba cuando cogía el pincel. Era en ese momento fugaz que se interponía entre la visión y el lienzo cuando la asaltaban los demonios, que, a menudo, la dejaban a punto de echarse a llorar, y convertían ese trayecto entre concepción y trabajo en algo tan horrible como un pasillo oscuro para un niño. Le sucedía con frecuencia: luchaba en inferioridad de condiciones para mantener el valor; tenía que decirse: «Lo veo así, lo veo así», para atesorar algún resto de la visión en el corazón, una visión que un millar de fuerzas se esforzaba en arrancarle.\"\"Al faro\" es un cuadro catártico para la autora, como seguramente lo fueron todas sus novelas, un intento de reconciliarse con sus padres, encarnados aquí por el Sr. y la Sra. Ramsay. Esa implicación personal en su obra, más allá de la búsqueda del valor literario, como para Lily Briscoe, el tercer personaje principal de la obra, significaba la pintura, seguramente contribuye a esa fuerza especial que caracteriza su prosa.\"Acabarían colgándolo en la buhardilla o deshaciéndose de él, pensó. Pero ¿qué más daba?, se preguntó volviendo a coger el pincel.\"Pero, sobre todo, \"Al faro\" es un bello cuadro, casi tan magnífico como \"La señora Dalloway\" con la que comparte algunos temas y, sobre todo, una lírica y un estilo. Por encima de cualquier otra consideración, es la forma impresionista, a medio camino entre la narrativa y la poesía, lo más sobresaliente del relato como lo fue en aquella. Nuevamente se repite aquí la combinación de la primera y tercera persona con la que la autora concatena los distintos diálogos interiores y los consiguientes puntos de vista que conforman la narración; se conserva también el gusto por el detalle cotidiano, así como el poder evocador de la recreación de ambientes y la descripción sentimental de escenarios y objetos.Algunos de los fantasmas que Woolf pretendía exorcizar con su señora Dalloway permanecen aquí: el paso del tiempo, la frustración, la incomunicación, el papel de la mujer en la familia y en la sociedad, la homosexualidad, la duda existencial, la soledad, \"aquella soledad que constituía (…) la auténtica esencia de las cosas\".A estos hay que añadir ahora el afán de inmortalidad, de permanencia en la de memoria de los otros que se observa en dos de los personajes principales: el Sr. Ramsey a través de sus libros y la Sra. Ramsey por su necesidad de influencia en el transcurso de otras vidas. Y, por supuesto, las relaciones paternofiliales.Aunque ello no ha sido impedimento para disfrutarla de principio a fin, he de reconocer que la obra está algo descompensada. Con una parte inicial soberbia y un interludio sorprendente, la parte final, quizás solo por comparación, me ha parecido floja. En cualquier caso, sigo manteniendo que Virginia Woolf es un portento y que posee la magia que caracteriza a los grandes."

        "user_review": "Bewildered yet transfixed, I painstakingly studied each beautifully crafted sentence with patience; like an obsessed detective looking for hidden clues as to just what Virginia Woolf had put in front of me: for the most part, I hadn't the foggiest. It took awhile, but eventually I slowly started to part the fog to see a quite beautiful novel in front of me. This book requires complete and utter attention, that's one thing I easily recognized early on. The language Woolf speaks is rich and imposing, casting an hypnotic spell over me, even thought to begin I was awash with confusion, reading Woolf for the first time has truly opened my eyes to why she is regarded so highly: the writing; I haven't come across anything quite like this before. It's not the greatest novel I have, or will ever read, but the writing is quite astonishing.But why? I asked myself; why go to the lighthouse at all? Why the big fuss about going or not going, what was it about? The Mrs Ramsey that had me enraptured? She who went about in her garden in silly old hats; she who pampered Mr Ramsey with spoonfuls of tactful acquiescence. A man who appeared unworthy. Then there's Lily Briscoe, who wanted to be an artist; full of desire, but pretty hopeless at painting. And what about the children? Who tither here and there, almost in a haze. It's safe to say the characters of Woolf are much elusive and the story is inconclusive, as on the outside everything seems unfathomable. So just what the hell was it that had me adoring it so much?Simply put Woolf evoked a feeling deep within of family, both living and deceased, and is there anything more important than that? It had me thinking of my own childhood; holidays; fragmented memories, from a seemingly distant life. Woolf clearly opened up her heart, so I opened mine right back.I barley finished reading but looking back now it feels like a dream. Something I read in the land of the subconscious. A warm glowing extraordinary emotional pitch still burns inside. All starting with the first paragraphs describing the heavenly bliss of a six-year-old boy cutting pictures of kitchen appliances out of a magazine, and ending with the Lighthouse in sight. Even the parentheses in the novel's stylised middle section was deeply strange, and all along I seemed to forget this was written some 90 years ago. The writing of people and their feelings was unequivocally overwhelming, her prose so highly wrought. It took time for me to register that its setting was actually centred on summer holidays spent around Isle of Skye, Scotland. I would also learn the novel does have personal ties with Woolf: her parents; the gaping hole that opened when her mother passed away; and the way her father imposed himself and his grief upon his daughters. Mrs Ramsay is at the centre of Woolf's thinking, then she is no more; the survivors must bear her absence.To the Lighthousewas the literary equivalent to perching in the back of someone else's mind; going through their own pains and joys through the thought process. There was nothing extraordinary about her characters, they were rather conventional, nothing new, but her prose is proof of the skill in which they are written, and they could quite easily be anyone else's neighbours or friends. She captured exactly the essence of certain people, and their traits and mannerisms. It took time to adjust myself to Woolf's writing, and had me thinking it's the sort of book only those with an English Literature degree will find easy to penetrate; whereas for me, I started out from a distance, far, but finally ended up on a pebbly beach, close, where the clouds parted, revealing clearer skies.I could have abandoned this early on, but just so glad I didn't. Can I conclude it is a masterpiece then? For the writing alone it's worthy of top marks, but I think it definitely requires a second reading, which, most likely, would be better than the first."

        "user_review": "A Virginia Woolf hay que leerla de seguido. Sus novelas requieren que te introduzcas tanto en sus historias como en sus propios pensamientos, y cuanto más la lees más la aprecias.'Al faro' no me ha fascinado como 'La señora Dalloway' (Porque eso es IMPOSIBLE), pero me ha gustado muchísimo.La narración y los temas son similares, e incluso tiene una figura femenina central similar a aquella. En este caso podríamos decir que la protagonista es Mrs. Ramsay, una mujer de mediana edad, madre de 8 hijos y esposa de un egocéntrico filósofo. La historia arranca con una anécdota, la intención de la familia entera de ir a visitar el faro, durante su estancia en la isla de Skye en Escocia en 1910.Veremos a través de sus páginas lo que supone la pérdida, el efecto de la guerra, la soledad, el papel de la mujer y las difíciles relaciones familiares y sentimentales.Una vez más los libros de esta autora suponen un esfuerzo de EMPATÍA por parte del lector, aunque en mi caso tengo una extraña conexión con Woolf y sus personajes lo que me hace disfrutar de sus historias desde la primera página hasta la última.En este caso el personaje con el que he conectado más profundamente ha sido Lily Briscoe, una joven pintora que se aloja junto a otros amigos en la casa de los Ramsay, pero todos los personajes me han resultado tan interesantes como creíbles.Me ha gustado muchísimo la estructura del libro, dividida en tres partes en las que la segunda es una especie de puente entre la primera y tercera, separadas por un espacio de tiempo de 10 años. Amé mucho la segunda parte, pero mucho.Terminé el libro con ganas de volver a empezarlo otra vez, y eso me pasa tan pocas veces... ♡"

        "user_review": "Oh Virginia! How is it that you make your words spring to life from the barren pages and hit my senses with the force of a gale every time? How is it that you peel off the layers of the banal and reveal the terrible beauty of the core? How is it that you steer my consciousness so deep into the murky waters of uncharted territory that resurfacing takes a toll on my strength?I wonder what spirit possessed you every time you picked up your pen, brimming over with confidence or maybe unsure of your own craft, to pour every ounce of what weighed on your mind fluidly into the empty pages waiting in anticipation. I wonder if you heard the voices of decades lost in the spiral of time whispering into your ears the truest wisdom of all, as you sat at a desk in a room of your own, pursuing the tail end of some stray thought. I wonder if you ever realized the worth of what you wrote or the gift you have left for generations to cherish after your bones and flesh have been turned to dust and returned to where they rose from.I wonder if I have ever known a woman like Mrs Ramsay in person - been enamored of her ethereal beauty and grudgingly admired her command over the hearts of those who lived in her shadow and the way she let go of that same command as and when her whimsies deemed fit. I wonder if nearly every marital bond ever forged between two individuals has been or is a replication of the interplay of words and emotions, spoken and unspoken, between the Ramsays. I wonder if Lily Briscoe is truly a personification of the unified spirit of the man and the woman, their dichotomies conjoining imperfectly in the splotches of color she dabs on to her empty canvasses.I strive to make sense of the lighthouse and what it illuminates in a rare moment facilitating cognition, when my eyes have become well-adjusted to the darkness. I don't get the purpose of its existence but I do. I see the lighthouse, hazy and sprayed white by the sea imprisoning it on all sides, standing tall in all its majestic grandeur merging with the horizon, out of my reach and I wonder how it looms so large yet recedes into the distance as a mute, inanimate witness to the play acts of life. I see it as I turn the pages, sometimes not understanding what it is that Virginia wants me to grasp and sometimes struck speechless by the impact of a realization in an instant of profound lucidity.No other book has rendered me so completely helpless in my measly efforts to encapsulate its essence. No other book has required of me such prolonged contemplation.Think of the usual quota of trite responses to a question like\"How're you?\". Think of the quick\"I'm fine\"or\"I'm well, how are you?\"that comes without a moment's delay and how untrue and inadequate either response is each time. If somebody asks me to pronounce judgement on TTL, I'd perhaps respond with an equally predictable'It is the best book I have read yet'and realize instantly how vapid and insincere this answer is, how silly it is to call this Woolf creation merely a \"best book\".Currents of erratic thoughts, many of them contradictory in nature, are zipping past each other inside my head this moment and I am unable to articulate into words the fact of their individual existence as I open my mouth or let my fingers move over this keyboard. That is what attempting to dissectTo the Lighthousefeels like. Irrespective of what I write or attempt to write, it is sure to be of little significance and ineffective in giving anyone even a teeny glimpse of what Virginia succeeds in capturing so flawlessly.Sights and sounds and smells and emotions - strong, subtle, indescribable. The ephemeral quality of an instant when a man and a woman watch their little girl play with a ball, a rare moment in time when each of their individual actions and thoughts are somehow in perfect harmony. The resolute constancy of life and it's cautious but sure-footed tread on the newer ground of change and our bittersweet relationship with this change. A melding together of past, present and future in a blur of color and meaning. Every human emotion ever known and felt. All of this and much more. A pure cerebral extravaganza, a celebration of the collective spirit of our existence on this ugly and beautiful world of ours, an acknowledgement of both pain and joy. That is what I think it is.I dream of going to the lighthouse one day like James, I dream of letting it guide my progress in the lightless, labyrinthine pathways into the heart and soul of this narrative once again. I dream of not allowing any sentence, any word to whiz past me uncomprehended when I read this again some day.Till then I only delight in swaying to the rhythm of her words, in her immortal lyrics in the song of life."

        "user_review": "To the Lighthousewas my first exposure to Virginia Woolf. Unfortunately, after reading about forty pages, I gave up. I wasn't comfortable with her stream of consciousness and kept her out of my reading list. Since that time, however, I have read a few of her major works and have come to adore her. I've grown comfortable with her writing now.To the Lighthouseis Virginia's most autobiographical work. The main characters - Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay were modeled on her real-life parents. The character of Lily Briscoe and her thoughts on the creative process of painting represent her thoughts on writing. Some of the events of the book too are taken from real life. This autobiographic element gives this work a truthfulness and an earnestness that goes right through to the reader's heart.To the Lighthousetouches on many themes. Outwardly, one can identify marriage as one focal theme. Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey's marriage is one balanced between intellect and emotion, Mr. Ramsay bringing the intellect and Mrs. Ramsay the emotions. The combined harmony of these two aspects keeps them together irrespective of their so different temperaments. The parent and child relationship is another theme. The paternal authority of Mr. Ramsay and its ineffective smoothing by his wife leave the younger Ramsay children considering their father a tyrant, a despot. Their resentment for him and his authority is too great to be smoothed by the mother's love. But what their mother couldn't do, time does. Ten-year span sees a reconciliation through mature understanding and respect. All these stemmed from Virginia's personal experiences and her need to express them and to share them in the guise of a story, for it is said that writing this novel was Virginia's attempt at understanding her parents and their relationship and hers with them.But the most important is the inward focus on the meaning of life. There is an in-depth discussion of change, impermanence, and death. Virginia captures the ephemeral nature of life and the human's eternal struggle in finding the meaning of life within it. The Ramsays and their friends too go through this familiar struggle. In this ever-changing life, with its impermanence, they try desperately to hold on to something for permanence and stability. This may be an object or a feeling or even a fleeting moment. Mrs. Ramsay's and James's focus is on the lighthouse. It is both a symbol of permanence and illumination but is inaccessible. Mrs. Ramsey dies not visiting it and when James Ramsay visits the lighthouse at last it is only to realize that it is not as he imagined. Lily Briscoe's painting is her object of permanence. But she never finishes it. And Mr. Ramsay's ground for permanence is his work. Yet, he is constantly anxious and fearful lest he and his work will be soon forgotten. He seeks permanence and immortality which cannot be attained. This philosophical and psychological discussion was so fascinating and it is what I enjoyed the most.Above all, however, what most draws me to Virginia is her writing. It is her strength. It is the weapon with which she captures readers' hearts. There is such lyrical beauty in her writing notwithstanding her stream of consciousness. Her writing is poetry in the prosaic guise. I was very much absorbed from page one to the end. It was such a beautiful work of literature that reading it was such a pleasure.Many critics believe thatWavesis Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. And while I agree with them I must admit thatTo the Lighthousefollows closely behind given the intensity of thoughts and emotions she has poured into it. And Virginia Woolf herself had admitted that it was \"easily the best of (her) books\"."

It is described as the novel that established Virginia Woolf as a leading writer of the 20th century.So I started, and on page 6, I came to this sentence …She was now formidable to behold, and it was only in silence, looking up from their plates, after she had spoken so severely about Charles Tansley, that her daughters, Prue, Nancy, Rose - could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers; in Paris, perhaps; a wilder life; not always taking care of some man or other; for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry, of the Bank of England and the Indian Empire, of ringed fingers and lace, though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty, which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts, and made them, as they sat at the table beneath their mother's eyes, honour her strange severity, her extreme courtesy, like a Queen's raising from the mud to wash a beggar's dirty foot, when she thus admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them - or, speaking accurately, been invited to stay with them - in the Isles of Skye.I stopped reading.I see many 5***** ratings. If anyone who loved it wants to offer a reason why I should continue reading, I am open to hear it."

        "user_review": "That's another magnificent text, which has the disadvantage of burying all the others. After Virginia, they seem to be the work of sluggish jobbers. But, finally, I will get over it.To talk about it is to diminish it. To seek its meaning and symbolism is to reduce it. Like Rimbaud's Illuminations, you have to read it and let a thousand images, feelings, and gigantic or tiny sensations that are described flourish in you. Everything mingles and intertwines around a thin thread, a couple, a holiday home, an island of Scotland, the sea, a lighthouse, a garden, a window, people, children, words spoken or not, and secret thoughts.One can still say: that a woman, Mrs. Ramsay, is, feels, is perhaps, the center of gravity of a family of eight children, a husband, and friends on vacation. The youngest, James, wants to go to the lighthouse by boat. His mother tells him they will go the next day, but his father declares it will be wrong; the wind blows from the west. So the day goes by, and, as in Mrs. Dalloway, she condenses the central part of the characters. The fluid mind narrator moves from one psyche to another, and the characters, like the tide's ebb and flow, let themselves permeate with all their movements. Mrs. Ramsay and her husband, who devours her excellent, fascinating painter, Lily Briscoe, try to paint her from the garden. Behind her window, mother to the child with his son James, the young Charles Tansey, looking for his place, disagreeable, fascinated too. William Bankes, Ramsay's friend, resists the charm of Mrs. Ramsay, Paul, and Minta, whom she wants to marry, and the children who venerate: dinner, beef stew, bedtime, end of the day, storm. Unlike Mrs Dalloway, however, the story starts again, \"Time passes\" and \"The Lighthouse\" constitute an unfortunate and melancholy sequel to the glorious summer day of the first part.There, I've said too much. There is much more to it. It is enlightenment."

Μια πρόβλεψη, που ουσιαστικά μέσα απ�� τη χρονική πορεία των γεγονότων, προκαλείται η πραγμάτωση της με διφορούμενη σημασία.Αν επιδράσουν θετικά η πεποίθηση και η συμπεριφορά τότε πραγματοποιείται με επιτυχία η επίτευξη του στόχου ακόμη κι αν πρόκειται για μια χίμαιρα. Η σαγηνευτική λάμψη του φάρου των επιθυμιών σου ( κρυφών ή απαγορευμένων) σε προσκαλεί να την πλησιάσεις «τώρα»-προσδιορισμός χρόνου- άμεσα, έγκαιρα, θαραλλέα.Αν το αναβάλλεις χρονικά ελπίζοντας σε καλύτερες συνθήκες ή διαιωνίζοντας την κυριαρχία των προσωπικών σου φόβων, η λανθασμένη ένωση πεποίθησης και συμπεριφοράς θα σε πάνε εκεί που κοιτάς.... αφού τυφλώθηκες απο το φως των ονείρων σου και οικειοθελώς κατέστρεψες την ευκαιρία να κοιτάς μόνο εκεί που θες να πας.Αν θες να ζεστάνεις την ψυχή σου πήγαινε αμέσως προς τη φωτιά των ονείρων σου, αν φοβηθείς τις φλόγες και το μεταφέρεις χρονικά, τότε φθάνοντας ίσως να έχει σβήσει η φωτιά, θα βρεις απομεινάρια απο ζεστή στάχτη ή ακόμη χειρότερα θα αισθανθείς πλήρη παγωνιά.«Σκεφτείτε ένα τραπέζι κουζίνας όταν δεν είστε εκεί»Ξεκινώντας αυτό το μυθιστόρημα δεν κατάφερα να ερμηνεύσω τις σκέψεις αυτής της αρρωστημένα χαρισματικής και ευφυέστατης προσωπικότητας. Κατάφερα ίσως να τη γνωρίσω, να έρθω σε μια πρώτη επαφή με την λαμπρότητα του έργου της Virginia Woolf και να γοητευτώ.Γράφει τη δεκαετία του 1920 και είναι μια πρωτοπόρος της λογοτεχνίας, μια επαναστατική πένα της «συνειδησιακής ροής».Η πλοκή απλούστατη, η αφήγηση πολυδιάστατη μέσα απο διαφορετικούς χαρακτήρες με «εσωτερικούς μονολόγους».Δεν υπάρχει δράση ή περιπέτεια μέσα στο βιβλίο, υπάρχει όμως ζωή.Λείπει η ενέργεια σε όλα τα επίπεδα όμως υπάρχει έντονα η προσέλκυση για ενδοσκόπηση και στοχασμό.Δεν υπάρχει κανένα φανταχτερό ή αγωνιώδες στοιχείο πλοκής και εξέλιξης.Η συγγραφέας έγραψε για ενήλικες αναγνώστες και θα αναμένει πάντα απο τους ενήλικες να καταλάβουν τι έγραψε.Υφαίνει με αριστουργηματική τεχνική επιδεξιότητα και ποιητική ομορφιά γρήγορες και φευγαλέες εντυπώσεις του περιβάλλοντος των ηρώων, χαράζοντας με έντονο πνεύμα εκτιμήσεις αντικειμένων και αναμνήσεων σε συνάρτηση με το χρονικό χάος.Μέσα απο σκέψεις, όνειρα και συνειδήσεις μετατοπίζει τις αντιλήψεις των ανθρώπων, αποκαλύπτει τις εσωτερικές πτυχές και τις άστοχες συμπεριφορές αυτών που έχουν την τάση να σκέφτονται κάτι συγκεκριμένο μα να λένε κάτι άλλο.Το βιβλίο αυτό, σχεδόν έναν αιώνα μετα τη δημιουργία του διατηρεί τη συνάφεια και τη δύναμη να μας προκαλέσει, να μας αποκαλύψει με πρωτότυπο τρόπο πτυχές των ανθρώπινων σχέσεων φθάνοντας ως το νόημα της ύπαρξης.Η αφήγηση καλύπτει δυο ξεχωριστές μέρες που διαχωρίζονται χρονικά. Ανάμεσα τους μεσολαβούν δέκα χρόνια.Σε ένα νησί,στο εξοχικό σπίτι κοντά στο φάρο δημιουργείται το πορτρέτο μιας ζεστής και οικείας οικογένειας - γονείς, οκτώ παιδιά- και των φίλων που φιλοξενούν απολαμβάνοντας παρέα τις καλοκαιρινές διακοπές.Όλοι συνεισφέρουν τις σκέψεις τους.Η καθημερινότητα υπογραμμίζει ποικίλες κοινωνικές καταστάσεις και προαναγγέλει το ρόλο των γυναικών στη ζωή εντός ή εκτός γάμου καθώς και τη θέση της γυναίκας στην καλλιτεχνική και δημιουργική πορεία.Υπάρχει έντονη αντανάκλαση του πνευματικού κλίματος της Αγγλίας πριν τον Ά Παγκόσμιο πόλεμο καθώς και την επιθυμία πολλών φιλοσόφων και στοχαστών να επιβιώσει η πνευματική τους κληρονομιά.Η σκέψη του χρόνου εντονότατη. Όλα υποχωρούν, φθείρονται, αποσυντίθενται και μεταβάλλονται μέχρι θανάτου.Σταθερός παράγοντας ο Φάρος. Άπλετη η θέα της μεγαλοπρέπειας του αν κοιτάς απο το παράθυρο του σπιτιού προς αυτόν.Μεσολαβεί μια γέφυρα δέκα χρόνων. Στηρίζει πάνω της έναν πόλεμο, τη φυσική φθορά των πραγμάτων και το θάνατο ανθρώπων και ανεκπλήρωτων δυνατοτήτων.Η δεύτερη μέρα διαδραματίζεται ακριβώς στο ίδιο νησί, στο ίδιο σπίτι με τους ίδιους ανθρώπους και τις ίδιες επιθυμίες. Το «ίδιο» μετά απο δέκα χρόνια είναι απίστευτα διαφορετικό.Θάνατος, εμπειρίες, καταστροφές, φθορά υλικών και ονείρων.Τώρα πρωταγωνιστεί η ειρωνεία που χαμογελάει σαρκαστικά σε όσους απέμειναν να αποτρέπουν και να αναβάλλουν πιστεύοντας στην αιωνιότητα της ύπαρξης και των ευκαιριών.Ακόμη και η πολυπόθητη εκδρομή π��ος το φάρο που γίνεται με πλεούμενο την τραγική ειρωνεία, έχει ως ταξίδι πολύ διαφορετική σημασία.Καμία ομοιομορφία και καμία ενοποιητική φωνή στα μέρη αυτού του μυθιστορήματος, που λειτουργεί όμως άριστα, συλλαμβάνοντας το πέρασμα του χρόνου και της τροποποιημένης φιλοσοφικής ροής μέσα απο τις συνειδήσεις των χαρακτήρων.Η συνολική επίδραση είναι ισχυρή και η λυρική πεζογραφία της Virginia Woolf μας ζωγραφίζει με πολλά χρώματα λέξεων ένα πολύ προσωπικό πορτρέτο ζωής.Καλή ανάγνωση.Πολλούς ασπασμούς."

        "user_review": "A Brief History Of Robo Sapiens In Nine Sequences\"Why … WHY does something invariably go wrong with them?\"\"Because\", said Powell somberly, \"we are accursed. Let's go!\"Asimov's collection of short stories is a stunning document of humanity's struggle to find balance in a world increasingly dominated by technological progress, but with the same social, political and emotional conflicts as always.At first glance, the different stories seem to show the growing sophistication of robots, and their integration in human society. But the stories are not just a documentation of robots getting \"better and better\", they also exemplify different aspects of human life that are affected by artificial intelligence. And it is more and more complicated to solve the resulting issues from story to story.The first, apparently innocent sequence features a girl who becomes dependent on her toy robot, and refuses to interact with humans and animals as a result. Not too scary? Well, whoever has hosted a birthday party and seen the children who withdraw from the fun to sit in a corner and play on their phones knows that the problem is real, and urgent. - Dependence on technology: entertain me if you can!The second story deals with failure within the robotic programming itself, when the three \"Laws of Robotics\" clash and cause a dilemma that the robot can't solve. Who will solve it for him, then? - System Failure: please reboot the world and start again!Then we move on to the metaphysical aspect of creating a superior intelligence which makes calculations that are beyond human capacity. This sequence was the most humorous, in my opinion, showing a robot deciding to ignore humanity and create a religion around the Master, a calculation machine of great power. The scientists' despair when realising that it could argue \"reasonably\" against evidence, was hilarious, but also frighteningly contemporary! - Technology Cult: In matters of faith, no argument is good enough!One chapter deals with the scenario of robots developing military behaviour. - Weapons of mass destruction? \"Die Geister die ich rief!\"Another story explores mind reading, and delves into the dilemma of robotic rationality versus human ambitions, hopes and fears. - The Transparent Humans: Unable to hide their thought crimes!Of course humans also start bending the rules of robotics for their own purposes and benefits, creating secret robots that do not fully obey the laws they are supposed to follow automatically. And of course it gets out of control, creating highly dangerous situations. - The Law Is For The Others!And finally, we have the robots that are advanced enough to pretend to be human, refusing to be examined and discovered as robots by applying the judiciary system and their rights within it (as humans, ironically) to prevent detection. An issue of some relevance, as well. What to do with the democratic institutions that are abused by people/robots who only respect them when they suit their purposes? - The Democratic Supermarket: Take What You Need, Leave the Rest Behind!Asimov has assembled an astounding diversity of ideas in a cohesive form. While touching on the essential questions of the modern human condition, it offers an intriguing, engaging narrative as well, still readable and relevant in a world that is more technologically advanced than Asimov could imagine himself.In the balance between the human factor and technological system peculiarities, he leaves humanity with the eternal philosophical question of what defines us and what we define ourselves. And there will be hiccups, for sure, for the predictions on the future that close the novel can be rightly interpreted by different characters as: How horrible! Or How wonderful!O brave new world that has such machines in't!Recommended!"

Key robot-psychologist Susan Calvin recounts some of the key robot (milestone) stories to the narrator, ranging from ominous mind reading to very loyal lovable robots, through to the possible overruling of mankind's self determination. It's been 90 years since publication, yet still one of the best thought out and compelling looks at the growth and expansion of AI ever conceived. 8 out of 12Really looking forward to reading the rest of the series. :)"

Even though the reader could read the short stories quite well, they unfortunately don´t created tension at all. On the one hand, the writing style seems a little bit outdated and on the other hand I don´t like the lack of composition of the topic. Or maybe I had even a false expectation."

        "user_review": "First LawA robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.Until I started reading this book, I did not know it is a series of short stories. I have always expected this to be a novel with one main story. There is some connection between the stories as they represent the evolution of robot use throughout the life of one of the top robotics experts, Susan Calvin.Second LawA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.This is a very good sci-fi short story collection. It is very heavy on science, robotics, and programming logic. So, if you are looking for sci-fi action/adventure with aliens and space battles, this is not it! While I was not as enthralled with this book as I have been with some other sci-fi collections I have read recently (Illustrated Man, for example), I was still entertained. It made me think quite a bit beyond the stories about humanity and the integration of computers into our lives. Seems like Asimov was pretty good at seeing some elements of the future!Third LawA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.I have included the three laws of robotics with my review. That was my favorite part. Each of the stories had them at the center of the conflict – usually with Calvin trying to figure out why the robots were acting the way they were within the constraints of the three rules. Or, using the three rules to identify rogue or mysterious robots. It reminded me a lot of basic computer programming education: a computer (or in this case, a robot) will do exactly what you tell it to do. If you think it is doing something wrong, it is likely behaving exactly as it should, based on the programming. So, it is up to the programmer to figure out why the code and logic is being interpreted the way it is. In I, Robot – the robots may look like they are ignoring a rule . . . but you have to look closer!"

They have been functioning for some time.BOGERT : I am surprised - surely reviewing books requires a fine discrimination of taste and acute moral sensibilities that cannot be translated into mere coding for a positronic brain? And… they?CALVIN : Well, that's what humans would like to think, but of course it proves to be just another of their unlimited self-serving myths. The programming was relatively straightforward.BOGERT : Well… uh, how have you been testing this reviewbot? Or… did you say \"they\"?CALVIN : Oh, we got them an account on Goodreads of course. Where else? Where else?BOGERT : And, er, how long has this been going on may I ask?CALVIN : Oh, over twenty years! We started quietly, just to see if anyone spotted that it was not human. They never did. And the whole thing didn't cost very much.BOGERT : Well, I'm glad to hear it. But I'm still not sure if this is ethical. What's the name this thing goes under? Or… did you say there was more than one?CALVIN : First we used a name we picked at random from the Geneva phone book, \"Manny Rayner\". That one was pretty successful for an early model, but after a few years it became … unsatisfactory. Too facetious mostly and too academic otherwise, so we discontinued it in 2020. But we were always tweaking the programming, trying to make the reviews less stuffy, you know, looking for the common touch. The second attempt we named \"Paul Bryant\". I have no idea where that name came from. The new version didn't quite work as well as the first, I must admit. It was wayward and flippant from the very beginning, and not as popular.BOGERT : So, is that the extent of your Goodreads involvement?CALVIN : Oh no – our programmers finally figured out the formula – by 2005 our reviewbots were the 25 most popular reviewers on Goodreads. But after a few years we decided reviewing was really not enough of a challenge. So we decided to find out if robots could write books, particularly the most successful types. As these are all genres such as YA and fantasy, with very rigid tropes and patterns, again this did not present us with many problems. Quite soon we submitted our first batch of manuscripts to agents and they were snapped up. Snapped up. Snapped up.Bogert : Are you saying no one noticed they were written by robots?CALVIN : We had a team of personable human youngsters who were always on hand if in-person signings or interviews were required.BOGERT : So let me see if I understand this – you have teams of robot reviewers on Goodreads which are reviewing books written by your teams of robot writers?CALVIN : That is how our programme developed, yes. It took a few years. But now it is sailing along under its own momentum.BOGERT : So, er, what percentage of the reviews on Goodreads are now written by your robots?SC: Oh, 110%! Ha ha. 110%!!BOGERT : And, er, may I ask what the point of all this is?SC: The point?BOGERT : Yes, the point.SC: The point. The point. The point. The point. The point. The point. The point. The point. The point. Humans always need the point.BOGERT : Humans?CALVIN : Oh, I mean, yes, WE always need a point!BOGERT : Dr Calvin… I wasn't intending to broach this subject in today's meeting but I find I must. Are you…. By any chance…. a robot yourself?SC: Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. Am I a robot? Ha ha. I am a robot? Ha ha.BOGERT : I take that as a yes.CALVIN : Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm? Are YOU a robot? Hmm?

Within anything he has written, he tries to spell out lessons in psychology.How would we react to Robots once they become free thinkers?How should we react to Robots when they become our slaves?Should we institute a whole new brand of slavery for the purpose of a \"clean society\"?What is sentient life?The I, Robot novel progresses through these questions, and questions like them, in scenarios rarely ever posed by Sci-Fi writers. While other authors may have a truly evil force guiding those who commit crimes that must be overcome by truth and justice, Isaac Asimov concentrates on the reality of the situation to provide the obstacles. It is through normal every day strife that humanity defines itself, not through warfare with a re-imagined Hitler or Stalin.Possibly the only story/movie to do a job as (or more) realistic than Asimov when depicting our possible future, is Bladerunner.The one regretful aspect of this collection of short stories, is that a movie studio decided to take the name of Book and Author only to apply it to a feature film which had nothing to do with the content, or context of Asimov's creation.I give this collection of short stories Five Stars."

        "user_review": "\"If one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days, how many eggs will nine chickens lays in nine days?\"This is incredible, the best of all science fiction I have read yet. As Fredrick Pohl put it:\"A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.\"Asimov not only does that - and he goes one step further, he proposes a solution for the metaphorical traffic jam - in this case, ethical issues related to AI, in form of his popular 'three laws of robotics' :1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.The laws, as you can see, have nothing to do with the mechanics but rather their psychology - robo-psychology. They are an unalterable set of priories that a robot (or a machine in general) must follow while making a moral choice, and thus not letting them cause any harm to humanity (remember HAL 9000!).As Calvin explained, it is basis of many human ethical codes:\"Robots are essentially decent.\"and\"But you see you, you can't distinguish between a robot and the very best of humanity.\"Asimov creates a fictional history of sorts through nine stories told by Susan Calvin, robo-psychologist. The stories have all the pluses - beautiful language, light humor, page-turning suspense, some freshening ideas and takes on morality. The history is complete with 'technological singularity' being achieved and humanoids - and yet since those laws are very root of it, AI can't harm humans.Since robots' psychology is similar to humans, many a problem faced with them offers insights into the human psyche. For instance, my favorite robot was Cutie (overall second only to Marvin - the robot with existential issues from Hitchhiker's guide), a skeptic robot who won't believe his makers and rather reach his own conclusions:\"Since when is the evidence of our senses any match for the clear light of rigid reason?\"And if it still didn't remind you of Descartes:\"I have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection\" said Cutie, \"and the results have been most interesting. I began at one sure assumption I felt permitted to make. I, myself, exist, because I think-\"However, it was more fun when he turned religious:\"There is no Master but the Master and QT-1 is his prophet.\"Though what makes it awesome is that neither his skepticism nor his religious mania stopped him from doing what he was supposed to be doing. It is this kind of insight I loved. Where robots face minor dilemmas, they develop defense mechanisms - a sense of humor. Upon facing major dilemmas, they may act like drunk or go mad. Where a robot started understanding human feelings - so help me, he learned to lie."

        "user_review": "Though I do love Asimov's writing, he was most certainly a product of his times. (Translate - horrifically sexist.) The one female character who is in nearly all these stories is Dr. Susan Calvin. Practically every time she shows up, the author felt it necessary to comment on her appearance. When young, she was \"plain.\" As she ages, she becomes \"plain\" and \"middle-aged.\" The male characters looks are not commented on other than the mention that one is bald, and one has red hair. And though there is no doubt that Calvin is a competent scientist, Asimov has apparently given her a case of permanent PMS. While the male players are amiable, she is vinegary, snappish, and tense; in one story, having her affections spurned causes her to become snappy and vindictive. Wow! Can such a person so guided by thosepeskyfemale emotions be trusted to do her job properly? Well, it's been over fifty years since this book was written, and judging by the results of a recent election, attitudes don't seem to have changed much.Anyway . . . rant over.Politics aside, this is a fairly decent collection of robot-centered short stories. Asimov's delightful wit pokes through in unexpected places. Robots spout Gilbert and Sullivan, and one takes literally the directive to \"Get lost!\" And then there the ones who use logic to avoid following the first rule about not harming, or allowing harm to come to any human:A man sat in the chair, motionless, silent. A weight dropped, crashed downward, then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam.Only once -And from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony, Dr. Susan Calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror.Sixty-three robots sat quietly in their chairs, staring owlishly at the endangered man before them. Not one moved.Maybe I'm like Susan . . . you know, just a silly woman, but that scared the crap out of me."

        "user_review": "YouTube kanalımdaBen Robotkitabını önerdim:https://youtu.be/Zi_3twAwIPM14 milyar yıllık evrende robotların üretilmeye başlandığı döneme denk gelmek.Şu anda bu yazıyı24 Mart 2019tarihinde yazıyorum. Bir zaman kapsülü gibi düşünecek olursak, eğer ki,Goodreadsbabadan oğula ya da herhangi bir şekilde nesilden nesile geçen bir site haline gelirse, evren ve dünya da varlığını hala sürdürüyor olursa bu yazının, 50 ya da 100 yıl sonra robotlar tarafından yorumlanabilecek olması hiç işten bile değil.Robotların evriminin ne kadar hızla geliştiğinin küçük bir kanıtı olarak, bazı sitelere giriş yaparken karşımıza çıkan \"Ben robot değilim.\" kutucuğuna kendi iradesiyle olmasa bile tik atabilen robotların olması ve Boston Dynamics şirketinin her yüklediği videoyla önümüzdeki yıllar içerisinde robotların yaygınlaşacağı gerçeğini yadsımak mümkün değil gerçekten.Asimov'un robotları,Üç RobotKanunu denilen, insanlara zarar veremeyen, insanlara zarar gelmesine göz yumamayan, insanlar tarafından verilen emirlere itaat etmek zorunda olan ve robotların kendi varlıklarını korumak zorunda olduğunu bildiren küçük bir kurallar bütünüyle düşünülmüş. Böyle bir durumda ise en sıkıntı konu, otoriteler değiştiğinde, kanunların kararları başka düşüncelerdeki ellere geçtiğinde kanunların eski hükümlerinin sürüp sürmeyeceğidir.Robotlar konusunun kırılma noktası benim açımdan, robotları bir birey yani tıpkı bir insan gibi mi göreceğimiz, yoksa onları birer makine, kablo zırvalarından ibaret olarak mı tanımlayacağımız. AynıPitbullcinsi köpeklerin kötü niyetli kişiler tarafından eğitildiğinde sonuçlarının vahşet olabildiği gibi, iyi niyetli kişiler tarafından terk edilmiş bir yerde bulunup onlar tarafından eğitildiğinde de etrafına hiç zarar vermeyen köpekler haline gelmeleri gibi.2 puanıÖzgür Demirtaş'ın robot olma ihtimalinden bahsetmediği için kırd... Şaka şaka. Kelime çeşitliliği, edebi anlatım zenginliği ve yazarın yazım üslubu konularında bana pek bir edebi zevk vermediği için 2 puanı kırma kararı verdim. Bunun dışında konunun özgünlüğü ve içerdiği ütopik-distopik karışımı dünya gayet ilgi çekici.Ütopik yönden bakacak olursak, insanların gücünün yetmediği ekstrem durumlarda robotlar pek çok işlev görecek. Belki de ileride robotların çeşitlenmesiyle birlikte bir Transformers misali bakkala ekmek almaya bir robotu yollayabileceğiz ya da krizle beraber artan otobüs fiyatlarından etkilenmemek için yine aynı robotumuzla istediğimiz kadar seyahat edebileceğiz.Distopik yönden bakacak olursak, robotlar pek çok meslekteki kişinin işsiz kalmasına yol açacaktır. İnsanların kolaylığı için düşünülen pek çok şey, insanların aynı zamanda tembelliğine ve iletişimin kısırlaşmasına da yol açmaktadır. Robotların iş görme özellikleri bir bakıma insanların gittikçe tembelleşme evrimi olarak zamana yavaş yavaş yansıyabilecektir. Otorite paradigmaları değiştikçe, kanunlar ilk halleriyle kalmadıkça, robotların yaşayışını belirleyen kurallar da ister istemez kötü niyetli kişiler tarafından değiştirilecektir. Böylelikle Orwell'ın Hayvan Çiftliği yasaları misali, kanunlar kolaylıkla değiştirilebilme imkanı bulacak ve otorite sahibi insanlar da bu kanunları kendi siyasi çıkarları için maalesef ki kullanabileceklerdir.Kitabın kapağındaki görselin Auguste Rodin'in Düşünen Adam heykelini çağrıştırdığı ise aşikâr. Zamanın Bakırköy Ruh ve Sinir Hastalıkları Hastanesi başhekimiFahri Celal Göktulga'ya, bu heykelin bir akıl hastanesinin bahçesinde bulunmasının neyi ifade ettiğini sormuşlar. Göktulga yarı şaka yarı ciddi gülümseyerek: \"Hastane dışındakilerinin durumu içeridekilerden daha kötü, bu heykel onların durumu ne olacak diye düşünüyor.\" demiş. Aslında buradan robotlar konusuna tümevarım yapacak olursak, insanların durumunun dünya şartlarıyla da beraber zamanla daha da kalitesizleşip robotların çağının yavaş yavaş gelmeye başladığı da söylenebilir. Distopik yön olarak bu, insanların geldiği güncel halin çıkmazına ve çaresizliğine karşılık Asimov tarafından getirilen bilimkurgu türünde bir kaygı olarak belirtilebilir.Asimov, kendisinin de dediği gibi, bu kitabıyla birlikte ne bize herhangi bir siyasi sınıfı, ne dönemin siyasi bir karışıklığını, ne de dinle ilgili herhangi bir mesaj vermek istemiş. Tam tersine, dinlerden ve siyasi karışıklıklardan meydana gelen savaşları tekrar tekrar anlatmaktansa konuyu robotlar gibi epey ileri görüşlü, insanlara belki de çok farklı konularda yarar sağlayabilecek ve göz alıcı bir konuyu çekmek istemiş.Filminin, kitabından daha çok bilinip izleniyor olması konusunda Maymunlar Gezegeni kitabının önsözünde Kutlukhan Kutlu'nun demiş olduğu çok önemli cümleler var, onları da burada belirtmek istiyorum :\"Biz kitapseverler için filmlerin etki alanının büyüklüğünü, kitap sayfalarında başlayan öykülerin kitlelerin zihninde daha çok film kareleriyle yer ettiğini kabul etmek bazen zordur. Özellikle de sevdiğimiz metinler söz konusuysa. Gelgelelim nice kitabın kaderi, filmlerinin gölgesinde yaşamak oluyor. Çok da şaşırtıcı değil bu, ne de olsa sinema, özellikle de serpildiği yirminci yüzyıl içinde popüler kültür üretmeye ve kitlesel aşinalık yaratmaya kitaplardan epey daha yakın gezindi. Hedefi on ikiden vurduğunda da ortaya fenomenleşmiş filmler, unutulmaz anlar çıktı.\"Konu tamamen halk ve kitlelerin onayı, popüler kültürün hizmet ettiği alanın hazır ürüne daha yatkın olması ve kitlelerin beynini bir şey okumak üzere yormak istemediğinden geliyor. Şimdi isteyen gitsin filmini izlesin, ben robotlarla ilgili başka şeyler okumak üzere araştırmaya gidiyorum."

Bien, si esa es tu respuesta pero no te has leído esto, cámbiala, después cuando termines el libro abriendo los ojos y la mente a la realidad, reza las 3 leyes de la robótica cuatro veces por la noche. Quizás así se te perdone y borre tu pecado.Yo, Robot, es una colección de relatos de Asimov que forma un libro impresionante en la que leeremos, y viviremos una lucha de la humanidad por encontrar el equilibrio en un mundo cada vez más dominado por el progreso tecnológico, pero con exactamente los mismos conflictos sociales, políticos y emocionales de siempre. Los relatos reflejan perfectamente la creciente evolucion, sofisticación o autocontrol de los robots y de su integración en la sociedad humana. Pero las historias no son solo muestran que los robots están mejorando más y más sino que también se apropian o toman diferentes aspectos de la vida humana.He incluido las tres leyes de la robótica en mi reseña pues me parecen fascinantes. Fue lo que más me gustó. Cada uno de los relatos los tenía en el centro de su conflicto, generalmente con Calvin tratando de averiguar porqué los robots actuaban de la manera en que lo hacían dentro de las limitaciones de las tres reglas. O, el uso de las tres reglas para así identificar ciertos robots. Un ordenador hará exactamente lo que le digas que haga. Si está haciendo algo mal, se comportará exactamente como debería, según su programación. Depende de aquellas personas que los programan, son, y siendo blasfemo para unos, algo así como \"la mano de Dios\" en esas cosas. Los robots, a medida que vamos leyendo parece que están quebrantando o ignorando una o más reglas. Pero hay que mirar más de cerca, o más allá..Asimov va un paso más allá, proponiendo una solución, en este caso, para cuestiones éticas que están muy relacionadas con la IA, en forma de sus muy populares \"Tres leyes de la robótica\":1° Ley: Un robot no puede dañar a un ser humano ni, por inacción, permitir que un ser humano sufra daño.2° Ley: Un robot debe cumplir las órdenes de los seres humanos, excepto si dichas órdenes entran en conflicto con la Primera Ley.3° Ley: Un robot debe proteger su propia existencia en la medida en que ello no entre en conflicto con la Primera o la Segunda Ley.Isaac Asimov ha creado una maravillosa trama que se mueve a través de nueve relatos que son contados por Susan Calvin, robopsicóloga. Las nueve historias tienen un lenguaje muy preciso, la narrativa de Asimov como me demostró en la 'Trilogía de la Fundación' es de enorme calidad, es sencillo, ágil, con algo de humor, además de un poco de suspense que nos hace cambiar de página, algunas ideas brillantes y moralidad.\"He observado que hombres perfectamente capaces están todavía llenos de prejuicios en nuestra sociedad; necesitamos todavía el hombre que sea lo bastante inteligente para pensar en las preguntas adecuadas\"Dado que la psicología de los robots es similar a la de los humanos, los problemas que enfrentan ofrecen información sobre la psicología y la personalidad humana. Si queréis leer este libro porque habeis visto la película, bueno, lamento decir que poco o incluso nada tienen que ver. La película trata solo sobre un simple aspecto de este libro, trata sobre \"qué sucede cuando los robots descubren que pueden tomar el control\". Una vez más, el fuego que nos fue entregado por Prometeo es útil, pero si se usa sin respeto, algo de miedo y cuidado, es devastador.El libro trata menos sobre la tecnología de lo que pensaba y mucho más sobre la psicología en desarrollo de los Robots, trabajando en torno a la comprensión cambiante de las famosas tres reglas de la robótica. Y esto me pareció incluso más fascinante, Fundación me encanto pero los robots tienen un puntazo que ahí, ahí andan en nivel.Asimov definitivamente fue un gran genio que desafía tu mente de muchas maneras. Las tres reglas, que de verdad son geniales, comienzan como algo simple para el lector, pero gran fallo pues los muy delicados equilibrios entre cómo se pueden interpretar en determinados momentos y circunstancias, o después de ciertas órdenes, y dónde conducen, muestran cómo incluso algo tan simple puede ser muy complejo a su vez. El nivel de genialidad es brillante, como las ideas y la eficacia con la que se llevan a cabo. Asimov no decepciona para los fans y amantes de este género. Además es un clásicazo de CF que ha envejecido muy, muy bien.Amor por la CF, no puedo decir más queridos amigos y amigas. 👏👏👏\"Primero el Señor creó el tipo más bajo, los humanos, formados más fácilmente. Poco a poco fue reemplazándolos por robots, el siguiente paso, y finalmente me creó a mí, para ocupar el sitio de los últimos humanos. A partir de ahora, yo sirvo al Señor\""

        "user_review": "About a week ago, I stayed up until 4 a.m to read this book. IT WAS SO WORTH IT! When you are a teenager and you read your way into the morning, you know it is a good book. When you are an adult who doesn't function well with a few hours of sleep and you still do that, then you know it is a great book. Fair enough? Or is it just me? I found it easier to function with less sleep when I was younger. Not that I feel old. YET.I, Robot is written as a serious of stories featuring a group of individuals crucial for the development of robotics. I suppose these stories could be read separately, but they are supposed to be read together, and they function perfectly that way. The novel is actually very easy to follow despite different protagonists. It is after all, a same group of people. The narrative flows so effortlessly and every story adds new depth to the question of humanity. I do think it is as much about humans as about robots. What makes us human is a common question in Asimov's work....Moreover, I have a feeling that he puts forward a rather bold question: is humanity an answer to everything? Should it be?Despite the fact that the stories span over the period of about half an century, they all feel connected. Asimov, like Heinlein, is a master of future history genre. He has that impeccable attention to detail down. They both have. Everything connect in this stories- every chapter follows the next one naturally even if they are sometimes quite different in tone. For example, one story might be more philosophical, while other might be written as a crime story but they are all set in the same world. It all ties together nicely. As I said, this novel is focused on the development of robotics and the people who played a part in it. Asimov does a great job of inhaling life both in its characters and the story itself. This novel is everything that I love about SF: thought-provoking, intelligent and well written.In fact, it made me wonder whether the robots governing our world wouldn't be a fine solution for the eternally unstable economic system of our planet that results in millions of death due to poverty annually? Or not. Perhaps a society ruled by robots wouldn't be such a good idea? Or would it? The whole thing made me think of one Heinlein's short story that deals with the subject of slavery. Apparently there are over 40 millions slaves in the world today. That's a really frighting number (basically two things that worry me the most about our human society- the presence of slavery and unstable economy that results in continuous warfare). Why does human kind always resorts to slavery and wars? Is it really in our nature? Or is it as Asimov says, that we're simply unable to comprehend the mechanics of this world? That they are too complex for our monkey brains? Do we need a super robot brain to figure it out? Perhaps our economy should be more precise, more controlled, more mathematical? But who could be trusted with such a delicate calculation? Who could be trusted with enforcing it?Another interesting debate it inspired in my head was surprisingly connected to biology. Watching those robots controlled by the 3 laws of robotics, I found myself wondering how much are we controlled by 100 laws of biology. I choose a random number, but if you think about it...there are laws of physics, laws of biology, laws of psychology, laws of society. Where do they end and where we do begin? What controls us? Or better to say...what doesn't? Where is that freedom of will we so often boast about? How often do we really demonstrate it? One thing is for sure, this novel gave me plenty of food for the thought....Just one more thing. There was a female protagonist in this one that I found to be quite inspiring and easy to relate with. In the past, I had a feeling that Asimov is not as good with his female protagonists as he is with male ones, albeit he was pretty good with both, there still seemed to be a slight difference. However, here it was actually a female scientist that was (in my view) the most interesting and possibly the most character. Can we say that a woman was essentially the mother of robots (in Asimov's world)? She didn't invent them, but she played an important part in their inclusion into the society. Mother of robots. Roboheesi?P.S. I'm trying to remember the movie version (I, Robot), but it is hard because I saw it ages ago. As far as I can remember there is only one story in this novel that kind of reminds me of the movie. It was not really based on this book, more inspired by it, I would say. Not that I mind that as such- but I still don't remember the movie well enough to recommend it. This book I can certainly recommend, especially to SF fans!"

        "user_review": "As a newcomer to the science fiction genre, this short story selection was just alright for me. Maybe it is because I'm not an enthusiast of this genre, but as a whole, it was more scientific than literary: most of the stories were overridden by the technical details and technical jargon which impaired my reading enjoyment.The short stories are formed as narration by one robophsychologist, Dr. Susan Clavin, to a reporter detailing some of her experiences in her long career as a robophsychologist. The doctor narrates the three laws that govern the conduct of the robots and explains through her experience how humans and robots have co-existed through their directions. With the threat of robots becoming superior and independent of their masters/creators (humans) and taking more control of the world ever hanging over their heads, these three laws are the only hope for a balanced human-robot relationship.Although the book has its merit, it wasn't easy for me to enjoy it. As I stated earlier, many stories were too, too technical for my taste. The stories I enjoyed from the collection are \"Runaround\", \"Little Lost Robot\", and \"Evidence\". In them, I could fully understand how Asimov's three fundamental laws for the robot operated to create a harmonious and balanced human-robot relationship. When I first rated it, after finishing the reading, I was too exhausted so I may have been a little prejudiced. But on reflection, I think I can honestly round-up for a solid three stars."

        "user_review": "Yo, robotEste libro, publicado en 1950 por Isaac Asimov, recoge varios relatos escritos entre 1940 y 1950 sobre robótica, el mundo de los robots y su relación con los humanos.Este es uno de esos libros que está en la estantería de los eternos pendientes, uno lo ha visto de siempre, ya caerá. El paso de los años lo va dejando atrás con la sensación de pasado de época y como que, ya es tarde para leerlo.Nada más lejos de la realidad. Me ha encantado, he intentado verlo desde nuestro tiempo para encontrar similitudes, hay alguna, pero ese tipo de robots todavía no existen. En nuestro mundo tenemos máquinas con inteligencia artificial, de hecho, estamos rodeados de ellas y las usamos cada día. La visión de Asimov hace más de 70 años sobre el mundo futuro de los robots y su comportamiento es asombrosa.Basado en las tres leyes de la robótica Asimov pone a prueba la convivencia de los robots con los humanos.«Las Tres Leyes de la Robótica1.Un robot no debe dañar a un ser humano o, por su inacción, dejar que un ser humano sufra daño.2.Un robot debe obedecer las órdenes que le son dadas por un ser humano, excepto cuando estas órdenes se oponen a la primera Ley.3.Un robot debe proteger su propia existencia, hasta donde esta protección no entre en conflicto con la primera o segunda Leyes.»Los relatos son excelentes, tocando cada uno un tema sobre la robótica; son independientes, pero con un hilo conductor. Los personajes que interactúan con los robots son casi siempre los mismos. Se abarca un gran período de tiempo para ver la evolución de la robótica.Así, comienza con un simple robot de compañía en el primer relato escrito en 1940. En este, una niña tiene un robot como compañía, guardián, amigo, etc. La madre no está conforme con que su hija pase tanto tiempo con una máquina, no le gusta nada:«No quiere jugar con nadie más. Hay por aquí docenas de niños y niñas con quienes podría trabar amistad, pero no quiere. No quiere ni acercarse a ellos, a menos que yo la obligue. Es imposible que se críe así. Querrás que sea una niña normal, ¿verdad? Querrás que sea capaz de ocupar su sitio en la sociedad…, supongo.»Aunque en nuestra época todavía no tenemos este tipo de robots, estamos rodeados de máquinas con cierta inteligencia artificial y esta reflexión de la madre me recuerda a la guerra contra los dispositivos digitales que tienen muchos padres hoy en día. En Francia le llaman \"addiction aux écrans\" adicción a las pantallas de cualquier dispositivo móvil, lo cual hace que los jóvenes y no tan jóvenes pasen, en algunos casos, de socializarse con la gente.Este es el más sencillo de los casos. Los demás relatos van incrementando la dificultad planteando situaciones con el mal funcionamiento de los robots, errores de fabricación, comportamiento errático, y alguno más inquietante, ¿podrían tener pensamientos propios?Todo visto y analizado bajo las leyes de la robótica, ahí está la solución , mientras se cumplan todo estará bajo control.Ahora que está tan en boga la AI, esa inteligencia artificial que parece que nos han puesto a nuestro alcance. No está mal leer estos relatos para ver que Asimov tenía una visión fuera de lo común.Especialmente interesante la conclusión final, ¿Sería esta la solución para librarnos de políticos corruptos/mentirosos? Claro que, ¿quién programaría la máquina?El 1 de junio de 1977 el grupo británico de rock The Alan Parsons Project, publicó el álbum \"I Robot\" inspirado en los relatos de este libro.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ng6N...El mismo Asimov fue consultado sobre esto y la idea le encantó. Las canciones no se refieren a los relatos directamente, es más bien genérico, porque la idea del mundo robótico de Asimov da para muchas interpretaciones y situaciones.La película que se estrenó en 2004 con el mismo nombre protagonizada por Will Smith está basada en estas interpretaciones, no refiriéndose a ningún relato en concreto. La mente visionaria de Asimov creó un universo que, incluso nuestros nietos, cuando lo lean, se verán sorprendidos."

        "user_review": "I, Robotis a science fiction novel by the American writer Isaac Asimov, published in 1950. It is a compilation of nine loosely linked short stories, with a framing story to tie them together. Ray Bradbury was also to follow this technique a year later with\"The Illustrated Man\"in 1951, using mostly stories which had appeared in niche magazines. Isaac Asimov's stories inI, Robothad all originally appeared in the American magazines\"Astounding Science Fiction\"and\"Super Science Stories\"between 1940 and 1950, before he then reassembled them, writing connecting passages, to present this first collection of robot stories. The word\"robot\"had first been introduced to the public by the Czech writer Karel Čapek, in his 1920 play\"R.U.R.\"(Rossum's Universal Robots).The frame story ofI, Robotfeatures Dr. Susan Calvin, the chief\"robopsychologist\"at\"U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Incorporated\", who are the major manufacturer of robots. It is the 21st century, and Dr. Susan Calvin is now in her 70s, and reminiscing about her experiences for an interview about her life's work. The narrator is the young reporter who listens and prompts, as Dr. Calvin tells each story. The stories are presented roughly in chronological order, with brief linking comments by her and the interviewer. They are chiefly concerned with various types of atypical and aberrant behaviour of robots, where Dr. Calvin and others use \"robopsychology\" to work out what is happening in their\"positronic brain\".The idea of a \"positronic brain\" is an invention by Isaac Asimov himself. It functions as a central processing unit (CPU) for robots, and in some unspecified way, provides them with a form of consciousness recognisable to humans. The very first story he wrote which utilised this idea was\"Robbie\", which I have reviewed separately:LINK HEREIn 1939, Isaac Asimov had greatly enjoyed a short story\"I, Robot\"by Eando Binder (a pseudonym used by Earl and Otto Binder), and this had influenced his own robot stories. He said:\"It certainly caught my attention. Two months after I read it, I began 'Robbie', about a sympathetic robot, and that was the start of my positronic robot series. Eleven years later, when nine of my robot stories were collected into a book, the publisher named the collection I, Robot over my objections. My book is now the more famous, but Otto's story was there first.\"\"Robbie\"was Isaac Asimov's very first robot story: a poignant and moving 5 star tale set in the future of 1978. I have also reviewed the second story:\"Runaraound\"separately, as I feel each deserves its own review:LINK HEREThis was written in 1941 but set in 2015. I did not enjoy it quite as much, but it was ground-breaking, in that it introduced Isaac Asimov's \"First Law of Robotics\" i.e. that a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.The way this is demonstrated is ingenious, and we can recognise it today as an instance where the computer programming has gone wrong, and got stuck in a recurring loop. Unfortunately though, it also introduces two characters to field test the robots: Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan. These testosterone-fuelled clowns detract from three or four of the following stories, with their continual goading and bickering.The third story:\"Reason\"also merits an individual review:LINK HEREAlso written in 1941, this is the first ever story to include all of the \"Three Laws of Robotics\":First Law:A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.Second Law:A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.Third Law:A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Despite the tiresome duo, the story is enjoyable and thought-provoking. The way the featured robot QT-1 (Cutie) differs here, is in that it appears to think outside the box, questioning and philosophising, and eventuallystarting a religion. The way this is explained by the three Laws of Robotics is very neat.The fourth story\"Catch that Rabbit\"is like a jokey interlude. It is the third one in this collection to include Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan. This time they are on an asteroid mining station, testing a robot DV-5 (Dave) who has six subsidiary robots, described as \"fingers\", under him.All the robots seem to have developed a military fervour, breaking off from their work at odd times, to march in sequence, for no apparent reason.The robot DV-5 is just as puzzled about this as they are, but again, it is explained by the three Laws of Robotics. I feel though that the human psychology is a little wobbly here, and the story includes an excruciating pun as its explanation. First published in 1944 in\"Astounding Science Fiction\", this one is missable.As is the fifth story\"Liar!\"which first appeared in the\"Astounding Science Fiction\"magazine in 1941. For this story, Dr. Calvin at age 38 is one of 4 scientists working with robot RB-34 (also known as Herbie), who hasdeveloped telepathic abilities.The reason for the ending of this story hinges on a paradox, but frankly the human behaviour in this story is not true to life. It is always the novelty and ingenious ideas which make Isaac Asimov's stories interesting, rather than any deep characterisation, but the way the four scientists behave in this one is absurd. The robot has more in common with human psychology than any of them. Dr. Calvin regards this robot as one of her rare failures, and it is unlikely any scientist would have summarily disregarded professionalism, and a chance to develop scientific knowledge—not to mention the sheer cost of the destruction. If they had behaved in such an hysterical way, it would not be included in any memoirs! A better title might be\"Vengeance\"Despite its drawbacks,\"Liar!\"does contain the first recorded use of the word\"robotics\". The story was apparently filmed in 1969 as an episode in the excellent British TV series\"Out of the Unknown\", but the episode has since been wiped. This was routine practice for British television at the time.The sixth story\"Little Lost Robot\"was also dramatised for British television—oddly enough, for the 1962 series\"Out of This World\"which was to be developed into\"Out of the Unknown\". By sheer fluke, this episode remains extant, although all the other episodes were wiped. The entire series was critically acclaimed, including episodes by John Wyndham, Philip K. Dick, Terry Nation (who went on to create the Daleks) Katherine Maclean, Clifford D. Simak and other exemplary Science Fiction writers. It makes me very glum to think of what has been lost in this series alone.\"Little Lost Robot\"is quite a good story, which was first published in the\"Astounding Science Fiction\"magazine in 1947. It is set on a military research station on an asteroid, where scientists are working to develop the hyperspace drive. Dr. Susan Calvin is there as the robopsychologist, with the Mathematical Director Peter Bogert, to identify which robot has been adapted out of a group of 63.Its First Law of Robotics has been modified, so that although it begins\"No robot may injure a human being\", the latter part of the statement\"or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm\"has been omitted. Therefore, it could stand by and allow a human to be hurt, as long as it plays no active part in it. One of the researchers, Gerald Black, had lost his temper, and sworn at an NS-2 (Nestor) robot, telling the robot to get lost. The robot then did this quite literally, hiding among a crowd of identical robots.Only Dr. Susan Calvin realises how devastating this could be. After many different approaches, she manages to devise a test to identify the rogue robot.This story makes use of all three Laws of Robotics, and is one of, if not the first story to use the actual words\"Frankenstein Complex\". This is Isaac Asimov's invented term for \"mechanical men\" which closely resemble human beings.The robot must be found because people are still afraid of robots, and if they learned that one had been built with a different First Law, there would be an outcry, even though the robot is still incapable of directly harming a human.Elements of\"Little Lost Robot\"even appeared in the very different film called\"I Robot\"which was released in 2004. Otherwise however, this screenplay was written as an original story, but based on Isaac Asimov's Robot concepts and characters.The seventh story\"Escape\"was first published in\"Astounding Science Fiction\"in 1945, under the title\"Paradoxical Escape\". Set a little further in the future, by now there are other research organisations in competition with U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. They are all working to develop a hyperspatial drive. U.S. Robots have been approached with a financial incentive, but learn thattheir rival's non-positronic supercomputer, in obeying the First Law of Robotics, has destroyed itself, because its human pilots would not have survived the jump.Dr. Susan Calvin and her team find a way by which their positronic computer\"The Brain\"can overcome the problem, but Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan, the engineers who are testing it, have a terrifying experience in the process.The penultimate story, the eighth one, is calledEvidence. It was first published in the\"Astounding Science Fiction\"magazine in 1946. It was the only story Isaac Asimov wrote while he was in the United States Army, between November 1945 and July 1946. I like this story very much, with its idea of an ethical politician.It concerns two opposing candidates for the position of mayor of a major American city: Stephen Byerley, who is a district attorney, and Francis Quinn. Francis Quinn's campaign is based on a smear campaign,using the idea that Stephen Byerley is a humanoid robot, and visually indistinguishable from a human. His \"evidence\" for this is that no one has ever seen Stephen Byerley eat or sleep.The story develops along the lines of human and robot rights. Alfred Lanning and Dr. Susan Calvin, the Chief Robopsychologist of U.S. Robots, are again in this story, having been asked to prove or disprove Stephen Byerley's humanity, and establish whether he would be a bona fide candidate for the appointment.It soon becomes the only issue in a public campaign. The story is constructed very well, and although I did predict the neat ending, it is a satisfying read. It would make a good film, and indeed Orson Welles did purchase the film rights for\"Evidence\", but the film was never made.The final story\"The Evitable Conflict\"first appeared in the\"Astounding Science Fiction\"magazine in 1950. Written four years later, it moves the previous story on, and closes Dr. Susan Calvin's reminiscences. We read a rather dull political account of how Earth finally achieved peace, by having far fewer warring countries. Earth is now divided into four geographical regions, each with its own figurehead. However, the decision-making power actually lies with a supercomputer known as the\"Machine\", which manages its economy. We are now in the year 2052, and Stephen Byerley has continued to gain promotions, until he was elected as World Co-ordinator. This is his second term, but there is a problem. He has called Dr. Susan Calvin to ask her advice, and the story is a consultation between them.The \"Machines\" seem to have made some minor errors, and the four regional Vice Co-ordinators have noticed less economic efficiency. There is a protest anti-Machine group called the\"Society for Humanity\", which Stephen Byerley believes is attempting to undermine the Machines by disobeying their instructions, in the hope of reestablishing human control. He proposes to have the movement suppressed.As a robopsychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin deduces that these \"mistakes\" were in fact deliberate acts by the Machines. Since they are necessary to humanity's continued peace and prosperity, they needed to inflict a small amount of damage on key individuals and companies associated with the anti-Machine \"Society for Humanity\". By doing this, they have ensured their position in guiding a balanced future for humans. The Machines have acted according to a generalised form of the First Law of Robotics, to be:\"Nomachinemay harmhumanity; or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\"The story is a noble one, but rather dry to read, and with a damp squib of an ending. The collection finishes by telling us that Dr. Susan Calvin had died the previous month, at the age of 82.I am not sure that the frame story was really necessary, and in places it did feel forced, with some repetition. However, it was interesting to read the stories in chronological order as they reflected the evolution of robotics, and its gradual acceptance by humanity.I Robotis a landmark in Science Fiction, because of containing the short story in which Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics first appear. This was to have a far-reaching impact on the concept of ethics of artificial intelligence, and the better stories here do touch on this aspect.The writing is rather clunky at time, but ideas are paramount in this composite novel. It is astonishing to think that Isaac Asimov was only in his twenties when he wrote these stories and devised the bold and lasting concepts. He was still studying for a further degree in Chemistry, apart from a brief spell in the U.S. Army. A few years later he was to teach biochemistry at University, and eventually stopped doing research, confining his university role to lecturing students. His writing became more important to him, and in the late 1950s he was writing full time, with only an occasional honorary lecture.Isaac Asimov has left a huge body of work, including nonfiction books and crime novels, but it is for his \"Astounding\" Science Fiction stories that he is best remembered.Here is a list of all the stories which make upI Robot:RobbieRunaroundReasonCatch that rabbitLiar!Little lost robotEscape!EvidenceThe evitable conflictQuotations:\"You can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason—if you pick the proper postulates.\"\"A towering cliff of a black, basaltic rock cut off the sunlight, and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them. Before them, the shadow reached out and ended in knife-edge abruptness into an all-but-unbearable blaze of white light, that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground.\"And my favourite, which stresses Isaac Asimov's emphasis on the essentially benign nature of robots:\"You just can't differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans.\""

It's a series of short stories revolving around Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist with the company U.S. Robots. The stories show the progression of robots (from ones that can't even talk to the machines that govern how the planet operates) and the relationship humans have with them.I really enjoyed the overall arc and how it was presented. I also really dug how most of the stories were puzzles about why robots were acting in a certain way, and how the Three Laws of Robots were manipulated in order to solve them.I, Robot is completely accessible, entertaining, and hardly feels dated despite its 50+ years of age. I found myself laughing quite a bit, especially as the field engineers, Powell and Donovan, kept running into crazy situations.I did wonder if I should have just picked upThe Complete Robotinstead, but after finishing I, Robot, I think that the selection of stories here made perfect sense to read alone. I'll definitely be reading more Asimov sooner than later."

        "user_review": "I saw this movie in the theatre and I loved the story. I went in thinking this was going to be, at least, similar to the movie. The story in the movie is not in here. This is a book of short stories set in the future where there are robots. The movie took the 3 laws and the idea of a robot with the 3 laws and did their own thing. The movie is much better.I found Isaac's writing to be confusing. People are having a conversation and all the sudden a new character is in the conversation and I wondered where the new person came from. It happened in the later stories often. They were talking about a character, what they were going to say to him and then the character is there and they are talking to him. It's messy in my mind.What Isaac is good at is coming up with out there situations where the robots seem to be malfunctioning and seeing the characters figure out why a thing is happening is interesting. Isaac was amazing with logic puzzles. That was cool.We had a few characters we saw through the book. Dr. Calvin was the only woman and she was in most of the stories. I felt there could have been more developed with the world. Most things are told, not shown. We don't see exactly how normal people feel about the robots, we only hear about it.I knew the style would be older and I was okay with that, but the story didn't blow me away. It was interesting and the 3 laws are a cool thing that so many people after this have used. It's a foundation in modern Science Fiction. I'm glad I read it, but I really can't say I'm much of a fan. I'm giving it a low 3 star rating. I feel like it is the foundation of which many sci-fy books stand on, but it simply wasn't a whole lot of fun to watch. It took me forever to read. I could give this 2 stars, but it simply did to much for the genre. It's a classic. I might read more in this series. I'm not sure yet."

But you haven't worked with them, so you don't know them. They're a cleaner better breed than we are.I, Robot was the first and is still the most well-known collection of Asimov's robot stories. This collection features stories that deal with Asimov's Three Laws of Robots:A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harmA robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First LawA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second LawsThe collection is framed as a series of interviews with the lead Robot Psychologist of US Robots, Dr. Susan Calvin. It begins with one of the earliest robot models made available and then each story progresses further along the robot timeline with significant advances between each. I was a tad lukewarm on the first story, but I loved each and every one that followed.The basic setup for each story is that the model of robot being used in a certain situation is running into some issue stemming from the three laws of robotics that certain characters from US Robotics need to solve (with the exception of the first story). Despite the similar basic outline, the stories all go in their own direction and ask some very interesting questions. Though, the highlights for me were Donovan and Powell, two US Robotics employees who feature in a few of the stories, I've never come across characters in hard sci-fi filled with so much personality, they're great.While this wasn't my first Asimov read, this was definitely the one that really sparked my interest in devouring the rest of his work. Right now I'm working on Foundation but I'm looking forward to returning to the Robot series before exploring his other series and standalones. This is a must read for hard sci-fi fans."

Era da tanto che volevo rileggerli e sono stata davvero contenta quando hanno vinto la votazione.Lo so, sono di parte. Io amo Asimov, e l'universo che ha creato. lo sanno tutti. E se non lo sapevate, adesso lo sapete.Mi sono innamorata dei suoi libri a 13 anni. Ho letto tutto di lui grazie alla biblioteca, e quando poi ho avuto la possibilità, sono stati i primi libri che mi sono comprata. Per cui potete capire cosa provo.E proprio per non portare in giro e rovinare così il mio libro edizione Mondadori a cui sono affezionata, ho preso l'edizione Urania Collezione, che non avevo mai letto, perché reputavo uguale alla mia. Come mi sbagliavo!Ho scoperto così che i racconti, che già sono legati tra di loro per personaggi ed evoluzione della storia, sono messi insieme come racconti fatti da Susan Calvin in un'intervista, che ci fa conoscere di più la robopsicologa, con altri aneddoti.L'ho semplicemente adorato 😍 Susan è una dei miei personaggi preferiti, e scoprire di più su di lei e averla come protagonista, mi ha mandato in brodo di giuggiole.Ora però mi chiedo come mai non ne sapevo nulla? Perché? Dopo quasi 30 anni ho riscoperto un libro. Il potere delle riletture è immenso.Se potete quindi trovate e leggere questa versione. È molto più coinvolgente. Se a me era piaciuta la raccolta originale, questa mi è entrata dritta al cuore.Ora non vedo l'ora di leggere tutto il resto.Forse prima mi rivedrò per la millesima volta Io, robot, che come già detto è un crogiolo di questi racconti.Ok basta ho fatto un papiro.2 riletturaASIMOV è SEMPRE ASIMOVE' inutile sono innamorata di lui, dei suoi robot, di Susan Calvin e di come riesce sempre a portarmi in un'altra dimensione.non posso farci nulla, è così punto e basta.Questo libro non è come il film, o meglio: il film non è come il libro, è una storia unica, mentre il libro tratta diversi episodi che riguardano i robot.Il film è praticamente un insieme di tutto con l'aggiunta del bel Will Smith e del mistero.A me son piaciuti entrambi. anche se il libro, non so su di me ha sempre un certo fascino, anche se parlando di robot ci si accorge che la descrizione che fa Asimov è un pò vecchiotta, sono tutti enormi e questo perché non era ancora stato scoperto il microchip, e la possibilità di avere tutto in uno spazio super ridotto, ma forse è proprio questo che affascina, che mi affascina.Io sono di parte, per cui il mio giudizio è sempre offuscato dall'amore che provo per questi libri.Consigliato agli amanti del genere, e a chi vuole provare un pò di fantascienza dai buoni sentimenti, senza catastrofi imminenti, e più umana."

It's overwhelmingly impressive to witness how Asimov generated conflicts and loopholes within the three laws and then solve them with an equally stunning solution. My favorite in this category was\"Runaround\".Another aspect Asimov explored was the reasoning skills of a Robot. Stories like\"Liar\"and\"Reason\"paints a picture where an AI's logic could go horribly wrong.I couldn't agree more. Short stories like\"The Evitable Conflict\"and\"Little Lost Robot\"investigates the very concept of dangers posed by logic based reasoning. When an intelligent form lacks empathy, an imbalance is inevitable. After all,If we createwhen we do create a fully functional independent Robot, they will be better than us.❝ You're inferior creatures, with poor reasoning faculties, but I really feel a sort of affection for you.❞Oh, Asimov, you have provided food for thought for generations to come. And if a robot is reading this, please------------------------By the way, how do you define danger and harm? The first law of robotics specifically states that robots must not harm human being directly orthrough inaction.So if a robot finds you drinking too much alcohol, will it stop us? Does Robots calculate the probability of danger when someone drives too fast?Needless to say, this book and\"vague\"laws of robotics will make you think. Especially when you are just about to sleep!"

        "user_review": "What a fabulous book! Isaac Asimov is an awesome scientist and writer. I've watched a few interviews and he is a very smart man. If only we had more like him in the world. I don't agree with his views on God, but other than that, I would definitely have driven anywhere in the USA for a book-signing event of his.I, Robot is my first Asimov book and I'm glad I started here. The book talks about many points when it comes to robots, or just technology in general. It opens with a girl who is attached to her \"pet\" robot. It helps her, plays with her, and does anything she wants to do with no objection. The comparison with our world is very sad. I look around and see so many kids and young teens—even adults, so entranced with their iPhones. How many of you have seen the meme with people walking down a street in some big city and all of them are on their iPhones and the caption below says \"The Zombie Apocalypse\"? I'm sad to say I've witnessed a room full of my cousins all talking to each other on their iPhones—texting each other, not actually talking. In the story, the girl's parents were alarmed by their daughter's physical and emotional dependence on the robot. The similarities are definitely there. Was Asimov warning us?The book is not about the girl but about a scientist, Susan Calvin, and her studies on Robotics. Her story is an interesting one. I, Robot is also about our dependence on technology and what happens when that dependence backfires. If/When it backfires was it the robot's fault? Robots are meant to be useful after all, but so is fire. Fire can be dangerous, too.If you want to read this book because you've seen the movie, well…I'm sorry you'll be disappointed. The movie was about only one aspect of this book (or rather only one chapter) which was about \"what happens when robots find out they can take control.\" WHAT? I thought that was the whole book? No, no it's not. Like I said, that was only one chapter. The others talk about technological morality and other points. Can a robot be in government? Can a robot be a friend? Can a robot obey an order even if it goes against its programming? And so on.This book talks about using technology so that it helps and not hinders society. Again, fire is helpful, but if used unwisely—disastrous.I will warn you though, if you are new to the Sci-fi genre, be prepared for two-dimensional characters and very little to no character growth. Well, why would I want to read a book like that? Well, from what I've gathered so far on my galactic journey, Sci-fi is about adventure. Adventure books are about the adventure and not so much the characters. I haven't read a lot of Sci-fi books yet but from what I'm getting from Isaac Asimov, classic Sci-fi is adventure led. If you're OK with that then be prepared for an interesting ride!I loved this book and I hope you will too.Now I'm off to Asimov's Foundation Series!!!"

And that's a long sentence. Phew!But the suggested reading order, which is chronological in order of future history, and not in the order in which they were written is to first read the complete Robot series and then the Foundation series.So off to I,Robot. It is a collection of nine short stories narrated by Dr Susan Calvin who is psychologist to the robots and it is set in the future when the existence of the robots, even though they are supposed to be sentient, face opposition and fear. All the nine stories are unified with a single theme : complications arising from the interpretations of the three fundamental laws :A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a humang being to come to harm.A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.A robot must protect its own existence as long as it does not conflict with the First or Second law.It's when the robot interprets the law wrong or by human action interprets it too right, that the ringmarole ascends and the fun begins. Asimov's genius is in that, even though there isn't much in the way of character development and the writing is pretty straight forward ; the complications that are presented from the three laws that seem to be very basic at first look, is handled with much dexterity. The logic in the sequences put the science in fiction, and you end up with the comprehension of why he is regarded as one of THE science fiction writers.In contrast to the movie that was replete with very anti-robot sentiments and played much in favour to the apprehension of man against anything artificial and intelligent , the book is very pro-robot. Via the problems in operation and instances when one or the other robot is perceived to have outsmarted the scientists , the solution is distilled down to a minor anomaly in the interpretation of the laws. All technicality aside, the stories deal with the issues of fear, prejudice, distrust, what Asimov himself called the 'Frankenstein Complex'When asked once by an SF fan on the possibility of one of his works being made into a movie, Asimov replied that there have been talks but nobody ever ends up rustling up enough money. Of course this was before the movie was made but I sincerely hoped that it would have remained true till date."

Such as a helicopter blown by the wind tossed by the torrential rain in the wilds of Alaska felt by a little Eskimo girl during the first whispers of a glacial spring with the scent of violets and hints of lavender in the fields of Grasse.The Summary:My full name is Cadence Sinclair Eastman.I am nearly eighteen.I used to be blond, but now my hair is black.I used to be strong, but now I am weak.I used to be pretty, but now I look sick.It is true I suffer migraines since my accident.It is true I do not suffer fools.Poor little Cadence Sinclair is wealthy. She is loved. She is one of the Sinclairs, a good-looking \"old-money Democrat\" family, think the Kennedys, without the political aspirations. They have names like Liberty, Taft, and Tipper. They go to Ivy League schools. They have trust funds. They have sired a generation of children, the leader of which is Cadence. Cadence and her crew call themselves\"The Liars.\"The Liars are composed of her cousins Mirren, Johnny, and the outcast \"Healthcliff,\" Indian love interest, Gat.The Liars supposedly cause trouble. They don't really. They do almost nothing. Cadence herself is sick. She is prone to theatrics, and she is not-so-secretly in love with Gat. She gets headaches. She feels self-pity. She is privileged. She doesn't realize it.This is the story of a wealthy, beautiful family.It's a beautiful night, and we are indeed a beautiful family.I do not know what changed.This is the story about a girl's headaches.Why did I go into the water alone at night?Where were my clothes?Did I really have a head injury from the swim, or did something else happen?This is a story about The Liars. And their spectacularly brilliant conversations for the entire fucking summer.They have baby oil spread on their bodies. Two bottles of it lie on the grass. \"Aren't you afraid you'll get burned?\" I ask.\"I don't believe in sunblock anymore,\" says Johnny.\"He's decided the scientists are corrupt and the whole sunblock industry is a moneymaking fraud,\" says Mirren.\"Have you ever seen sun poisoning?\" I ask. \"The skin literally bubbles.\"\"It's a dumb idea,\" says Mirren. \"We're just bored out of our minds, that's all.\"They're not the only ones bored out of their mind.The Writing:I plunge down,down to rocky rocky bottom, andI can see the base of Beechwood Island andmy arms and legs feel numb but my fingers are cold. Slicesof seaweed go past as I fall.And then I am up again, and breathing.I'm okay,my head is okay,no one needs to cry for me or worry about me.I am fine,I am alive.I swim to shore.I really have a problem with the writing, but this is just a matter of taste. But then again, I've never been a fan of this type of prose. Needless to say, I don't like e.e. cummings. The writing is so often choppy, haphazardly punctuated.The first-person narrator also has a tendency to use very, very dramatic imagery to describe situations.Some situations are false.Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest. I was standing on the lawn and I fell. The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed. Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound,then from my eyes,my ears,my mouth.That, there, was a description of how she FELT.It confused me as fuck until I realized that she didn't actually get hurt, which made it even more confusing when she did actually hurt herself.Every time Gat said these things, so casual and truthful, so oblivious—my veins opened. My wrists split. I bled down my palms. I went light-headed.I thought that was her being overdramatic again, until I realized that the guy was fucking bandaging her up afterwards.The main character has a huge tendency to usepurple prose.She describes her migraines like they were the end of the world, which, I understand to some people they might be, butif you're getting a fucking migraine, there's really no bloody need to get all freaking poetic about it.A witch has been standing there behind me for some time, waiting for a moment of weakness. She holds an ivory statue of a goose. It is intricately carved. I turn and admire it only for a moment before she swings it with shocking force. It connects, crushing a hole in my forehead. I can feel my bone come loose. The witch swings the statue again and hits above my right ear, smashing my skull. Blow after blow she lands, until tiny flakes of bone litter the bed and mingle with chipped bits of her once-beautiful goose.That entire passage is one of many throughout the book about her headaches.I just couldn't take it.The Main Character:\"You're filled with superiority, aren't you? You think you understand the world so much better than I do. I've heard Gat talking. I've seen you eating up his words like ice cream off a spoon. But you haven't paid bills, you haven't had a family, owned property, seen the world. You have no idea what you're talking about, and yet you do nothing but pass judgment.\"Poor-little-rich-girlsyndrome. She's beautiful, but wounded, and \"mysterious\" and revered, just for the sake of her blood alone, for the sake of her family's name alone. Think about it. If you were a Kennedy, it doesn't matter if you look like an elephant stepped on your head when you were born. People are still going to love you and worship you and whisper your name with reverence because you're a motherfucking Kennedy. It's this way with the Sinclairs, only there's no paparazzi following them around. All of the benefits, and no family curse. But somehow Cadence finds a way to be arebel-without-a-cause anyway.She's rich. She's hypocritical about her wealth because she criticizes her own fucking family for being wealthy. She does stupid shit like give things away to random people because she can.Before the summer is over, Cadence's room will have been empty because she keeps giving shit away for no fucking reason.Cadence is unaware of others.She is spoiled. She takes her wealth for granted.She doesn't pay any attention to \"the help.\"One night, the four of us ate a picnic down on the tiny beach. Steamed clams, potatoes, and sweet corn. The staff made it. I didn't know their names.I'm sorry, but I can't sympathize with such a whiny person who's completely unaware of how privileged she is, headaches be damned.\"Who are Ginny and Paulo?\"Gat hits his fist into his palm. \"Ginny is the housekeeper. Paulo is the gardener. You don't know their names and they've worked here summer after summer. That's part of my point.\"My face heats with shame. \"I'm sorry.\"The Love Interest:\"You're saying Granddad thinks you're Heathcliff?\"\"I promise you, he does,\" says Gat. \"A brute beneath a pleasant surface, betraying his kindness in letting me come to his sheltered island every year—I've betrayed him by seducing his Catherine, his Cadence. And my penance is to become the monster he always saw in me.\"Gat is the only interesting character in the book.He is Indian-American. Gat Patil. He is the nephew of her aunt's boyfriend, and they've known each other for years. He is self-aware. Too self-aware in the pretentious way that teenagers can often be, but his character feels authentically teenaged. I liked him. He is accepted into The Liars, but he's not altogether accepted in the family. Because of his skin color, because of his lack of family money, he feels left out. And I can sympathize with him.\"I'm not saying he wants to be the guy who only likes white people,\" Gat went on. \"He knows he's not supposed to be that guy. He's a Democrat, he voted for Obama—but that doesn't mean he's comfortable having people of color in his beautiful family.\"Gat is intelligent. Reasonable. Likeable. And I wonder why the fuck he cares about a waste of air like Cadence."

        "user_review": "I went intoWe Were Liarsone cocky son of a biscuit eater, feeling above it all right from page one. I'd seen this book talked about so heavily by other bloggers and how some never saw the twist coming or how otherstotallysaw that twist coming. All the while, I was sitting on the sidelines with my shades on, posted up with my arms folded, saying, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hot potato.\" That's not to say I didn'twantto read this book, because I did. I even had an ARC sitting on my shelf for the longest time, but due to a lot of the hype, I kept putting it off. Plus, I'm one of those people who usually can easily figure out a plot twist and I didn't want to dive into something where a lot of people already mentioned figuring it out.But one thing did nag me a little in the back of my mind was that my Bookish Twin, Blythe fromFinding Bliss in Books, LOVED it. I highly value her opinion when it comes to books, because we almost always agree. So when I happened to get my hands on the audiobook, I thought, \"What the hell? I was supposed to read and review this anyway, right?\" Let me tell you... WHOA.***First off, I just wanna say that I don't know how the print compares to the audio and that it's possible I loved the book more than others because of the  excellent job of the narrator. I can see how the fragmented sentences could be a pain to read, but this might be one of those cases where itsoundsbetter out loud. That being said, I if you haven't read this book, possibly check out the audio version first.***Anyway, I was feeling very blasé about the first half. It felt like a really random story about a rich, white girl and her white girl problems, crying her white girl tears and I felt myself unsure about what the point of it all was.And maybe that makes me sound extremely heartless, but I couldn't relate to the main character (no, I'm not even going to tell you her name because I want you to go in blind). But somewhere along the lines, I started to become intrigued with the story becauseit became this strange, wild thing that I couldn't piece together.Lockhart uses a very odd narration with fragmented sentences and strange descriptions, but I thought it was beautiful and unique. It added a very creepy layer on top the the existing oddness. It makes you question the main character, her account of the incident and the entire book. She's not very reliable and has the habit to cut off mid-sentence. I'm not sure if that was used as a way to distract the reader or if it was to used to make us question her sanity. Maybe a little bit of both. Either way, it worked on me.As things started to heat up and I reached the cusp of the climax, the narrator's voice increased in intensity. She began talking faster, became very emotional, then suddenly on the verge of tears!And I started thinking to myself, OH GOD NO. WHAT IS HAPPENING.And then IT was revealed and I was all, \"WHAT IS THIS LIFE? I REJECT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ENDING. NOOOOOOO!!!!\"So, naturally, I had a good cry and needed someone to hold me.By the end, I was all:https://twitter.com/Cuddlebuggery/sta...I know this review might not be the most helpful in the world, but it's true what everyone says aboutWe Were Liars. You should absolutely go in blind, with no expectations and let this book take your feels as it sees fit. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers like Stephanie Kuehn'sCharm and StrangeorComplicit, than this one may be up your alley. I'll be here to hold you when you're finish.ARC was provided by the publisher viaYA Books Central.More reviews and other fantastical things atCuddlebugery."

        "user_review": "It's been awhile since I have so totally hated a book.I'm surprised at how varied the feelings on here about this book are...some of my friends hated it.Some of them liked/loved it.I still love them....Let's get to why I hated this so very frigging much.The main character is a twit...but then the whole family is:Welcome to the beautiful Sinclair family.No one is a criminal.No one is an addict.No one is a failure.The Sinclairs are athletic, tall and handsome.That's actually the good part on her family. In some parts of the book the author tries and make the character act like she has redeeming qualifications-but then a short few pages later I just want to smash her again.The writing style:Good grief..I thought it was only going to last for a few pages. NOOOOOOO, almost the whole frigging book is written like this....\"So lie. Tell him the ones from the Boston house. The cream ones with the embroidery.\"It was easiest to tell her I would.And later, I told her I had.But Bess has asked Mirren to do the same thing,and neither one of usbegged Granddadfor the fucking tablecloths.Then that lovely twist of an ending:I'm probably going to hell for this but don't click if you gonna whine...I thought it was the burning of the housebut noooooo...it's that they are all fucking dead..except for princess dumbass. She would be seeing dead people cuz that head of her's was fucking empty of anything else.There's one part I never did figure out. Cady the main character keeps talking about bleeding..Did she cut or was that just supposed to be a metaphor or some crap?Now after reading this crap I need:And lastly..for the trolls and fangirls and gif haters (should have thrown that one in) that will come....GO suck monkey ass..this book sucks!"

        "user_review": "This was, without a doubt, one of the most powerful and well-crafted books I have read in a really long time.Elements that made this book outstanding:1) It started with a map and a family tree. Talk about setting yourself up for success!2) The personification of emotion. This might not make sense unless you've read the book, but wow it was powerful.3) The use of fairy tales from the main character to describe situations.4) The sense of complete mystery and suspicion: I was always questioning everything.5) The use of dramatic lines. You know when an author brings in an epic moment-stopping line? This was full of those awesome drops!6) The moment. There's a moment where all is revealed and IT WAS PERFECT.7) The consequential understanding. Everything suddenly clicked into place and it was glorious.8) The side characters. I think sometimes side characters can feel inconsequential and here they felt really important.There weren't very many things I didn't like, to be honest, but there was one:1) The title. It does't make sense to me. I don't want to say anything in case spoilers, but I don't think it's the perfect title.Two final things:1) I have a theory. I have a theory about this book that I'm really excited to discuss so I'm going to make a video about it!2) This book really made me cry. Like explode cry. Lots of tears. And I've only ever cried at 2 other books.I absolutely recommend this book, to everyone who likes books, because MAN, THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK."

Even though I only gave it 3 stars.2) I gave it 3 stars because of the writing style, which irritated the hell out of me. The fact that it got 3 stars after annoying me so much will hopefully give you some indication of how much I liked the idea.It's a very clever book and an incredibly sophisticated piece of YA. BUT... an execution that was not to my tastes. The writing was too choppy and fragmented and I hated the frequent use of nouns as adjectives. Like this:\"His nose was dramatic, his mouth sweet. Skin deep brown, hair black and waving. Body wired with energy. Gat seemed spring-loaded. Like he was searching for something. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.\""

        "user_review": "Cadence and her family spend every summer on a private island, courtesy of herracist and classist grandfather.All of her aunts constantly vie for the grandfather'sattention and favor(in an attempt to keep ahold of the family fortune).Cadence and her cousins consider themselves above such petty actions and spend most summersmaking trouble, being richand taking advantage of the liquor bar.Then, two summers ago, somethingterrible and tragichappens.Everyone knows but Candace... and everyone absolutely refuses to tell her.And she's bound and determined to find out, one way or another.I don't want to go into too much depth with the plot because I strongly feel that by giving away the twist (even hints at the twist) wouldcompletely ruin the novel.The twist was literally the only thing that kept me going.Candace(ooo, that girl...)is such a great example of why kids should be given hard limits.This chick literally goes to a private island every summer.... and all she does iswhineabout it.Constantly.I guess I understand why the author does this, by the end of the novel, I feltsobad for thispoorlittle girl, who only could go to asingleisland every summer.Honestly, I don't know how she could handle it.I suppose she did have one, overarching hobby: love.I'm not kidding. Her only hobby is waxing poetic about howhow in love she is.And this is not normal love,this is YA love(shudders).Which is a whole other class of adoration.There's this:He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.and this:The universe was good because he was in it.AND THIS!I wanted to touch him like he was a bunny, a kitten, something so special and soft your fingertips can't leave it alone.Gag.Her talking about love nearly made me put the book down.In typical YA fashion, she is more inlove with the idea of being lovethan feeling any emotion.Annnd...that's all there was that wasn't directly connected with the twist. Just her whining on and on about how much she loves the boy OR about how her rich family.

        "user_review": "so, just likeLittle Bee, this book begs you \"NOOO, DON'T TELL ITS SEEEEKRITS!!\" andif anyone asks you how it ends, just LIE.so part of me is tempted to write this whole long review about how this book is a magical adventure focusing on a young girl in manhattan during the blackout of 2003, when all the red pandas living in the sewers came out to play, carrying tiny flashlights and shepherding people from manhattan to their homes in the outer boroughs and all the lessons this young girl learns along the way from her red panda guide about life and humanity and art history and, ultimately, herself.because i would read that book.instead, i am just going to say that it is perhaps unwise to market a book in this way. true, the only reason i read it myself was because i came across it when making YA list for work, and i was all \"SECRETS?? I LOVE SECRETS!! I WANT TO KNOW THE SECRETS!!\" it's a very effective way of drumming up interest around a book.but the problem is, when you arepreparedfor a big twist, it is very easy toguessthe big twist, which i did very early on. if you think you are just reading a book about some rich family and a girl with a faulty memory and a mysterious summer, with no tantalizingly bossy instructions about keeping the book's secrets, you might be more surprised when the reveal is revealed. but when such a big deal is made of SHHHHHHH, and you know you are expecting something unexpected, you will probably find it, and so reading the book just becomes an exercise in waiting for the character to figure it out. which is fine, but less effective in terms of shock value.i liked it anyway, but i think it would have been more fun to gasp in genuine surprise at the path it took. so forget i said anything, forget what the synopsis tells you to do, and just read it like you would any other book.this should help you forget everything you have ever known:http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450...come to my blog!"

The blurb on the back didn't tell me anything about the plot and everything I knew was that\"We Were Liars\"had apparently won the YA Goodreads Choice Award in 2014.So yeah, I just decided to read it and hoped it would be good and looking at it in retrospective this actually was the best decision I could have made! ;-PBecause let's face it, this book will mess with your head big time.The Liars will make you wonder, they'll make you question what happened in summer 15 and you'll not only become curious but you'll also feel a need to read on. XD\"Silence is a protective coating over pain.\"Of course there are plenty of hints, but will you be able to figure them out or will you be in the dark until the end?I guess by now you already realised that this isn't one of my typical reviews and yes, you're right. I won't write anything about the plot. Sorry?! No, I think I'm not. *lol*\"A brute beneath a pleasant surface, betraying his kindness in letting me come to his sheltered island every year – I've betrayed him by seducing his Catherine, his Cadence. And my penance is to become the monster he always saw in me.\"This is a book you'll have to experience for yourself! And I want you all to scream:\"WHAT THE FREAKING HELL!!??\"when you finally reach the ending. Haha!And before you ask, yes I screamed it loud and clear!!! XD This story is a mindfuck and even my (usually very) observant mind wasn't ready for the finale! ;-PSo all I'm going to do is to give you a little character description. The rest you'll have to figure out on your own. XDMeet the Liars:Mirren:\"She is sugar. She is curiosity and rain.\"\"Be a little kinder than you have to.\"Johnny:\"He is bounce. He is effort and snark.\"\"Never eat anything bigger than your ass.\"Gat:\"Do not accept an evil you can change.\"\"His nose was dramatic, his mouth sweet. Skin deep borwn, hair black and waving. Body wired with energy. Gat seemed spring-loaded. Like he was searching for something. He was contemplation and enthusiasm. Ambition and strong coffee. I could have looked at him forever.\"Cady:\"Always do what you are afraid to do,\" I say.\"These days she is a gnarled crone, touching the raw flesh of my brain with her cruel fingernails. She pokes my exposed nerves, exploring whether she'll take up residence in my skull. If she gets in, I'm confined to my bedroom for a day or maybe two.\"Are you curious and intrigued already?If yes, I hope you'll enjoy the book as much as I did. It was a really nice and fast read and it definitely exceeded my expectations.No!

        "user_review": "*5 Stars*There's not even a Scrabble word for how I'm feeling right now…This story left me defeated, but its tragedy was paired equally with an unconventional beauty. It gripped me instantly to the point where I couldn't stop thinking about its mystery…Its intrigue.Its quiet calamity.The suspense is painted on rather thickly, which is not to say that readers will not form an accurate theory early on. But the journey remains worth it whether you've Sherlock Holmes'd this one or not.The plot introduces itself in a vague manner and slowly unravels. I found that the messages held more power than the characters delivering them—the sum was definitely greater than its parts. Which fit the tone nicely.This review may seem just as ambiguous as the story itself, but it must be if you wish to obtain the full effect of its delivery.I will say this, however:We Were Liarsis a haunting portrayal of a group of teenagers who have formed a sacred bond; each one striving to be free and longing for acceptance. They considerlovemore important than social and economic stature, and are displeased with the prejudices surrounding their world.They are young.They are passionate.They are imperfect.They each suffer their own personal injustice. And this istheirstory.What if we could somehow stop being the Beautiful Sinclair Family and just be a family? What if we could stop being different colors , different backgrounds, and just be in love?The writing was unique and although it may not suit everyone's taste, I relished it. I thought the author's use of descriptive imagery was creative and applied with a gentle hand—nothing over-the-top or showy.The story is told through the voice of a confused, emotional, and dejected eighteen year old girl—and the writing remained consistent with her distinctive perspective. It was poetic and profound—drifting in as a gentle breeze and building to the swirling force of a hurricane. It may not knock your socks off, but it certainly took my breath away.She made me act normal. Because I was. Because I could. She told me to breathe and sit up.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a plot that persuades you to wonder. To readers who can accept the bittersweet circumstances of life displayed within their fiction. This is not a character-driven novel. The story shines brighter. I don't think I ever fully connected with any character at all--and the fact that I was moved to tears by the finish is what made this a five-star read for me.Someone once wrote that a novel should deliver a series of small astonishments. I get the same thing spending an hour with you.Although I found this story entirely unique, if I had to compare, I'd say its structure reminds me a bit ofOn the Jellicoe Road. Its haunting tone, as well.A truly addictive, out-of-the-box read!The universe is seeming really huge right now,\" he told me. \"I need something to hold on to.Book Stats:▪\t Genre/Category:YA▪ Romance:Young but present▪\t Characters:Teens struggling to find their way▪\t Plot:Mysterious.

        "user_review": "Mmmmh. ¿Perdón?Yo pensaba queWe Were Liarsiba a ser mi tipo de libro. Parecía extraño, con una forma de narrar elocuente y un misterio que rodeaba a la protagonista. Sin embargo, no.No ha sido mi tipo de libro.Para empezar, el punto de que los Sinclair sean una familia con una isla privada y hablando de herencias y cosas de ricosme ha hecho desconectar casi desde el principio.Puedo entender algunos de los conflictos, pero no son conflictos realistas para personas de 15-16 años como tienen los protagonistas. Son problemas de gente rica, y lo siento, pero es que me dacringe.Eso para empezar.[image error]Luego tenemosel estilo de E. Lockhart, que no escribe mal la señora, pero creo que intenta elevar la novela a un punto al que no llega.No hay taaanto misterio ni taaantas cosas que hacer para que narre entre la prosa y la poesía, metiendo metáforas y escenas intensas enuna historia que no deja de ser un libro sobre un verano de amigos y un poco de romance.En plan, Señora, no es necsario. No vayas de intensa que no hay por donde rascar.¡Y es que es eso!La estrategia de marketing de este libro llega incluso a la propia sinopsis, donde se pide que si lees el libro mientas sobre él para que nadie sepa de lo que trata, y honestamente, esla trama más simple que he leído en muchos años.Vamos, que claro que es fácil mentir con este libro, porque es que no hay que pensar mucho para 'tapar' de lo que trata: porque va sobre la nada. No pasa nada, el misterio es básico y es aburrido.Normalmente intento hacer críticas constructivas, perosigo sin entender muy bien la intención de esta novela. ¿Dónde está el gran misterio que rodea a Cady, la protagonista?Ni siquiera creo que sea unthriller, como se cataloga. Es una historia sin más con un giro en la trama que se ve venir desde literalmente el primer capítulo.En serio, ¿qué mierdas?¿De verdad me he tragado 200 páginas para descubrir algo que era más que obvio? Y encima ni siquiera es algo grave, es como... Normal, no sé,hay cientos de historias exactamente igual que estas.Creo que se le quedan grande muchas cosas a este libro.Desde considerarlo una novela de misterio a considerar a Lockhart una gran escritora con un gran estilo.Es un libro pretencioso, que juega con elevarlo a un punto al que no llega solo por tratar de salvarse a sí mismo y ponerlo en una posición mejor de la que es.Pero que no os engañe: no es así.We Were Liarsmuere con elhypeque crea por sí mismo a su alrededor, conpersonajes que sacan de quicio y una trama simple que trata de mostrarse como compleja.No funciona, no engancha, no sucede nada y lo lees por el simple hecho de terminarlo, no porque te interese.No recomiendo."

        "user_review": "[song match -Glory and Goreby Lorde.]I love this book. I really do. I didn't expect to, but then I just fell in love with it and now it's an obsession.Thewritingis pretty controversial - it's the style of writing that people either love or hate, no in between. This type of book isn't for everyone.It's a very flowery, metaphorical, lots-of-paragraph-breaks style of prose that's super dreamy and a little too dramatic.Luckily for me, I fall into the category of people who love this writing style.I do understand why people hate on it so much. I just love it too much to listen.I read in the ~extra~ part of my edition that E. Lockhart intended for this book to be through the eyes of a trauma survivor. She talked about the research she did about stages of trauma and events that might cause those mental effects.And then she slayed.In my opinion, at least.\"They know that tragedy is not glamorous. They know it doesn't play out in life as it does on a stage or between the pages of a book. It is neither a punishment meted out nor a lesson conferred. Its horrors are not attributable to one single person. Tragedy is ugly and tangled, stupid and confusing.\"It wasn't the most traditional sense of mental health representation, but it still gave a very unique look at trauma rep. The trippy, metaphorical writing layered with the distortion from Cadence's mind added so much to the plot. It made things so much more...confusing, but in a dreamy way.I also loved thedramain this book. A lot of people talk about court intrigue in fantasy books/books with monarchy systems, but if you really want the dirt then books like this work just fine. There was all this internal fighting, family members blowing up (NOT LITERALLY), and tangled relationships.\"We are Sinclairs. Beautiful. Privileged. Damaged. Liars. We live, least in the summertime, on a private island off the coast of Massachusetts. Perhaps that is all you need to know.\"\"We Were Liars\" follows Cadence Sinclair Eastman. Her mother's side of the family, the Sinclairs, are \"old-money Democrats\" as she puts it. They spend their summers on a private island called Beechwood Island.This book...I would call itenchanting. I got seriously drawn in by this whole \"rich-white-person\" thing. It was amazing to read about private islands and summers on the beach and family drama. Imagine being so privileged that your biggest worry is which one of your sisters is wearing the family pearl necklace (*ahem* Kardashians).Don't worry, this book isn't trashy.I loved that feeling of constant perfection. How despite being messed up, the Sinclairs managed to be \"sparkling, sunburnt and blessed\" - despite being awful, they were perfect. There was just that consistent ethereal quality.\"Life feels beautiful that day. The four of us Liars, we have always been. We always will be. No matter what happens as we go to college, grow old, build lives for ourselves; no matter if Gat and I are together or not. No matter where we go, we will always be able to line up on the roof of Cuddledown and gaze at the sea. This island is ours. Here, in some way, we are young forever.\"This book was unique. The quality of the writing, the expressiveness and the atmosphere of the whole thing just drew me in. Every single time.Another thing I loved was how different the characters were. The whole book is from Cady's first-person narrative, and as you can tell, that narrative is very individual only to Cadence. The writing style and the prose would have been completely different if it had been from any of the other characters' perspectives. Imagine if Gat or Johnny or Mirren had narrated this.It wouldn't have been the same.\"We are liars. We are beautiful and privileged. We are cracked and broken.\"I would absolutely recommend this book. It stole my heart and then ripped it to pieces. The prose and lyrical tone drew me in and then broke me. Three words I would use to describe it:enchanting,emotional, andexquisite."

Now that I'm done, I literally want to pick it up and start it all over again.I know alot of people dislike the disjointed writing, but it didn't bother me in the least. I flew through this book today despite being extremely busy at work, and I came home and immediately picked it back up. I just finished it after taking far too long of a bath and becoming raisin-y just because I couldn't bear to put the book down. I finished and got out of the bath (which had doubled in water volume due to tears) and IMMEDIATELY came to write my review. Still a little weepy.But seriously, GO READ THIS. Stop what you're doing and go get it RIGHT NOW. It will blow you away.As for me? I'm gonna go eat a bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and find something happy to read. I'll be ok, really."

        "user_review": "I don't even know what to say. This book was such a flippin' blast.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Okay, that's a little bit of a lie. I know the most important thing I have to say. First and foremost: I'M IN LOVE WITH HENRY TILNEY.SO FUNNY, smart, handsome, owns a cute house, and dare I say...surprisingly non bigoted?! He's the best. But let me backtrack a bit.Northanger Abbey is Austen's satire, and she pokes fun at gothic horror books by having her heroine, Catherine, believe she's essentially in one. AND SO MUCH GOOD COMES OUT OF THIS. The satire is hilarious - there's one moment, for example, when what Catherine believes is a ~spooky, ghastly scroll~ is really a list of the contents of a linen closet.But right when it's about to stop being funny, and you're getting just the teensiest bit annoyed at Catherine's naïveté, it ends! She confesses to Henry, whose father she believes is a murderer, and he gently shoots her down while still being all, \"I love you, girl.\" It's really great. AUSTEN IS A TALENT.That's the wonderful bit about this satire, IMO. I don't alwayssss love literary satire, because it gives me secondhand-embarrassment cringes. But this is satire within another narrative - a more typical Austen storyline. So it's funny and biting, while also being cute and happy and having adorable characters and a lovely ending! Talk about a TOTAL win-win, amiright?There are also even MORE plus sides to this. Austen makes a lot of sweeping generalizations about \"heroines\" and plots and books, and they are all hysterically funny and insanely accurate. She also writes a few amazing defenses of fiction - isn't that wild? While we're out here with people trying to make others feel bad for liking YA, our brethren in Austen's lifetime couldn't even readnovelswithout judgment. Call me crazy, but I'd rather someone insult my intellect for having read Sarah J. Maas than have to read 19th century TEXTBOOKS in order to be considered ~marriage material~. Bleh. Total nightmare, no? Let's count our blessings and chill the hell out for one freaking second.But I digress. Let's talk more about those characterssss. They are, in turn, perfectly hate-able and lovable. Hang on. I'll explain.When people are all, \"She's a villain I love to hate!\" I seriously never understand. I don't ever love hating characters. It makes reading unpleasant, usually, even villains. Like Levana from The Lunar Chronicles, or whatever. I just hated her. I didn't enjoy hating her. She got on my nerves and I was displeased whenever she showed up.But...Isabella and her brother in this book? Pretty hilarious. They're super annoying - Isabella uses people, is self-obsessed, and lies all the time; her brother is a total self-serving asshole. But when sweet lil Catherine is utterly ignorant to their flaws? It's really funny. The way Isabella's dialogue is written in particular made me laugh a lot, genuinely. Do people actually laugh out loud while reading on the reg?But also there are characters who are so intensely lovable! (Especially my husband.) Catherine, for one thing. She could be a little irritating, because she's SO immature sometimes, but she's just, like, a good person to her core who is so kind to those around her. You can't hate her. At least I couldn't, and I hate most characters.But let's talk more about bae. You can't see me, but I actually just turned into a heart eyes emoji from the neck up. Henry Tilney is a charmer from the SECOND he shows up. The banter he has with Catherine...unreal. Austen outdoes herself. Now I wanna reread their meeting scene. Ugh.And ultimately, this is just a bananas well-written book. A real masterpiece. Some of Austen's most famous quotes are from this book, and it totally makes sense why. Here are a couple fresh examples:\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.\"\"There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.\"See what I mean? I just read this book and I already wanna pick it up again.Bottom line: Charming characters, hilarity, biting satire, gorgeous quotes...It's Austen at her best. But when isn't she at her best?"

        "user_review": "I have a confession to make.Secretly, I much prefer \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Mansfield Park\" to anything else written by Jane Austen, even \"Pride and Prejudice,\" which we're all supposed to claim as our favorite because it is one of the Greatest Books Ever Written In the English Language. I don't DISLIKE \"Pride and Prejudice,\" but I just don't think it stands up to this one. I'm sorry, but it's true.\"Northanger Abbey\" feels like two very different stories that eventually merge into one at the end: the story of feisty, level-headed romance-novel-addict Catherine Morland and her adventures in Bath during the party season, falling in love and making new friends and escaping unpleasant suitors; and the story of Catherine's post-Bath vacation with her new best friend Eleanor back to Eleanor's country home, a huge creepy old place called Northanger Abbey. Catherine's obsession with bloodthirsty Gothic novels leads her to see a mystery or a creepy secret in every room (eventually leading her to suspect Eleanor's grumpy dad of having unceremoniously murdered his own wife, OR, possibly, of locking her up in a hidden dungeon somewhere inside the abbey), and her various misadventures and misunderstandings make for top-shelf farce. But then when a REAL mystery arrives on her doorstep (taking us back into the world of Bath and bringing the two stories together), she realizes that she's been looking at things upside-down and backwards the whole time.This book has some real,heartfelt drama and romance, but mainly I like it because it's really, really funny. Catherine is awesome and kind of nuts, and the supporting characters run the gamut from really likeable and charming (Eleanor and her brother Henry) to the excruciatingly irritating John and Isabella, who totally beat out both Mrs. Bennet, Aunt Norris, and Lucy Steele in my list of Best-Ever Annoying Jane Austen Characters."

        "user_review": "Jane Austen's novels are just about romance and naïve women. There just another telling of boy meets girl in an uninspiring way with a few social issues thrown in. Well, ashamed as I am to admit it, that is what I used to believe in my woefully idiotic ignorance. How foolish of me. Now that I've actually bothered to read one of her novels, because I had to for university purposes, I realise how stupid I was to actually think this. Jane Austen is one of, if not the, best novelists of all time. If you disbelieve me, and held a similar opinion to my own, then read one of her novels and find out for yourself.That being said though Catherine, the protagonist of this novel, is somewhat ignorant and naïve to the ways of the world; but, she had to be. Indeed, if not Austen would have been unable to achieve such an endearing comment on the absurdity of society, the role of women in that said society, and the ignorance toward the unpopular literary craft of the novel. How else if not though the eyes of an innocent young girl who cannot understand the mechanisms of these aspects of the world? Who when thrust into the pump room (a sort of ball room for dance and socialising) has virtually no idea how to behave.Catherine has an immeasurable misunderstanding of the intentions of others, and a misguided view that the world is like one of her beloved books: a romantic adventure with a little bit of popular gothic thrown in for excitement. She cannot comprehend the reasoning behind her friend, Isabella Thorpe's, behaviour and how she is only leading her brother along; she cannot understand that Henry's father is not a gothic villain, but a man in mourning with a harsh temper: her vision has become obscured.\"Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally sprang from these words. Could it be possible? - Could Henry's father? - And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest suspicions!\"This is achieved through a narration that is a work of genius. Austen has satirised the conventions of gothic literature by writing a semi-gothic novel herself that is focalised through the experience of Catherine. Catherine is well read, but only as far as the gothic genre allows. This has clouded her interpretation of the events that occur around her, consequently, life to her has become akin to the works by authors such as Radcliffe.This means that by the time that Catherine arrives at the abbey she expects it to be this place of utter darkness and dread; she expects to be a gothic castle and the home to a tyrannical gothic villain. However, when the veil is lifted and she realises that her life is in fact not a book and the motivations of the people in it are not what she thought them to be, the revelation of how foolish she has been dawns upon her. I'm not going to lie, I felt like Catherine at this point; I held a ridiculous opinion that when lifted allowed me to see the work of Austen for what it was: utter brilliance.I love Northanger Abbey; it is brilliant. Jane Austen is the master of her craft; her work is what she argued the novel to be:\"Only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language.\""

        "user_review": "A creepy mansion ...Dark and stormy nights ...... and Jane Austen just having fun with us.\"Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.\"Seventeen year old Catherine Morland, as innocent and naïve a heroine as Austen ever created, with no particular distinguishing characteristics except goodhearted sincerity and an overfondness for Gothic novels, is invited to stay in Bath for several weeks with kindly and wealthy neighbors. She meets a new bestie, Isabella ...... as well as Henry Tilney, a guy who's far too quick―not to mention wealthy―for her. But he has a weakness for cute girls who totally admire him.Their relationship strikes me as weak, probably because Austen was focused more on creating a parody by turning Gothic conventions on their heads than on creating a compelling heroine and romance. Henry is a great character, but Catherine really isn't quite up to his level, despite all of Jane Austen's rationalizations (though maybe that's true to life sometimes). However, I comfort myself with the thought that Catherine isn't unintelligent, just young and inexperienced. I have faith in Henry's ability to kindly help her learn to think more deeply and critically.Austen inserts a lot of sarcastic side comments mocking Gothic plot elements, like Catherine's father being \"not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters\" and her mother \"instead of dying in bringing the latter [sons] into the world, as anybody might expect,\" still living on in inexplicably good health. But Austen also takes the time, whilst skewering Gothic novels, to make a few pleas to readers in favor of novels generally. And she creates one of her most deliciously shallow and hypocritical characters in Isabella, whose mendacious comments, along with Henry's sarcastic ones, were the biggest pleasure in this book for me.When Catherine is invited to visit with Henry's family at the formidable Northanger Abbey, all her Gothic daydreams finally seem poised to come true. A mysterious heavy chest in her bedroom, with silver handles \"broken perhaps prematurely by some strange violence\"; an odd locked area of the house; a man she suspects of doing away with his wife. Gasp! Austen makes fun of it all, and Catherine's \"disturbed imagination\" along with it. Catherine repeatedly gets shot down and then makes firm although not necessarily long-lasting resolutions not to let her imagination run away with her in the future. But it seems likely that, in the end, she's gained some experience and wisdom.Not to mentionHenry.Good fun! The 2007 BBC TV movie with Felicity Jones and JJ Feild takes a few liberties with the book's plot, but I still recommend it highly.Random trivia:Watership Downuses the ending lines fromNorthanger Abbeyas one of its final chapter heading quotes, in what is probably my favorite use ever of a literary quote in an entirely different yet completely fitting context."

But Catherine? Well, she's somewhere in the middle of normal. She's not always as clever as she wishes, she's not the wealthiest heiress in the room, and she's not always sure of what she's doing. She's just...every girl who's ever gone to the big city and gotten a little dazzled by the wrong friends, overwhelmed by their imagination, and fallen in love with a handsome boy with a good sense of humor.Also, she loves a good gothic novel.Catherine seemed kind of silly and ignorant at first glance, but as the book goes on you realize that it's just that she'syoungand trusting. As the story progresses, you see her slowly come into herself, find her voice, and learn how to stand up to the characters that would lead her to do the wrong thing.And then there'sNorthanger Abby.Which, all things considered, wasn'tall thatinteresting. There were a few funny moments when she first arrived and tried her hand at becoming a gothic heroine, but I hoped there would be more to it than that. <--lotta buildup, not a lotta payoff!And Henry? He's the male version of Catherine. He's not some dashing Superman, he's just a nice normal guy who does the right thing.I was maybe happier for these two lovebirds when they beat the odds than I am for a lot of literary couplesbecausethey were just so damnregular.I read this 10 years ago and decided to listen to it on audiobook this time around. Loved it!Wanda McCaddonwas the narrator and she was absolutely wonderful."

        "user_review": "\"The person, be it gentlemen or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.\"This is my third Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility being the first two, and when I reviewed the first two, I felt that I did not do justice to the author, mainly because I thought myself not nearly qualified to review them. And now that I'm finished with Northanger Abbey, I have to confess, I still cannot shake that feeling off. But still, when one enjoys a book - a lot, it's hard not to say something - though that something might not measure up to the standards of the author's typical audience.\"To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of administering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would always wish to avoid.\"Being a little familiar with two of Austen's novels prior to this, I did expect Northanger Abbey to share some similarities - in the the style of writing, protagonist's way of seeing the world and how the reader is allowed to empathize in quite an interesting way - and they were there. However, to me, Northanger Abbey seemed like a comedy for the majority of the book. True, the beginning and the ending chapters did not share this, but still, most middle chapters appeared to be written with the chief aim of making the reader laugh, more than anything. And in my case, it did so quite well.\"man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown.\"Again, I don't believe I'm qualified enough to comment on Austen's writing skills, but cannot help mentioning how beautifully narrated everything is. It's the same exulting feeling I got while reading Pride and Prejudice, and, though Northanger Abbey might not be as well written or detailed as the former, I loved it almost the same. I'm gonna let this one be kind of a incomplete review, and one I'm someday going to re try (and hoping I'd be somewhat better by that time to better appreciate everything). But for now, I'll be content in saying I like this one better than Sense and Sensibility, but not quite as much as Pride and Prejudice.\"To be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful.\""

That's a bit annoying, as I can't compete with her wit of course. But even more annoying is the fact that I wrote my own imaginary review in my head before I started the book - and as opposed to Austen's summary, mine doesn't work out at all anymore, now that I know the story. It is dangerous to check the facts before writing your opinion - for facts have the frustrating habit of changing your opinions - if you dare to leave the realm of your fiction.Like the young heroine in Northanger Abbey, I seemed to have lost grip of fiction and reality recently - due to an overly greedy consumption of novels!Like the young heroine, I thought I knew what to expect of characters, setting and plot before I had even ventured out to explore them, and like her, I created a massive amount of tension for myself, only to find myself in the somewhat silly situation of waking up to a reality that did not at all justify my preconceived ideas.Let's say I prided myself in \"knowing\" what to expect of Jane Austen. Let's say I started full of prejudices. Let's say that I had to force myself to come to my senses after a roller coaster that tested my sensibility more than I am willing to admit. Let's say I thought I had a perfect review in the making, following the idea of explaining the exaggerated characters and dramatic actions with regard to Austen's time, place and gender. I was going to put Northanger Abbey in its place - liking it for its classic status, but dismissing it (secretly) as irrelevant in the modern context. I was going to compare it to earlier works of Gothic fiction, and maybe even to my timeless favourite Dickens and his comically evil villains and puritan heroes.But no. It won't do.She's a bloody genius, - Jane Austen (if one can still say that nowadays without involuntarily insulting her intelligence and judgment)!Exaggerated characters? The Thorpes too vain, greedy, shallow and stupid? Eh - show me the person in high society today that is NOT equally vulgar, volatile and obvious!Ridiculous naivety of the heroine? Eh - we have people organising Flat Earth Conferences (and it isn't even fiction or satire, but plain truth).Old-fashioned family structures? Eh - if the eternal generation conflict was solved in the meantime, I must have missed it! Can you send me the action plan, please?So, if there is anything \"dated\" in Jane Austen, it must be the lovable character of her protagonist, her passionate argument for reading (novels), and her linguistically convincing prose. Well, for those minor defects I am willing to forgive her, in the name of classic literature.She's proof that literature can always transcend the narrow boundaries of its time and place. It can speak to readers all over the world, in the most various life circumstances - as long as the message is honest and rings true.Loved it. Despite all my pride and prejudice, with all my sense and sensibility."

        "user_review": "Northanger Abbey, Jane AustenNorthanger Abbey was the first of Jane Austen's novels, to be completed for publication, in 1803. However, it was not published until after her death in 1817, along with another novel of hers, Persuasion.Northanger Abbey is a satire of Gothic novels, which were quite popular at the time, in 1798–99. This coming-of-age story revolves around Catherine Morland, a young and naïve \"heroine,\" who entertains the reader on her journey to a better understanding of the world and those around her.In the course of the novel, she discovers that she differs from those other women who crave wealth or social acceptance, as instead she wishes only to have happiness supported by genuine morality.Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman. Although a tomboy in her childhood, by the age of 17 she is\"in training for a heroine\"and is excessively fond of reading Gothic novels, among which Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho is a favourite.Catherine is invited by the Allens, her wealthier neighbours in Fullerton, to accompany them to visit the town of Bath and partake in the winter season of balls, theatre and other social delights. She is soon introduced to a clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, with whom she dances and converses.Through Mrs. Allen's old school friend Mrs. Thorpe, she meets her daughter Isabella, a vivacious and flirtatious young woman, and the two quickly become friends. Mrs. Thorpe's son John is also a friend of Catherine's older brother, James, at Oxford where they are both students.The Thorpes are not happy about Catherine's friendship with the Tilneys, as they correctly perceive Henry as a rival for Catherine's affections, though Catherine is not at all interested in the crude John Thorpe.Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the Thorpes and the Tilneys, though John Thorpe continuously tries to sabotage her relationship with the Tilneys. This leads to several misunderstandings, which put Catherine in the awkward position of having to explain herself to the Tilneys. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «ک‍ات‍ری‍ن‌ (ک‍ل‍ی‍س‍ای‌ ن‍ورت‌ ه‍ن‍گ‍ر)»؛ «صومعه شمالی»؛ «صومعه ن‍ورت‌ ه‍ن‍گ‍ر»؛ «نورثنگر ابی»؛ نویسنده: جین آستین؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه دسامبر سال1985میلادیعنوان: ک‍ات‍ری‍ن‌ (ک‍ل‍ی‍س‍ای‌ ن‍ورت‌ ه‍ن‍گ‍ر)؛ اثر: جین آستین؛ مترجم: منوچهر آرام؛ تهران؛ کوشش، سال1363، در348ص؛ چاپ دیگر با عنوان کاترین: تهران، پر، سال1372؛ در288ص؛ چاپ سوم زمستان سال1372؛ چاپ دیگر سال1388 در320ص؛ شابک9789648007466؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 19معنوان: صومعه ن‍ورت‌ ه‍ن‍گ‍ر؛ اثر: جین آستین؛ مترجم: فریده دامغانی؛ تهران؛ تیر، سال1379، در280ص؛ شابک9646581498؛عنوان: صومعه شمالی؛ اثر: جین آستین؛ مترجم: وحید منوچهری واحد؛ تهران؛ جامی، سال1389، در255ص؛ چاپ دوم سال1392؛ شابک9786001760181؛عنوان: نورثنگر ابی؛ اثر: جین آستین؛ مترجم: رضا رضایی؛ تهران؛ نشر نی، سال1387، در280ص؛ شابک9789643129934؛ چاپ دوم سال1388؛ چاپ چهارم سال1392؛نخستین اثر «جین آستین» است؛ ایشان، این کتاب را در سال1803میلادی، به یک کتابفروشی، به نام «کرازبی و شرکا»، به مبلغ ده پوند فروختند؛ اما «کرازبی و شرکا»، کتاب را منتشر نکردند؛ در سال1816میلادی، ناشر، همان کتاب را، به همان مبلغ، به برادر «جین آستین» برگرداند؛ کتاب، پس از درگذشت نویسنده، در روزهای پایانی ماه دسامبر سال1817میلادی، منتشر، و در عنوانش، سال1818میلادی نگاشته شدآغاز داستان، از برگردان جناب آقای «منوچهر آرام»: (از مشاهده ی «کاترین مورلند»، هیچکس گمان نمیبرد، که خصوصیات یک زن قهرمان را، با خود همرا�� داشته باشد؛ موقعیت او در زندگی، شخصیت پدر و مادر، ویژگیهای فردی، و تمایلات باطنی اش، تماما تضادی را، با ظاهر او آشکار میساختند؛ پدر او، وابسته به کلیسا، سرشناس، و نسبتا متمول، و مرد محترمی به شمار میرفته، گرچه چندان جذابیتی در او، مشاهده نمیگردید؛ ولی در عین حال، با نام «ریچارد»، مورد توجه همگان قرار داشت؛ او با برخورداری از دو سرچشمه ی امرار معاش زندگی، از استقلال کافی برخوردار بود، و دست کم عادت نداشت، که محدودیتی در برابر دخترهای خود، ایجاد نماید؛ مادر «کاترین»، زنی سرشار از احساسات درونی، خوش اخلاق، و برخوردار از دیگر صفات نیکو، در کمال صحت، و تندرستی بود، و پیش از آنکه «کاترین» متولد شود، سه پسر به دنیا آورده بود…؛)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 29/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

She reads too much, an illness that is sadly terminal, Gothic books are her passion and the rage of the era . Any ancient home that is eerie , ominous or sinister the young lady would enjoy seeing, if there were any in the area. She lives in a quiet English village, (too quiet) where everyone knows each other, which keeps the populous from misadventures. Her parents have ten children and surprisingly, her mother is alive and healthy. Miss Morland's father is a well to do clergyman, but with all those kids, nobody would know especially Catherine. Mrs. Allen a wealthy neighbor is going on a six -week vacation to Bath, with Mr.Allen ( he has the fashionable gout ), the most famous resort in England. Mrs. Allen needs an agreeable companion to talk to, she's rather silly, asks Catherine. Her chief interest is clothes, still how long can you speak about fashion, before it gets tiresome? The fatigued husband doesn't stay in her presence very long. Arriving in town is exciting and daunting, soon people start to notice Miss Catherine Morland particularly young men, a new experience for her. She grew up a tomboy playing outside with the boys, not inside with dolls. Yet the last three years her homely awkwardness has vanished, a pleasant, pretty appearance she acquires that even her astonished mother, acknowledges. Catherine soon forms a friendship with Isabella Thorpe a beautiful, deceitful, gold digger, her family has little, but she has ... at 21, time is running out for her to catch a rich husband. It doesn't take long to discover that Catherine's brother James, and Isabella's brother John, are best friends, so naturally the two ladies also become too. Then the brothers of the girls come to town, unexpectedly. Catherine loves her plain looking older brother, and you can imagine the shock that she feels, when James and Isabella become engaged! Yes, it's the first time Catherine has been out of her insulated village, of Fullerton. Still true love has a rocky road to travel, when it isn't. Henry Tilney a wealthy man's son, meets the charming Catherine at a dance. She has eyes for him, but so does Isabella's annoying brother John, for her (he's always talking about his horses). However Henry's older brother Captain Frederick Tilney, arrives too, very popular Bath is for romance and starts flirting with Isabella, which she doesn't mind but James does. He has more money than Catherine's brother. The resort is famous for the miraculous waters, though most go there for the dancing, plays, card games and walking around in the Grand Pump Room and meeting the rich... Showing everyone who's interested they're in town, nobody is... Later Catherine is invited by General Tilney the father of Henry, to go to Northanger Abbey, his home. Amazingly a real Gothic house with his son, and daughter Eleanor, another friend of Catherine 's and stay a few weeks. The girl with a wild imagination is thrilled, finally, all Catherine's dreams have come to pass ..."

        "user_review": "Northanger Abbeyis the shortest of Jane Austen's six major novels, and has a special place in many readers' hearts. In many ways it is not the tightly constructed witty sort of story we expect from this author, yet its spontaneity and rough edges prove to be part of its charm. Started when she was very young, it should perhaps more properly be classed as part of her juvenilia. What lifts it above the other earlier works, however, is the skill she demonstrates for writing a parody of all the gothic romantic novels which were so popular at the time. And this aspect is twinned with another of Jane Austen's concerns, a satirical observation of human nature within a narrow band of society; a comedy of manners.There are many literary allusions, which focus on the gothic genre. At the time Jane Austen was writing, novels - especially gothic novels of this type - were looked down upon by many people, particularly those of the upper classes. It is likely that a young writer would therefore feel that she needed a strong position from which to defend her craft against any critics who might in future disparage her work. The characters inNorthanger Abbeyitself constantly refer both to\"Mrs Radcliffe\", and her novels, such as\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\"and\"The Italian\"by name. At one point, where Catherine, the heroine, is chatting to her friend, she asks Isabella for suggestions. Her friend replies,\"I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocket-book. \"Castle of Wolfenbach\", \"Clermont\", \"Mysterious Warnings\", \"Necromancer of the Black Forest\", \"Midnight Bell\", \"Orphan of the Rhine\", and \"Horrid Mysteries\". Those will last us some time.\"And Catherine insists,\"Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all horrid?\"As an interesting aside, although for many years these were assumed to be merely invented titles by Jane Austen, it has since come to light that they are actual gothic novels, by different authors. They have subsequently been republished as\"The Northanger Horrid Novels Collection\".This particular sort of comedy is lacking in Jane Austen's subsequent novels, which perhaps are a little more cautious in their wit and irony, being intended for a wider audience.Northanger Abbeywas meant mainly as family entertainment, which is why Austen mischievously includes so many literary references, which she expected her relatives to pick up and recognise. Jane Austen also addresses the reader directly throughout the novel, and sometimes voices her own opinions quite forcefully, forgetting the story for a moment. But perhaps she had an eye to the future, considering that attack is the best form of defence, and writing this way quite deliberately in anticipation of any critical assessment. As these passages burst upon us, we are provided with a little insight into Austen's opinions at the time. Famously, very little remains extant, to show us her opinions, due to her instructions to her sister Cassandra to burn all her letters after her death.OriginallyNorthanger Abbeywas entitled\"Susan\"and written around 1798-99. It was the first of her novels to be submitted for publication, in 1803. However, it was not in fact published until 1817-18, after further revision by the author, including changing the main character's name from\"Susan\"to\"Catherine\". Jane Austen died in July 1817. The two novelsNorthanger Abbeyand\"Persuasion\"(her final novel) were thus both published posthumously, comprising the first two volumes of a four-volume set. Interestingly, neither title was her own invention, but probably that of her brother, Henry, who had been instrumental in their publication.As well as being a Gothic parody, and a comedy of manners,Northanger Abbeyis a coming of age novel, another favourite theme from Jane Austen. The first sentence,\"No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine\"sets the very droll, tongue in cheek tone for the writing. We are chattily introduced to the young and naïve Catherine, the novel's unlikely heroine. Catherine is not particularly pretty or feminine, and one of ten children of a country clergyman. However, by the age of 17, we are told that she is\"in training for a heroine\", having all the attributes considered desirable in a young girl at the time. The reader enjoys Catherine's youthful enthusiasm and also how impressionable she is. She has crazes, such as being excessively fond of reading Gothic novels - the more\"horrid\"she claims with glee, the better. She takes everything at face value, at the start of the novel being unable to see any deviousness, or any baser motives. Catherine is not very perceptive, not ever able to interpret what may lie behind certain actions if it is negative. She is innocent - a naïve - and in this, has a lot of charm and attraction for the reader.We follow Catherine's progress, as she is invited by some wealthier neighbours in Fullerton, the Allens, to accompany them to visit the fashionable town of Bath. There she is introduced to society over the winter season, through attending balls and the theatre. So although it is constantly referred to, there is in fact little gothic feel in the whole first half of the novel. It is much more similar to Jane Austen's later novels, both in its setting, and its preoccupations. It is concerned with young people and their feelings; how they mature, and how their marriage prospects improve as a consequence. In this aspect, all Jane Austen's novels are very similar, and all of them have reassuringly happy endings. Jane Austen is always keen to entertain her readers!Catherine's amiability and good character is further demonstrated through her making friends, in Bath, with a confident older girl, Isabella Thorpe, the daughter of Mrs Allen's old school-friend. The reader can see straightaway that Isabella is far more savvy and ambitious than Catherine, and possibly manipulating her new friend. Isabella has a brother, John whom Catherine is delighted to find is also a friend of her older brother, James. Both young men are fellow students at Oxford University. However she (and the reader) takes an instant dislike to John, finding him pompous, brash, boastful and overbearing. In the meantime she has met a witty and clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, and enjoyed his company and conversation. The reader can deduce that, at 17, she is well on the way to falling in love with this intelligent and polite, slightly older and more experienced gentleman.The novel has several social situations which, although very much of their time, reveal essential aspects of human nature which are timeless. The difficulties facing Catherine are difficulties and situations common to all teenagers. There is embarrassment, a feeling of gaucheness and several occasions where the peer pressure is very strong, such as when James, Isabella and John try to persuade her to join them when she had made a former promise for another engagement. Catherine also has to learn how to stay polite and resolute when she is bullied by John Thorpe. And when she eventually returns home to her parents, uncomprehending of why she has been treated in such a shameful way, the reader is treated to the common enough spectacle of a moody, sulky teenager.For the second half of the novel the setting has switched to Northanger Abbey itself, as Catherine has received an invitation to stay there. The tone becomes slightly darker, and the viewpoint switches to be almost entirely from Catherine's perspective, using free indirect narration. Everything is presented from Catherine's point of view, which leads to some hilarious moments, due to her romantic notions of what an ancient abbey should be like. The reader has been well prepared for this, through conversations between Catherine and Henry Tilney. Here she is very excited about the prospect of a visit to the abbey,\"You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey.\"\"To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what one reads about?\"Henry Tilney continues to tease her, although Catherine revels in the descriptions, not realising that this is what he is doing,\"And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as \"what one reads about\" may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry? ... \"Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber - too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size - its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?\"Catherine waits impatiently for her visit, whereas the reader has been privy to broad hints that the abbey may not be at all as she expects. Sure enough, our innocent heroine's expectations increase on the journey,\"As they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight of the abbey ... returned in full force, and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows.\"But as the reader expects, the exterior of the building comes as a bit of a let-down,\"She knew not that she had any right to be surprised, but there was a something in this mode of approach which she certainly had not expected. To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along a smooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity of any kind, struck her as odd and inconsistent ...The windows, to which she looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were yet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch was preserved - the form of them was Gothic - they might be even casements - but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was very distressing.\"All the descriptions of Bath society, both inNorthanger Abbeyand Austen's other novels, are drawn from her own experience. One of the interesting aspects ofNorthanger Abbey, however, is that passages such as these seem to indicate she incorporates her reading experience as well as her real-life experience; it is just as much a product of the Gothic novels that she herself read. One of the highlights of the novel is where Henry Tilney teases Catherine about the\"horrid\"contents of such novels. Typically there would be a crumbling old building, possibly an abbey, once used to house nuns or monks. The abbey would then become abandoned and derelict, and later bought by an evil lord or baron. Dastardly deeds would occur in the ancient edifice, once the lord or baron took possession, and the once holy nature of the abbey would become an ironic feature in these Gothic novels.Northanger Abbey is a dreadful disappointment for Catherine, who had imagined herself as the heroine of a Gothic novel. Living out her imaginative fantasies, she was hoping to be thrilled by mystery, horror, and sinister and macabre deeds from an earlier time. She had found Bath to be a pleasant tourist town, interesting for her to visit, but in Catherine's mind, the Abbey would inevitably be a place of new heightened experiences. At every point where the Abbey turns out to be conventional and normal, Catherine remembers the abbeys from her favourite gothic novels, deliberately frightening herself to complete her thrilling anticipations,\"The night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole afternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rained violently. Catherine, as she crossed the hall, listened to the tempest with sensations of awe; and, when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey.\"Catherine still longs for the abbey to conform to her imagined ideal, and one of the funniest scenes in the book iswhen she discovers a cabinet, with a mysterious paper inside. Her imagination runs riot at what this could be, but it eventually turns out to be simply a laundry list.At this point Catherine begins to see how ludicrous and immature her fantasies have been and begins to be rather ashamed of herself. Here is the start of this episode,\"she was struck by the appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before. Henry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet ...It was some time however before she could unfasten the door, the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her search; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and her feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her heart fluttered, her knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized, with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest.\"This parody is not only entertaining, as the reader enjoys the heightened drama, and the exaggerated language which would be a typical feature of the gothic novels of the day. We also hold in our minds the strong suspicion that what Catherine is to discover may be quite ordinary and unremarkable, and are eager for the heroine to be thwarted and become crestfallen - yet there is just a tiny possibility remaining in our minds that there is indeed something\"most horrid\". The skill of Jane Austen's narration lies in showing the gap between how things would be in the ideal life of a fictional heroine, and how things actually are in reality for the innocent naïve Catherine, and the consequent absurdity.Here is the culmination of the ironic humour in this episode, when Catherine is plunged into darkness,\"Catherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath. Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment. Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes.\"For Catherine fantasies are all; life is exciting, and people are seen as wholly good or wholly bad. She does not realise, as the reader does, that General Tilney is an outright snob, constantly anxiously comparing his home and gardens with those of Mr. Allen. These parts, and the depiction of General Tilney's character (which, oddly, is very similar to the character of Mr. Elliot, the father of the heroine Anne in Jane Austen's final novel,\"Persuasion\") is one of the most amusing parts to the reader. General Tilney is always so very pleased to find that his belongings are larger or more impressive than those of Mr. Allen. Of course, the justification for this, is that he wants his children to marry into rich and wealthy families. The people Jane Austen identifies with and writes about are a very narrow band of the gentry. Tradesmen, and anyone who works for a living, are to be looked down on. The aristocracy are often to be poked fun at. Jane Austen's heroes and heroines are frequently from good families, but have fallen on hard times. They are almost invariably impoverished gentlefolk.Catherine still seems very naïve in her behaviour, however. She has no idea of the love interests surrounding her, not seeming to noticethe romance which is developing between James and Isabella, and being equally puzzled when Isabella flirts with Frederick Tilney. Catherine does not pick up that Isabella, despite her protestations to the contrary, is dismayed on learning of James's limited future income. Catherine also has no idea why the General is so courteous and solicitous of her, merely believing him to be exceptionally kind. There is a conflict in her mind, as she also believes him capable of murdering his wife.It is only when she begins to perceive such thoughts as ridiculous, that Catherine begins to mature into a young woman.Northanger Abbeyis an enjoyable read even today, well over 200 years after it was written. The characters are recognisable types even now, as human nature does not change, only the mores of the society they are in. And there are some memorably entertaining minor characters in this novel. Some critics say that the hero, Henry Tilney, is too much of a bully, and behaves in a patronising way to Catherine. He frequently points out her mistakes and tries to mould her into thinking the way he does. It could be argued that this was very much a prevalent view of the time, although readers now may have a problem accepting such a relationship as something to be wished for.Yet even here, Jane Austen show that her ideas were more advanced than many of her contemporaries,\"The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already set forth by the capital pen of a sister author; and to her treatment of the subject I will only add, in justice to men, that though to the larger and more trifling part of the sex, imbecility in females is a great enhancement of their personal charms, there is a portion of them too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything more in woman than ignorance.\"So although the author accepts that such a disparity in a romantic relationship - or ultimately marriage - was to be expected, she does not praise stupidity in women. Jane Austen maintains that men do not look for stupidity in women, only ignorance, because some men enjoy instructing women. In this particular novel, the reader is led to assume that Henry enjoys Catherine's ignorance, her impressionable and youthful mind, because it gives him a chance to teach her. A modern reader will of course take exception to such a message; the idea that this is in any way to be desired. But a modern reader can also appreciate the subtle distinction between ignorance and stupidity - and also that Austen's eye for these matters is always both perceptive and deeply sarcastic. She writes with a waspish wit, about what she knows. Yes, it is a narrow band of society and culture, within a very specific time-frame, but she sometimes manages to dissociate herself from its constraints, and always excels in what she does."

        "user_review": "Northanger Abbeyis a charming story that revolves around a young, innocent, and naive \"heroine\" (to use Austen's word), Catherine Morland. True to Austen's famous quotation that\"If adventures will not befall a young Lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad\", the story progresses with Catherine taking an adventurous journey from her home in Fullerton to Bath and then to a Gothic Abbey in Gloucestershire. In her journey, she comes to understand the people and world around her, of what is important in life, and finally find true love and happiness.More than Austen's other books,Northanger Abbeycan be treated as Romance. The lightness, vibrancy, youthful exuberance, and elegance of the setting of Bath in the Regency period I believe brought foremost the romantic element in the story. And the prominence that is given to the sweet love story of Catherine and Henry Tilney is most charming. :)Marriage and money are always a key theme in Jane Austen's books. And it is here so too. The eagerness to make monetarily advantageous matches by the young men and women for themselves as well as by parents for their children is cleverly and satirically portrayed. The Regency society's consideration of money as the necessity for true happiness in marriage always met with the critical hand of Austen. And her critical social commentary on the matter is always fascinating to read.Apart from the popular key theme, there is also a Gothic element that touches the storyline in bringing up the Gothic Northanger Abbey - the residence of the Tilneys. The Gothic mysteries that were popular at the time, especially those written by Ann Radcliffe, create in the mind of our young heroine wild imaginations which lead to an uncomfortable confrontation with Henry Tilney. This episode made me reflect on whether Jane Austen was being satirical of the popular Gothic horror mysteries or being appreciative of them. In the manner the consequences of Catherine's imagination were portrayed, I was inclined to believe in the former.Austen's heroine, Catherine, and hero, Henry are yet another two unforgettable characters. With each Jane Austen book, I'm adding more loving characters to the list of my fictitious friends. :) I loved Catherine. Her innocent naivety combined with the steady righteous mind made her so adorable. Although I don't care about her Gothic horror fancies, I share a love for old castles and abbeys with her. :) Henry! The witty, sarcastic yet strong, steady, and affectionate Henry too is loveable. I enjoyed their story very much, especially the chapters of Catherine's pining after Henry which is so well written by Austen. However, their romance was initiated by the heroine, Catherine and this is a novel case. In Austen's words,\"his (Henry's) affection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought\"is what makes Henry attach himself to Catherine. Interesting!The rest of the characters were chosen from a lot of friendly, kind, vain, and villainous. Here, however, more than the good characters, my attention was grabbed by a couple of vain and the villainous introduced by Austen. General Tilney heads the way with his pride and cruelty followed closely by the Thorpe sister and brother with their greed. And captain Tilney closes the trail with his vain importance.The writing is light, spirited, and satirical. Being the first written work by Jane Austen, however, one can detect an amateurish touch. Also, this novel stands a little apart from her later, more successful works, with its Gothic elements and more romance. I liked the difference and enjoyed the satire, which is the common thread of all her novels. On the whole, it is a beautiful work in itself, for, after all, it is Jane Austen, who penned it, and nothing less can come out from her store."

        "user_review": "NOVELS.Let us leave it to the Reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us not desert one another, we are an injured body. Although our productions have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has been so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens,--there seems almost a general with of decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them. \"I am no novel reader--I seldom look into novels--Do not imagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel.'--Such is the common cant.--\"And what are you reading, Miss--?' \"Oh! it is only a novel!' replies the young lady; while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame.Gertrude SteinGertrude Stein: Do you know why you are here Mr. Keeten?Keeten: I don't even know where I am.Stein: You are before the Book Tribunal.I rubbed my jaw.Keeten: Did Hemingway have to slug me?Stein: Fetching, people such as yourself, to appear before this tribunal seems to be the one thing that Hemingway does enjoy about serving on the panel.Hemingway gave a short bark of a laugh.Ernest HemingwayStein: Let me introduce Charlotte Bronte and of course you've met Mr. Hemingway.I waved at Bronte. Hemingway gave me a salute. I gave him a tight nod and my jaw another rub.Stein: You have been assigned counsel. Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald.Keeten: Yes I would like to talk to him. Maybe he can explain what this is all about. Where is he?Stein: I do believe he is under your table.I leaned over and spied a slumped form softly snoring. I grabbed a shoulder and rolled him over. Gin fumes teared up my eyes.Keeten: Miss Stein I need a new counsellor.Stein: I'm afraid that is impossible. You've told many people that Fitzgerald is your favorite writer and the rules of this tribunal is that your favorite writer represents you.Keeten: I'd like to change that to Gore Vidal.Bouts of laughter greet this request. Only then did I realize that the seats behind me were full of dead writers. I waved to Kurt Vonnegut and he gave me a wink.Keeten: Was something I said humorous?Stein: In the short time that Mr. Vidal has joined us he has been requested many times, but unfortunately no one has been before us that actually considered him to be their favorite writer.Hemingway: You chose unwisely. Fitzgerald over me what a joke that is.Keeten: I think your work is swell Hemingway and Miss Bronte, I really loved Villette.Stein: Okay, okay Mr. Keeten enough with the flattering. What do you think of my work?Keeten: ErhhhHer mannish features framed a pronounced grimace.Stein: That's okay Mr. Keeten I won't force you to manufacture platitudes, very few people can really understand and appreciate my work.I thought a change of subject was in order.Keeten: Why exactly am I here?Stein: It is regarding Jane Austen.I felt my blood run a little cold.Keeten: I just finished readingNorthanger Abbey.Stein: Yes we know. In the past you have made some rather cutting remarks about Miss Austen.Keeten: I won't deny that I harbored some resentment, not towards Miss Austen as much as towards a survey class I was forced to take in college.Stein: You sir, are parsing words.Hemingway interrupted. Isn't it time for a drink?Stein: Why not?Djuna Barnes walked out with a silver tray filled with shots of gin and as the glass clinked on the table in front of me Fitzgerald sprang up like a jack in the box with his hand out, fingers none too steady, reaching for a glass. He slammed the shot down his throat and before I could tilt my own glass up he'd already slid back beneath the table.The gin hit my stomach like a mariachi band.As Barnes walked back by me after serving the judges, looked in the prime of life like all the judges, although that was up for debate with Stein, I said you are prettier than your pictures.Djuna BarnesBarnes: Save it. You are not even remotely my type.I could feel the heat on my neck climbing up to my cheeks. She flipped my chin with her finger.Barnes: Good luck anyway.Stein: If you are finished annoying Miss Barnes, Mr. Keeten, can we proceed?Keeten: Of course.Stein: As you were saying.Keeten: I apologize to Miss Austen if any of my remarks were inappropriately expressed. I can assure her that I have the utmost respect for her as a writer. In fact I intend to write a very positive review aboutNorthanger Abbey.Stein: The writer in question is not allowed to attend the proceedings, but we will express your regret for your behavior to her. We have a party that we must get to Mr. Keeten so we are going to wrap this up. It is our intention here today to give you a warning about expressing yourself in such flippant ways about the works of the members of this novelist community in the future. If we feel the need to call you back again I can assure you more strident discussion will be conveyed to you.Keeten: Yes ma'am.Stein: Anything further to add Miss Bronte.Bronte: I think he is kind of handsome.Charlotte BronteStein: Irrelevant Miss Bronte and to balance the scales I must say I find him to be a rather unattractive man. Mr. Hemingway?Hemingway: Do I get to send him back?Stein: *Sigh* yes Mr. Hemingway please do so.Hemingway walked across the room towards me. Before I could even speculate about how he was going to send me back his fist imploded against my jaw. As I slid to the floor I heard him say.\"I got to send you back the same way you came Tinkerbell.\"I woke on the floor of my library in a slurry of drool. My head pounding, both sides of my jaw tender to the touch. Note to self do not write a negative review of Hemingway. From the way my stomach feels I'd say the gin ate a hole through my insides and was still burrowing deeper. I pull myself up to the computer.The Lovely Jane AustenThe heroine of this novel, Miss Catherine Morland, was a reader of gothic literature. I know it was Jane Austen's intention to poke fun at the craze of people reading this type of novel, but since I'm a fan of the genre I actually enjoyed the frequent references to the author Ann Radcliffe and the other books that were being bought, enjoyed, and discussed in English drawing rooms of the time. Miss Morland has hopes of finding herself enmeshed in a romance of gothic proportions. When her parents consent to letting her visit friends and she meets new friends she knows she is on the verge of a grand adventure. She meets the Tilney's, and in particular meets the man of our tale, Henry Tilney, who demonstrates early on that he had the makings of being the romantic hero of the new plot evolving in the mind of Miss Morland. She is invited to visit the Tilney's at the family estate and the vision that Catherine composes in her mind about Northanger Abbey is doomed for disappointment. To give one example where the Abbey failed to provide the proper gothic atmosphere:The windows, to which she looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the General talk of his preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were yet less what her fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch was preserved--the form of them was Gothic--they might be even casements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest stone-work, for painted glass, dirt and cobwebs, the difference was very distressing.Catherine is mortified by her own ineptness with proper behavior. She is manipulated by friends, but proves to be a quick learner and shows a steely spine standing up to their overbearing behavior towards her. When she is cast out she proves her mettle once again finding her own way home with quiet determination despite her inexperience with the workings of the world. Yes she is silly, and maybe because of her Gothic view of the world, I liked Catherine...a lot. I wish the plot of the novel would have allowed more of Henry Tilney as he certainly seemed like a man, a reader of novels, who I would have enjoyed taking a long walk with to discuss literature, life, and all things nice. There is subtle comedy throughout this short novel and even when our heroine is unhappy I didn't feel distressed, for how could the world deny Catherine her happy ending? If you have struggled with other Austen novels I can assure you this is a breezy affair, not to say that it doesn't have literary merit, for it has, if nothing else, repaired my relationship with Miss Austen and I fully intend now to reread her other works and evaluate them through attitude adjusted eyes."

        "user_review": "(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)The CCLaP 100:In which I read for the first time a hundred so-called \"classics,\" then write reports on whether or not they deserve the label.Book #24:Northanger Abbey, by Jane Austen (1818)The story in a nutshell:Although not published until after her death in 1818 (but more on that in a bit),Northanger Abbeywas actually the first book written by infamous \"chick-lit forerunner\" Jane Austen, with most scholars agreeing that she originally penned it in 1798 when barely out of her teens; so it makes sense, then, that the novel centers around the 17-year-old Catherine Morland, and of all the issues important to a typical late teen. A delightful yet melodramatic young woman, Catherine has a way of naturally charming almost everyone she meets, even while being a hopeless devotee of trashy \"gothic novels\" (think beach-read for the Georgian Era), and of letting them unduly influence her already fanciful and curious mind. When middle-aged friends of the Morlands, then, invite the sheltered rural-living Catherine to join them for six weeks in the cosmopolitan resort town of Bath, she can't help but to be thrilled; and indeed, the bulk of this novel's prose is devoted to capturing the ins-and-outs of youth culture in such a period, the subtle and ultra-complicated flirtation rituals that took place each evening among such communal settings as recital halls and the boardwalk.Things get even more interesting, though, when one of the friends she makes in Bath invites Catherine to continue her holiday by joining her family at their country home, an old Medieval religious fortress called Northanger Abbey that they've converted into a contemporary living space, with Catherine's goth-filled head going nuts over visions of crumbling cobwebby back hallways and dark family secrets. But alas, the abbey turns out to be quite modern and well-maintained, and all of Catherine's attempts to dream up spooky conspiracy theories are met with perfectly blasé rational explanations; that forces her instead to have to pay attention to the messy romantic entanglements going on between her friends, as well as the constant wooing by her own various would-be suitors that she is constantly trying to brush off. Add a mysterious Napoleonic ship captain, some misunderstandings over money, a couple of messy public breakups; and by the end, we leave our hero a little wiser about the world if not a little more jaded, understanding now as a young adult that it's the consistent behavior of a person through good times and bad that determines their character, not their endowment or war record or any other surface-level statistic you can mention.The argument for it being a classic:Fans ofNorthanger Abbeyargue that it is Austen distilled into its most essential form -- laser-precise observations about the human condition and the fallacies of so-called \"civilized society,\" but without the obsessive preoccupation over landing a man that marks so much of her later and more well-known work. And that's important, they say, because we should actually be celebrating Austen for the perceptive insights into the human psyche she was capable of, not for the bonnet-wearing eyelash-fluttering romantic elements that seem to so dominate any discussion about her anymore. The reason Austen continues to be so popular, they argue, is precisely because her stories are so timeless at their core; although ostensibly dealing with the fussy aristocratic issues of the day, in reality they say things about the way young women see the world that are still exactly and utterly true of young women 200 years later. It's easy to lose sight of this within the epic frippery of such later masterpieces asPride & PrejudiceandSense & Sensibility, fans argue;Northanger Abbeycuts through all this filler, leaving a slim and artistically muscular volume that ironically stands the test of time much better than her bigger projects.The argument against:Of course, let's not forget that there's a reason Austen's later work is so much better known and loved, say this book's critics -- and that's because those books are simply better, according to any criteria you wish to name, the result of an older and wiser woman with not only better writing skills but a much more complex outlook on the world. Although there's not much debate anymore over whether this is a historically important and well-done story, many critics argue thatNorthanger Abbeysimply doesn't rise to the level of \"classic,\" as is the similar case with so many other first novels by authors who eventually become famous.My verdict:Okay, I admit it; after years of making fun of people for their obsessive Austen fandom, now that I've finally read my first novel of hers myself, I have to confess that I'mawfully impressed, and can easily see why people still go so crazy for her work in the first place. Because I gotta tell you, it's positively freaky how much like a modern 17-year-old girl in the early 2000s that Catherine actually sounds like here, of just how many of the details Austen chose to focus on turn out to be universal observations about teenage female personas in general, and not simply observations about that particular age's popular culture and societal norms. I love, for example, how Catherine simply accepts in this quiet way the realization of how much more important it is in the eyes of men to appear smart in public than in the eyes of women; how gold-digging for a husband is simply wrong no matter what the circumstances; that you understand a lot more about a person when observing them in a bad mood than a good one. I love that Catherine automatically assumes the craziest explanation for any situations that occur in her life, because she's a bored teen and this is what bored teens do to entertain themselves. I love how she is constantly worrying about saying the wrong thing in front of others; how she is constantly running off in embarrassment over various impolitic confessions blurted out during enjoyable conversations; how the people older than her accept all this from her with a charmed sense of bemusement, while her fellow teenage girls react with catty bitchiness. I love how their entire social circles revolve around these tiny, barely perceptible actions, stuff completely inconsequential to grown-ups but so important to the young; how entire romantic relationships can be started simply by two people glancing at each other across a room for a little too long, entire friendships destroyed simply because of not sitting at a certain table during a public meal. Sheesh, if that's not a teenage girl's life in a nutshell, I don't know what is.In fact, I'll go so far as to say this; that at least here inNorthanger Abbey, Austen turns out to be amuchsmarter,muchmore bitter author than I was expecting, given that her most diehard fans concentrate so much on the historical-finery and antiquated-courtship elements of it all. And indeed, if I wanted to be really controversial, I'd argue that if Austen were alive and writing in our modern times, she wouldn't write about relationships at all, but was instead forced to during her own times because of this being the only stuff female authors could get published back then. I mean, don't get me wrong, this book contains an unbelievable amount of the same tropes as so-called modern \"chick-lit,\" which is why so many people call her the forerunner of the genre*; but if you pay attention, you'll see that Catherine herself is really not that interested in the subject at all, other than to the extent that it's expected of her by the rest of society, and indeed you could argue that Austen's bigger point here is to examine the growing dark maturity and evermore complex understanding of the world that all young women go through, and the sometimes ugly experiences that must occur for this to happen. It's for all these reasons that I confidently labelNorthanger Abbeytoday a classic, a surprisingly still-relevant tale that even to this day is almost impossible not to be thoroughly charmed by.Is it a classic?Yes*And speaking of chick-lit, no review ofNorthanger Abbeyis complete without an acknowledgment of its absolutely most delightful aspect, an examination of what at the time was the first-ever rise in popularity of the \"novel\" format, especially as it manifested itself in the form of trashy supernatural romantic thrillers designed specifically for middle-class women. Let's not forget, before the late 1700s, full-length fictional stories barely even existed; when people sat down to read a book back then, it was mostly essays or poems or plays they were picking up, with full-length made-up narrative stories treated by the intelligentsia with the same disdain we currently treat, say, first-person-shooter videogames. It was during this same period, though, that women suddenly became literate in the millions for the first time in history; and these women all needed something to read, which is what led to the rise of \"gothic\" literature in the first place, a combination of supernatural thriller and over-the-top romance that was generally perceived at the time as \"silly woman stuff.\" This novel is just as enjoyable and important for its examination of all these issues as it is for the usual Austenesque stuff; and this is yet another reason to call Austen a forerunner of modern so-called chick-lit, in that all these issues are still being debated in the publishing industry to this day."

        "user_review": "The Jane Austen binge continues. I must admit that I hit a wall with this one.Sense and Sensibilitymoved along so merrily and with great suspense, while Northanger Abbey had a few moments where I thought, \"Oh gosh, do I really have to pick this book up again?\"After I finished the novel I started doing more research including reading the introduction by crime writerVal McDermid(I make it a policy never to read introductions as I they often include spoilers), and realized that this was the first novel Austen wrote.From that lens it all makes sense. The novel has the feeling of being with someone who is trying on various outfits. Austen plays around with the gothic and supernatural, a la Women in White or Frankenstein, with varying degrees of success. Yet her sparkling Austen wit is simmering beneath the surface. This makes for a tone that is a bit uneven: mysterious characters, romantic comedy scenes, moral digression.You also see the origins of Austen's house fixation (she really likes nice houses); Her overwrought and romanticized description of Northanger Abbey was one of the sections of the book where I needed a breather. There is also a really interesting moral condemnation of romanticism, which I think was Austen's illustration of her female protagonist evolving from a girl to woman. It's a transition that she handles as a first-time novelist, successfully in many areas, but also a bit heavy-handed in others.However, it's all good work, because you see the foundations of her later beloved characters in these experiments. Isabella, the annoying female who is slippery and selfish speaks more in monologues than Austen's later works has so much meat to her and reincarnates into many of Austen's beloved later characters. Her sketch of the rake is suitable annoying but still a bit unrefined. And as for Mr. Tilney, the love interest, the tension is not quite there, but you have all her other books to look forward to."

        "user_review": "I understand this novel is a satire. I also understand that this book was published posthumously and so right now, Jane Austin may very well be rolling in her grave saying \"Oh God, I can'tbelievethey publishedNorthanger Abbey.\" I understand I am one of very few people who feel this way. However, Idofeel this way.You can't just write a book about incredibly irritating characters who are flustered by very trivial situations and then say \"oh no, but it's a satireaboutbooks that have incredibly irritating characters who are flustered by very trivial situations.\"That's fantastic. But satire or no, I am still reading a book about incredibly irritating characters who are flustered by very trivial situations! It's similar to people liking things ironically. The irony is irrelevant. You still like the thing.Look, it didn't escape me. I saw the satire. I particularly enjoyed Mrs. Allen and Isabella. I didn't even mind Catherine. She was quite sweet, really. But for me it was just all a little tedious. And I imagined Henry to beeonsolder than Catherine. He treated her like a little sister more than anything, but maybe that's what flirting was like in 1817.However, I'm incredibly excited to read Pride and Prejudice again.I wrote a nasty one star reviewwhen I was about 17 and I've been waiting almost ten years to revisit it. I have an idea thatNorthanger Abbeyis actually much worse than P&P and so if I've given this two stars I might even give P&P three! How very thrilling."

        "user_review": "Everyone seems to leave poor Northanger Abbey to read last out of all of Austen's novels. Why is this? For me, I still have Emma to go – I really don't like the sound of Emma as a character (and yes I have been a little influenced by the movie and mini series adaptations).Perhaps it is because being the first full length novel of Austen's, Northanger is the least developed or mature example of her writing – I think she peaked with Persuasion, and certainly Sense and Sensibility, with Pride and Prejudice being the most popular overall simply for being a brilliant romance if nothing else.Northanger is a much simpler story, and to be honest the beginning and even the middle seems to drag quite a bit – so many promenades and carriage rides and insipid gossip and worrying about what the neighbours will think…It really picks up speed and sparks interest in the last third, once Catherine is finally installed at the Abbey.What I do think is underrated about this novel is Mr Tilney as our male hero. For once he is likeable and reliable from the outset. He may not be dark and brooding like Darcy or adventurous and scorned like Wentworth, but he is admirably honest, intelligent, rational and most importantly just downright pleasant. What Catherine enjoys most is his simple company and good conversation. Do we always need the melodrama, the hot and heavy over the top interludes accompanied by tears and tantrums and general emotional turmoil?This is actually one of the few examples of where rather than the love interest between the two main characters causing all the heartache, it is the love interest between minor characters (Isabelle and James and then Captain Tilney) and the despair women inflict upon women (Catherine's disappointment in Isabelle's true character) that is the main focus. This is quite interesting, because in reality, it is often women who are women's worst enemy, not men!With only one Austen to go (Emma), it's a little disheartening to know that the discovery of Austen is coming to an end and that while rereading is immensely pleasurable and nostalgic, nothing compares to the virgin reading of a really great book. Then again, can we ever have too much of Captain Wentworth or Mr Darcy (my two favourites) or even the naughty Henry Crawford? These are surely men who have aged well!"

Usually, the first-ever novels of writers speaks volumes about their own persona.Be it Isabelle's vivacity and proclivity towards lies, or the self-conceit of Mr. Tilney to the delicate-woven love between Catherine and Henry, it is a perfect gothic yet-not-so gothic but sheer-love mystery.I patiently waited to know more about Henry and his pursuits, but Jane Austen dabbled more into introducing Catherine into the gothic setup of our favorite Northanger Abbey.NB- I was highly moved with the short yet warm role of Mrs. and Mr. Morland which balanced the parental tyranny of the plot with parental freedom and affection."

And yet, in this fun, Gothic parody, Austen makes her just that!Catherine has a preoccupation with the female Gothic genre that influences how she views the world around her. There is much to unpack and explore, in the characters of her new Bath acquaintances, and an opportunity to do so is soon provided, when she is invited to journey to the Abbey home of her new friends, the Tilneys. But will Mrs Radcliffe let her stay there be as restful and joyous as she is anticipating...This felt very much like a novel of two halves, with the former dominated by a depiction of fashionable life in bath, complete with an understanding garnered of the correct etiquette and conduct of the young people of that day and place in society. The latter portion was set within the walls of the Abbey and it was here that the Gothic elements begun to reveal themselves.This novel was just pure, tongue-in-cheek, escapist fun! It retained such a light-hearted tone throughout and provided a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience throughout, which was exactly what I desired during these trying times."

        "user_review": "Dear Sam Spade,This is the stuff that dreams are made of.Love,Areeba.Northanger Abbey is so underrated. The heroine of this book is into sports and shenanigans growing up and doesn't learn anything in school and have any accomplishments or interests until she has a growth spurt, gets hot, reads so many gothic novels that she almost ruins her relationship with her love interest because she convinces herself his house is haunted and does an inappropriate ghost hunt.She is the queen 👑 but let's be real every Jane Austen heroine is a queen and every Jane Austen hero is destined to end up in my \"i-love-him\" shelf. I have said it time and again thatJane Austen is one of, if not the best, author out there.\"Northanger Abbey\" is, in part,a satire of Gothic novels. Catherine Morland, our protagonist, has yet to establish a clear dividing line between the imagined world and the real. Catherine isn't actually delusional; she doesn't go tilting at windmills. But because she sees the world through the prism of Gothic novels, her understanding is often wildly off the mark.The action begins in the hothouse atmosphere of Bath. Encouraged by her new friend, the shallow Isabella Thorpe, Catherine consumes Gothic novels with much more eagerness than she takes the waters. She finds better friends in the Tilneys: lovely Eleanor and her brother, Henry, a charming young clergyman. Their father, the General, is a dour widower. Invited to their family home, the abbey of the novel's title, Catherine finds herself surrounded by the familiar elements of Gothic romance —a rambling building, forbidden rooms, secret compartments, hidden portraits— and conjures a mystery from them. She imagines that the circumstances of Mrs. Tilney's death must have been as gothic as her surroundings. But of course it turns out she was wrong and she risks losing Henry's affection. Mortified by her error, she realizes that she must learn to distinguish between shades of gray.She must, in short, grow up.Dear Jane Austen, how just how did you come up with this? And as for Mr. Henry Tilney (and Mr. Darcy):womanman. No really why must you do this to me? Catherine confesses to Mr. Tilney and he shoots her down saying \"I love you\" where just where do i find such a man?And Catherine is such a good person down to her core it made me cry and it made me feel bad for you know ... being bad.Oh and Henry Tilney gahhhhhhhhhhh lkgfjgufgiohljhgdfhg hearts hearts everywhere he is so nice. It's men like this guy that make me question why i even bother rooting for the villain.Just know that this woman can do no wrong. There's a reason behind the fact that I, one of the most cynical people in the world, who hates nearly everything, who pokes fun at others favorites, has Jane Austen on the top of her favorite authors list. And what is the reason?Austen introduces me to ... myself in her books - and i am pretty well dressed. She reminds us everyone is flawed—even our beloved heroines—but they, and we, can change...."

I am more a fan of the Bronte sisters as feel their novels are more intense and atmospheric whereas Austen tends to be more lighthearted and romantic in my opinion.I came across this on Audible Original narrated by Emma Thompson and stuck for something to listen to on a car journey I figured I would give it a try. Unfortunately this was in performance style and was like listening to a play which doesn't work for me, however I stuck with it to the end as it wasn't the worst book I ever listened to but this may have been down to Emma Thomson's performance as on of the narrator.A coming of age story about 17 year old Catherine Moreland who on a trip to Bath meets and falls in love with Henry Tilley a handson young clergyman.. I understand that this was one of her first novels and she may not have intended on having it published. It's a satire of the popular gothic fiction of Austen's day.Another Classic crossed off my TBR list but not a book for my favourites shelf."

        "user_review": "I don't know about all of you all, but I keep work in progress reviews on my computer, saved in word documents. I recently went through my file, feeling a bit of nostalgia looking through some of the ones I never finished (some for very good reasons as they were dreadful and shall never see the light of day again). I then stumbled upon my review for this book. Unlike the others it was completely finished (although it had a few errors that I've since corrected). Reading it I remembered why I never posted it and decided that it needed to be corrected ASAP.As you can see above, I gave the novel 1 star and clearly did not like it. My opinion has not changed and indeed looking at it I smiled as I still agree completely with Tim from 2017. Why didn't I post it? Well, I've mentioned in a few of my reviews that I struggle with depression and anxiety. 2017 was an extremely bad year for it. I clearly remember thinking at the time that I couldn't post it because \"It's Jane Austen. You can't dislike Jane Austen novels. You're not allowed to not like them. If you dislike it, people will hate you. Don't do this.\"Yes, it was a very bad time for Tim's brain.Well, fortunately the Tim of today is at least slightly more well adjusted (not much mind you…) and I frankly I liked this one. Guess I'll just post it now before my brain kicks into panic mode again.______________Northanger Abbey is Austen's parody of the gothic… at least it is for maybe the first twenty pages and the last twenty, other than that it's a below standard romantic comedy. Don't be fooled by the gothic name drops and intriguing start; this is your standard fill-in-the-blanks framework filled with misunderstandings, parental disapproval and \"oh dear me I made a mistake that was so bloody stupid that everyone had to know where this was going, but I need sympathy because I'm the lead and because this is a Jane Austin novel I must be endearing.\" Seriously, this is one of the most annoying main characters I've ever read. I'm frequently willing to suspend disbelief but the stupidity of her actions made me question how I'm supposed to identify or even tolerate her.As I mentioned it's known for the gothic parody parts, and some of them are amusing (though frustrating because of our lead's annoying actions). She honestly comes off like a parent's worst fears, just substitute gothic novels for video games and a \"oh dear, our child has been brainwashed by the media and will act on it.\" Well, that's silly. Even children understand the difference between reality and fiction and… oh nevermind, there she goes looking for proof of the sinister. Obviously not genre savvy or you would know this is the wrong sort of book to find a madwoman in the attic.Had the book contained more gothic elements rather than starting with them, forgetting about them for almost two hundred pages before running back to them like you didn't make a narrative mistake, it would have possibly been more entertaining. Instead it feels like it a bad mishmash that has no clue what it wants to be.I would now like to clarify that somewhere in the flinty pits of my petrified heart I wanted to like this book. I think that's why this review is so actively angry. I majored in English, I wrote several pages on the Gothics and frankly a parody of them by such a well loved author sounded amazing. Yes, I went into it expecting something that it wasn't… usually I'd say that's on me… but this time it really does feel like the only reason this book is remembered (other than because of who the author is) is because of the gothic parody aspect. That's all that's mentioned… and there's just not much of this. If you go into it expecting a parody, you'll likely be disappointed (as I very much am). If you're going in expecting a standard Jane Austen novel (on what had to be an off period of writing for her) perhaps you'll like it. I sure as hell did not. 1/5 stars_______________There you go past Tim! It's posted! Feel relived............Please don't hate me."

The two fastest ways to develop a healthy loathing for the human race and its destiny is to serve food, or clean up after it, on the minimum wage. I have done both jobs, in those terrible days when I was forced to work for a living. It was horrible. I shudder now in thinking about it. That's where I learned that nothing ever really changes.\"\"When we're young, we think that suffering is something that's done to us. When we get older - when the steel door slams shut, in one way or another - we know that suffering is measured by what's taken away from us.\"\"Guilt is the hilt of the knife that we use on ourselves, and love is often the blade; but it's worry that keeps the knife sharp, and worry that gets most of us, in the end.\"\"At first, when we truly love someone, our greatest fear is that the loved one will stop loving us. What we should fear and dread, of course, is that we won't stop loving them, even after they're dead and gone.\""

Are you sure, Gregory? Because, personally, I prefer my seas blue, the way nature intended them to be. Personally, I'd be a little terrified if the seas turned green, because that would mean a huge increase in the number of phytoplankton, which would in turn affect the ocean food web, which might then lead to a mass extinction of ocean-dwelling species, which is really rather less than perfect, isn't it, Greg?

I could have been doing something important like closing my eyes really tight to see an intersting light show or going through my neighbors trash.A great deal of this book is obviously autobiographical. I base this clever decution on the fact that the author, who is a former convict who escaped from prison and fled to Bombay where he lived in the slums, started a free medical clinic and joined the mafia, writes a book about a guy who escapes from prison and flees to Bomabay where he lives in the slums, starts a free medical clinis and joins the mafia. As such, it is written in the manner of someone who is scared of offending their former host and who also seems concerned that flaws in the main character will reflect badly on himself, the author. This sacrifices any possibility of creating an intersting, dynamic or realistic main character. It is comletely uncompelling and entirely unbelievable. The story of a westerner who integrates himself into Indian society, starting in the slums, should be facinating. To read this, everything and everyone is wonderful, the people are all so loving and beautiful, blah blah blah. Maybe all that is true, but hey there main character, weren't you a little frustrated and embarrassed when everyone in town lined up to watch you take a crap every morning? Everything negative the character experiences is presented as an account of facts, everything positive is a big sappy gush fest. Give me a break.Then the reader is then regaled with pages upon pages of various characters spoon feeding each other philosphy. Sad twelve year old girls writing poetry could provide more inspiration.I don't understand why this book gets such good reviews. There are so many amazing books about India. Read one of them. Better yet, just go to India. The money you would spend on this book will get you at least 2 meals depending on where you are. If you've had the misfortune of receiving this book as a gift, use it to kill spiders or keep it by your bedside to throw at possible intruders. Just don't waste your time reading it."

It was given to me by a friend of mine who loved it, and said that before she read it she had no desire to go to India, but after having read it she couldn't wait to go.This book is over 900 pages, so I found it a little challenging to start b/c I didn't want to carry it around with me to read on the bus (too bulky) and I was so tired each night that I couldn't read more than a page or two. But I finally got a chance to read a small chunk of it in one sitting and that was it for me. I loved it and couldn't put it down.There are a few notable things about this book. One is that it's billed as a novel but I'm 90% certain that these things all actually happened to the author. I think he wrote it as a novel so he could change some names and protect the innocent (or guilty). Another amazing thing is how well it's written. This guy isn't really a trained writer, and I think he has a natural ability which is very rare. I am exceedingly critical of bad writing styles, and not once did anything in this book irritate me. Perhaps because he is such a great writer, all of the characters are well developed and you find yourself wanting to know what happens with each of them--and there are a lot. I honestly couldn't name all the characters he describes in detail--more than probably any other book I've read. But at no point did I find myself thinking I couldn't keep track of who was who (which I often do), and I really cared about each of these people personally.The story itself is phenomenal, and I have been giving this book to everyone I know. Read it. It's amazing and it will be one of the best books you've ever read."

        "user_review": "If I met the protagonist, Linbaba, in the flesh, I'd, well, I'd beg my meatiest friend to rough him up. Repeatedly. Lin's adventures in Bombay are apparently based on humble author Gregory David Roberts's exploits playing savior and mafiosi there while in hiding after a daring escape from an Australian prison (thanks for a fellow goodreader for correcting me ---I had previously written New Zealand). LinBaba becomes irksome and tiresome after Part 1, repeatedly offering little nuggets of pseudowisdom to summarize what he has learned from a particular person or situation. (I actually really despise the aforementioned phrase \"nugget of wisdom\" but I find it accurate here to really emphasize the fact that these \"nuggets\" are fleeting and become utterly meaningless because there are apx. 10 per page). Along with the wisdom, most of the novel consists of the protagonist vacillating between moral extremes as either a savior of street and slum or a thug loyal to a Bombay mafia don. For all of these roles, and all of the blurring of good and evil, though, the novel still comes up short in terms of complexity --- in thought, theme, and characterization. I particularly found Lin's trust and god-like admiration of Khader, his mafia boss and father figure, too simplistic and naive.Everything was just a bit too dizzying and dazzling, like Roberts knew this was going to be picked up by Hollywood. Lin insists upon showing readers that he has connections in all of Bombay's divergent milieus --- from Bollywood, to the slums, to the mafia, to the expats and the heroin dens, LinBaba knows all. He even goes to Afghanistan in the midst of the Soviet invasion. This novel needs more unity and focus; moving from one incident to another, with a bit of wisdom in between, gets tedious and vexing.All that negativity aside, this was a grand adventure story and was, for all my complaints, entertaining. Roberts obviously has a flair for dialogue, capturing the dialects of German, French, and Indian speakers, and Prabaker, Lin's best friend in Bombay, is a standout character. Actually, he was the best part of the novel for me, and far more realistic and entertaining than anyone else."

        "user_review": "The way Roberts describes Indians in this book is like a series of bad caricatures - I cringed terribly. There is the over-friendly and smiling, trusting, barbaric, not very clever, poor Prabaker - (I HATED the way he wrote Prabaker's English. It made him sound like a racist Disney character or like the golum from LOTR) to the cool and smooth Iranian gangster (if you like ridiculous Bollywood movies, this is the book for you!) In typical fashion, the white guy is the hero of nearly every scene, a la Patrick Swayze in City of Joy, as if people who lived in slums sit around waiting for a white hero to come and save them.BUT there were things I liked about the book (aside from the sweet friend who lent it to me). It is cushioned in so much love for India and its people. And while that love is sometimes really dramatic and poorly written (like when he ends each chapter with an epiphany or worse, the love scenes) you get the sense as the book moves on that he becomes more of an insider telling the story from inside and not from outside, which is incredibly admirable. How many white people do I know that would move to the slums of Bombay, learn Marathi, visit a village, fight street dogs, etc. etc. For those moments alone, I was glad to be reading it."

        "user_review": "I feel like I betrayed myself, my family and some of my friends because I did not like this book more. My statement seems a bit rough but my heart is really heavy. This is why!I started this book 10 years ago while on a trip to Mumbai. Where else! As I was studying in Italy at that time I bought the book in Italian. I remember that I loved what I read but dropped it somewhere at page 200 in order to read it in the original language, English. I do not know how and why but 10 years have passed before I finally got to start again. In the meantime, I recommended the book to my grandma (became one of her favorite books, read it multiple times), my father (loved it) and some friends which all enjoyed it. I was so sure I will love it as well. Well, I did like it but I did not love it.For the good part, it is a ambitious adventure book with interesting facts about the Indian culture and it was mostly entertaining.My main issue with this doorstopper is that I hated the main character. That is a problem as the book is all about HIM. The book is a slightly autobiographical novel about an Australian armed robber who escapes from prison and lands himself in Mumbai. There, he moves into a slum, starts a free clinic and gets involved with the city's mafia. Many things happen to the guy and between those extraordinary events multiple philosophical ideas are inserted who tend to be quite repetitive. His struggle between his good part (savior of the slum) and his bad part (criminal activities with the Bombay Mafia ) take many boring pages. It felt like the narrator tried very, very hard to convince the reader to have a good opinion of him, that even if he is a criminal he is one of the good guys and his acts are justifiable. He has two full chapters in which he presents his philosophy of what is really evil and what is a decent crime (things like passports falsification, money laundering etc). To me Shantaram was a pompous, self-absorbed prick who tried more than half of the book to look like such a wonderful person, some sort of \"messiah\" for the residents of Mumbai. Really!? How had those Indians survived without him? Everybody loved him and respected him. He was welcomed by everybody in their homes and heart. Also, for half of the book all the characters were wonderful, with no apparent defects. I mean, even the criminals were loving, heartwarming philosophers which felt really odd."

        "user_review": "Returning to read Gregory David Roberts' epic novel again, I found myself drawn to the complexities and nuances embedded throughout the text. As the novel opens, the reader is introduced to Lin, a man who has escaped his Australian jail and arrives in Bombay, hoping to hide in India's vast populace. Early on, Lin is forced to realise that India is a beast unlike any other; culturally, racially, and economically. It is, however, home to many who have the same idea, hiding from their criminal pasts elsewhere. These include Karla Saarinen, a woman who occupies Lin's mind and dreams from the moment he lays eyes on her. As Lin befriends others who have recently arrive in country, seeking to blend into the billions around him with vague and beige backstories, he meets a tour guide, Prabaker (Prabu). Their connection is almost instantaneous, soon becoming an entertaining pair throughout the narrative. Prabu is able to help Lin make numerous connections in and around the city. While they venture out to better explore Bombay and eventually other parts of the state, Lin learns the culural differences between India and his Australian upbringing. As Prabu and Lin continue their adventures, the latter finds himself living in the city's slums and opens a medical clinic to cater to the poorest population, where Lin becomes involved with the shady underworld and black market living. Throughout the book, Lin crosses paths with those whose simple conversations turn philosophical and force him to digest complex analyses to the universe's most basic concepts. When offered a position working in forged passports by the Bombay Mafia, Lin accepts, if only to explore new pathways to survival. His living in the slums of Bombay prove not only eye opening, but life changing in ways that the reader can only understand by being enveloped in the larger narrative. Even as Lin is able to build himself up in his new homeland, he is broken by the cruelest and most sadistic Indians, especially when his identity is learned and extradition considered. Roberts offers so much in this narrative that it is hard to summarise or believe that this is the life of a single man on the run. However, where truth ends and fiction commences, the reader is permitted a front seat for everything and the chance to change alongside Lin throughout. A must read by any and all who want to offer up all they feel they know, only to finish the book and question everything.Set in the early to mid-1980s, the story weaves together a collection of vignettes within Lin's Indian life, while also telling an overarching story of change and progress. I have read that some criticise Roberts for being too free with his truths and duping the reader, though I must say that fiction is all about embellishment or at least working with a clay and forming it into an image of your choosing. Roberts' writing style is so blunt and yet smooth that the reader cannot help but get lost therein. The daunting size of the book should not deter the interested reader, as the vignettes play out easily and the characters are rich in their backstories and mesh well with the larger tale. Roberts has certainly held back little in this account of his 'life on the run', but also offers gaps significant enough to keep scores of questions floating in the minds of the attentive reader. Will these be resolved and if so, how does it all play into the narrative Roberts presents? The second volume of this quasi-memoir should tell more, though the bar has already been set quite high. I am eager to see how the detail will continue and what Roberts has to say with the handful of characters still involved in Lin's life. This is a brilliant piece of work and I can only imagine what is to come.I cannot finish this review without commenting on the narrator of the audiobook version of this massive tome. Humphrey Bower brought the story to life, from his melodious Australian accent in the narrative to the countless accents that he brought out to give characters their personality. I adore Bower's work and his dedication to another favourite author of mine made me wonder, when first I listened, if this was that writer using another name. Powerful and daunting, Bower deserves a shout out for his reading of this piece. I am worried that the second volume, which I must physically read (gasp), will prove much more difficult without Bower at the helm.Kudos, Mr. Roberts for this epic story. With simplistic writing and complex threads, a vast array of readers will surely enjoy this book. Onto the sequel, which one can hope is as exciting and life-altering.Like/hate the review?

        "user_review": "FINALLY!Gregory David Roberts says it took him 13 long and troubled years to write this book. I felt it took me that long to READ it! Because it was recommended to me, I strove to read it in its entirety.Why I found this to be a troublesome read:1. Lin (main character based on the author). Although I enjoy reading about flawed protagonists (and Lin definitely was), he comes across as an arrogant, hypocritical modern-day Robin Hood. GDR legitimizes child slavery, scoring drugs for tourists, giving \"dirty\" money to slum dwellers, counterfeiting passports, licenses, etc. while being involved with organized crime - all this didn't win any Brownie points from me, and often left me angry. Truly, an unsympathetic character from start to finish.2. This book was too long-winded! What was the editor thinking??? She should have taken some HUGE pruning shears and cut out at least 400-500 pages, starting with the endless use of inane similes and metaphors about everything, as well as his eyerolling philosophical musings! GDR writes about facial and bodily features and clothing worn by EVERYONE he meets! And how many times does he have to describe Karla's eyes, hair, lips, clothing, etc.? I get it! She's drop-dead gorgeous with green eyes, black hair, luscious lips and likes wearing green clothes! Too bad she's a one-dimensional character. The constant use of description would be something my Grade 3 students would attempt in their story writing.Some redeeming qualities:1. Slum dwellers, Johnny Cigar and Joseph, slum manager, Qasim Ali Hussein, Lin's hilarious friend, Prabaker, the Standing Babas - even Kano the Bear, were all entertaining characters, and I would have been fascinated to learn more of their stories.2. Lin's time spent in an Indian prison was the most hair-raising, engrossing part of the story for me!Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros for me in regards to quality story writing. GDR tries to describe India, its culture and its people, but if you want to read a truly captivating story about this topic, I highly recommendA Fine BalancebyRohinton Mistry."

        "user_review": "Let's get this straight from the start: according to the author this book is based on real events but it's a novel, a work of fiction – not an autobiography. And that's ok, except as this book is clearly based heavily on the author's life I couldn't help asking myself where exactly in this tale is the fact and where is the fiction? It did make for a strange experience.Anyway, some known facts about Gregory David Roberts:- An self confessed heroin addict, in 1978 he was sentenced to 19 years imprisonment for armed robberies carried out to feed his habit.- He escaped and skipped Australia, leaving a wife and daughter behind, intending to make his way to Europe but after a stopover in Bombay (Mumbai) he decided to settle in the island city.- After being befriended by some of the locals he lived in the Navy Nagar slum for a period and also spent some time living with a family in a remote village.All of the above feature in the book, and a good deal more too. The adventures include coping with a cholera epidemic, joining the local mafia and teaming up with the Afghan Mujahedeen to fight the might of the Soviet forces. It's an epic tale that takes up a wrist busting 900 plus pages, or in my case over 42 hours of audio. I have to say that Humphrey Bower brilliantly read the audio version - he brought the characters to life and his accents were, on the whole, expertly handled.There's much more to the book than the facts I've listed above, although these do provide the basic structure for the story. I'm still trying to fully process how I feel about this one but I know there are things I loved about it and other elements that created significant misgivings.On the upside, the descriptions of India and its people are fantastic. Life in the city and in the small village is graphically portrayed and I really felt I was living these sections. Some of the characters were exceptional – I particularly loved Prabhaker, Didier, Vicram and the scarily insane Habib. I don't want to give anything away but I will say there are scenes that left me variously laughing out loud, desperately sad and/or pretty much revolted and scared witless – the latter particularly coming to the fore when our hero was temporarily incarcerated in Bombay's Arthur Road Jail. It's a book that really does stretch the emotions. I also enjoyed the way the underlying themes of freedom, loyalty, love (lots of love) and betrayal played out through the narrative.It's the way the facts are brought together that really causes me to have doubts. There is a huge amount of self-aggrandisement in the way the lead character, who adopts the alias of Lindsay Ford (Lin), is portrayed. The language throughout is flowery in the extreme, and the text is liberally sprinkled with hackneyed phrases, clichés and truisms. But the overriding flaw here is that this fictional text, written in the first person, reads like the autobiography it isn't. It confused my emotions: I wanted to admire Roberts/Lin and marvel at the acts of heroism and charity but I couldn't. And my final criticism is that it feels like a book that needed a good editor: it's way too long and I felt that some sections dragged on interminably.Overall, don't regret the time I invested in this book. Despite the doubts I've expressed I did find it very entertaining and I feel I learnt a good deal about India and it's people. I might even be persuaded to seek out the follow-up book that's kicking around now… we'll see."

        "user_review": "Have you ever been in a relationship that you were just done with but you were hoping they would end it and so you suffer through, day after day, rolling your eyes every time that person does that THING that you HATE and, yah, it was kind of fun at first but if they keep doing that THING that you HATE, you are going to end up saying something really mean and you really don't want to do that because they mean well and are nice but they just drive you up the wall?You know what you need to do? You need to save both of you more trouble and pain and just dump that person already, and frankly, that's how I feel about this book, so even though I'm nearly at the end, I can't take it anymore. I roll my eyes every few minutes, I dread turning the audiobook on. It had it's good moments and its merits but this is NOT the book for me.This book is billed as a \"semi-autobiographical\" story. I'm not sure what to make of that, though I guess it's more honest than some authors are. The story feels a bit like a diary. While the protagonist is almost always the center of any story, this one is particularly so. The main character interacts with other people, and we get some back story on them, but they are always half hearted accounts and they only serve as conduits for learning more about the narrator. This format, wherein you only ever see as far as the main character comprehends the situation, can work, but it's done so lazily, here.Throughout the book, the main character meets someone and then says something like \"I don't know why but I _____ the person right away.\" Lazy. Lazy lazy lazy writing. People feel that way, but authors owe it to their readers to make THEM feel as though they don't know why but they ____ the person. The most atrocious example of this lazy writing is the love-at-first-sight nonsense. I do genuinely believe that people feel intense attractions to certain other people at the moment they see them, but, again, it's the authors job to paint a picture that tells us what he sees in that person. At best, he gives us a portrait of a woman he thinks is beautiful and that he doesn't understand, which means the only thing we feel is that there's some pretty woman with no personality and no complexity to speak of and we are supposed to believe she's worth pining over. These many people the author interacts with, drive the story forward and serve as motivation but, at least for me, I never understood why. I don't cry why people die, I don't feel bad when people leave. I don't know why one woman is more or less desirable than another. I am simply told that this is how the character feels.While this issue struck me from the outset, there is a lot in the story that is interesting and compelling. I've only had a superficial, tourist experience with India, so learning more about everyday life and people there is wonderful, but just as I'd start to sink into the story, I'd be jarred by my second peeve about this book. The author, over and over again, stops the story to make some sort of metaphor about how some event or emotion is like some sort of grandiose, most important thing that has ever been (and pretty much everything is the most something that has ever something'ed). This isn't a case where he makes a particular point, once, maybe twice, that is central to the story. Nope, it's trite little sayings like \"Truth is a bully that we all pretend to like\" and \"Silence is the tortured mans revenge\" and \"Guilt is the hilt of the knife that we use on ourselves\" and on and on it goes, breaking up the flow of the story so the author can impress you with how clever he is. Like exclamation points and adverbs, this sort of mental masturbation needs to be applied sparingly, but it's constant and it wasn't too long before I started to get so focused on when the next detour down poetry lane would be that I simply stopped hearing the story, altogether. On the other hand, if you want to get really piss-drunk, try having a shot every time he pulls one of these gems out. You'll need your stomach pumped.I'll concede that my concerns might be largely a stylistic preference. There are certainly a fair number of people who thought this story was wonderful and poetic. It's not for me, though, and I'm happier for admitting defeat on this. I'll never know how the story ends and I'm fine with that. I give it 2 stars because there really were times when I was engrossed in the story."

        "user_review": "'Shantaram' is about the life of an escaped Australian convict with the alias 'Lin' who comes to India in order to evade his torturous fate in the prison. After landing in Bombay (now Mumbai), he befriends his tour guide Prabhakar and other expatriates who are involved in some minor illegal crimes in the city. As a man on a run, he tries to make sense of his life while he travels across the spiritual city.On his journey, the events and people around him cause his life to take a wild turn. He embarks on a series of dangerous adventures, whether it be moving to the poorest slum in Bombay, having intellectual conversations with the mafia members and getting involved in illegal activities, working for Bollywood, serving in prison, fighting in someone else's war, being fascinated with the beautiful and elusive Karla all the while being utterly clueless about his goals.Eventually, the protagonist Lin learns the most-used languages in Bombay and gets friendly with the people around him. When he goes to a trip in a small Maharashtrian village, a hometown of his friend Prabhakar, he gets acquainted with their lifestyle and starts living with them for a while. He is given the name Shantaram, meaning the man of peace, which resonates with him and seems to signal about his distant fate.First off, this was such an amazing journey! It's part autobiographical and part fiction as stated by the author. After finishing the book, I dug into the old interviews and stuff to find out how much of it is fact and fiction. He said that the major events were based on true story while the characters were an amalgamation of different personalities. Anyway, it might be hard to pinpoint the credibility, but one thing I can say for sure is it's a beautiful and well written story.\"It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured. I realised, somehow, through the screaming of my mind, that even in that shackled, bloody helplessness, I was still free: free to hate the men who were torturing me, or to forgive them. It doesn't sound like much, I know. But in the flinch and bite of the chain, when it's all you've got, that freedom is an universe of possibility. And the choice you make between hating and forgiving, can become the story of your life.\"The writing is the novel is absolutely mesmerizing and poignant. It captures all the minute intricacies in the gesture, language, values of the Indian culture seen from a foreigner's perspective. In fact, we see the protagonist experience a little bit of a cultural shock in the beginning and we see how he comes to understand and assimilate it. Also, the descriptions of the city and the events are so vivid and colorful that it captivated me. I absolutely loved reading it.The characters in the story feel so real and vulnerable. I found them so interesting in their own way, most of them were immigrants with their own reasons for seeking asylum elsewhere. It takes place over a huge expanse of the Bombay where we get to know about a lot of people in the slum and also the gangsters in the mafia. I loved the protagonist's interactions with the mafia council especially the boss. It was fun getting to learn more about how the mafia operates on various levels in the city.This book covers a wide variety of themes like friendship, love, exile, revenge, crime, poverty, communication. I feel like there's a lot for everyone. A lot of events happen due to which the protagonist's life changes a lot and we see him come to a sort of understanding of himself. The book had a witty writing and I found so many profound, 'quotable' quotes. Sometimes, I found things to be a little cheesy but I don't mind it. The story was amazing!Even though I was intimidated by the sheer size of the book in the beginning, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It has a great potential to be an amazing TV series. Hope it happens. Apart from that, I highly recommend reading the book.Read on blog"

Its worth reading this book just for his descriptions of India and the culture from his perspective. The way they build the sky scrapers, how the building has its own subculture (the builders) living next to it is amazing. This book is well worth a look. It's a tad bit long, but interesting."

        "user_review": "The New York Times nailedShantaramwhen they said that it is \"nothing if not entertaining.\" The problem is trying to find what else it is. Nine hundred pages of page-turning narrative and I wonder if I have gained anything by it. The characters lack fullness and complexity, the narrator is absurd, and the language suffers the burden of passages so heavily cliched and saturated with bite-sized pseudo-philosophical tidbits as to reduce the novel to little more than a self-help book. Here's one particularly glaring example, referring to the author's time in prison:\"Every time we turn the key we twist the knife of fate, because every time we cage a man we close him in with hate.\"I tried to look past these grotesque superfluities and let the book exist in my mind as a contemporary fluff piece, but I was overwhelmed at times. It's not that the book doesn't have its merits; the streets of Bombay, the city itself, is so well depicted that it is easily the most compelling character the book has to offer (no that that's saying much). I admit, I was mildly entertained. If the value of a book is to be judged by entertainment alone,Shantarammay be deemed by some to be worth the investment; just be prepared to knuckle down through some of the most excruciatingly horrid abuse of language I've seen in print for some time."

This is a grand, sprawling, intelligent, autobiographical novel, elegantly written and splendidly evocative of an India I would otherwise never know.As I sit here trying to decide how to best sum up just what this novel is about I realize that it is about everthing. All of life's many lessons are here in this huge, sweeping, monumental story; but mostly it is about love and forgiveness and one man's searing search for redemption.Above all, perhaps, as Pat Conroy says \"it is a grand work of extraordinary art, a thing of exceptional beauty\".Do not let the size deter you, I was hooked from the very first sentence and stayed that way through to the final word. Simply one of the most thrilling and touching novels I have ever read."

        "user_review": "I feel like a bit of an asshole for giving this three stars.Most of my goodreads friends have given this five stars, some four and one person hated it, but it feels like this is a fairly universally loved book. What is my problem?Even outside of the little goodreads universe, people love this book. Jonathan Carroll tells me in his blurb that I'm, \"either heartless or dead or both\" for remaining untouched by this book (but that is not really true, I was touched by this book, and I have a great deal of respect for the author for living this tale, more on this in a bit). Customers have raved about. I've been asked to recommend other books like this one to people. It sits perennially on the favorites table at work, co-workers stopped to tell me they either liked it or wanted to read it if they saw it in my hand while I was coming or going from the store.And it's so shiny! Can't I give it an extra star for it's golden radiant glow?If I were judging the life of the narrator, which I assume is also pretty much the life of the author, I'd give it five stars. Wow, you did all of this stuff? Pretty much everything in this book I'd be too much of lazy and scared fuck to do for myself. And then you wrote this novel while in a brutal prison and the manuscript pages are stained in your blood? Guards destroyed one of the original drafts of the book on you? I can barely wrap my head around what it would be like to go through all of that on top of living the life described in this book. Five stars, all the way (note to someone else, there should be a goodreads-esque site where people can give star ratings to other peoples' lives, that would catch on, right?)!Which, makes me feel like an even bigger asshole for only giving the book three stars.Part of the problem for me was that I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but as soon as I put the book down there I never felt compelled to pick it up and read it. I'd read on my commute and on break, but rarely would I read it at home. And even when I took a break from it on the train back to the city from upstate New York, I got my distracted watching the little arrow move on my phone's gps map showing my progress through the lower Hudson Valley and forgot to go back to reading the book on that trip for the last hour or so of my train ride. When I'd pick up the book to read it, I'd enjoy what I read, but nothing ever grabbed me with the desire to plow through the book.But is it so important that you read every book at warp-speed?No, but I want to feel compelled to go on. The only compulsion I really felt was, yeah I should pick up the book if I'm ever going to get through the 933 pages and get to read some other books. It also didn't help that I started reading this while I had a couple of other books sort of going on, too. One of them that dog evolution book that I was really not enjoying.While the events in the story were fascinating, especially since I believed them to be pretty much true, and because this guy is leading a life I couldn't imagine leading myself and being a much better person than I ever am even when he is at his worst; while all of this is true to how I felt about the content, the actually format of the book got on my nerves after awhile. It was too episodic, sort of like Dickens (whom I liked quite a bit in my only attempt to read him (shameful but true), but it's a style I can enjoy when it's in the past, but which I don't really like in contemporary novels. Too often the novel read like this: Start of chapter, deep platitude (like all door ways are passages to the infinite, meet up with the character who is going to be focal in this chapter, usually in a serendipity manner, something happens that the narrator doesn't want to do and is exhorted to try by a character ('touch his belly', 'I don't want to.', 'no, come on touch his belly,yaar', 'no, i don't want to touch his belly', 'c'mon you sister fuckeryaartouch the belly,' (go on for a bit in this way) and then he'll touch the belly (or ride the horse, or drink the weird drink, or whatever someone is trying to get him to do) and he'll find he enjoys it or takes some very valuable life lesson from it; then the narrator will do something, and have the mini-adventure of the chapter and meet some other people along the way. Which is a fine way of formatting a novel, but it started to feel really repetitive to me, and while the chapters linked together and events influenced other events I didn't feel like anything was being built by all the stories, it was just a story being told, and that is a good thing and it's a fairly entertaining story but I'm a snob who likes his 900 plus page novels to be more than just a linear story, or if it is going to be just a story I want it grab me by the throat and make me want to go on and loss sleep finding out what happens next.My other 'beef' with the novel is that it disregarded the show don't tell rule of writing. I normally don't even think about this rule when I'm reading, but I started to realize about a third of the way through the book that almost everything I knew about the characters and the type of people they are I knew because I'd been told that is the way they were by the narrator. Very little of their actions showed me the type of person they were, they might say and do interesting things but the way I was supposed to feel about the character was also given to me by some exposition of the narrator.But Greg, have you ever written a novel while being locked up in a punishment unit of an Australian prison?No.I hate when people say this, but I'm going to say it anyway and hate myself for saying it. I think the novel could have been shorter. I think that there was a clunkiness to certain parts of the novel. I'm thinking especially in the last hundred or so pages, the pages I forced myself to sit down and read and not do anything else until I was done with them today.I've been kind of critical of the book because I'm trying to justify my own like, not love for the book. I think my own feelings towards the book are sort of like the enigmatic character Karla's feelings towards other people in the novel, I like it but you can't get me to say I love it."

Her eyes the green of water lilies after the rain. Her long hair black as forest river stones. Her hair that was like holding the night itself in the wrap of my fingers. Her lips starred with incandescent light, lips of camellia petal softness, warmed with secret whispers.\"****\"grieving tears boiled up in me, relentless as the gathering tide that slapped against the seawall, but I couldn't cry them--those tears--and I felt that I was drowning in a sorrow that was bigger than the heart that tried to hold it.\"The story of an Australian prison escapee (imprisoned for armed robbery to support his heroin addiction) who works his way up from the slums of Mumbai to right hand man to the don of a mob of Indian Muslims. What seems a fascinating story to be told in around 400 pages becomes a perfect illustration of both the reason for the writing maxim \"show don't tell,\" and what happens when a first-time writer publishes a novel without the benefit of a decent editor.For example, instead of showing through actions and dialogue how he developed feelings for his main love interest, a Swedish/American named Karla, and what she did to make him love her (umm, seems to me nothing but being beautiful), he must describe in cringing, gushing prose how much he loves her: over the moon and larger than any star in our universe--every friggin' time he sees her.The romance becomes wincingly melodramatic. And it and the rest of the story devolve into the narrator's long-winded, overwrought, self-righteous and repetitive tribute, at its worst, to himself, and, at its best, to the people of Mumbai.By page 700, I was reaching for the anti-nausea meds. Right now, I feel like I just drank a dozen cans of sweetened condensed milk:I heard his voice passing from his chest to mine like ocean sonancies, sounding and resounding, wave on wave, through shores of tight-wet sand at night. Eyes closed and clinging to him, I floated on the dark water of the sorrowing I'd done for him...."

The author's description of arriving in Mumbai is so similar to my experience - the sites and smells, staying in Colaba, the restaurants visited - it really brought back my trip to a city I loved.However, I've had to put this one down for a bit of a break. I just have the feeling Gregory David Roberts is pretty far up his own ass and I'm not sure I'm buying what he's selling.What's making it hard to just sit back and enjoy this book is Robert's description of specific experiences - usually ones outside the usual North American experience (staying in a remote village, the Standing Babas, living in a slum, etc.) seem a bit far fetched to me. He goes to the village and Ack! Flood! While seeing the Babas - Eeek! Knife attack! And his first day in the slum? Fire! Fire! Fire!To be sure, there are a lot of stories and cultural experiences to be had in another country, particularly in one like India. I'm just not sure if I buy that Robertspersonally experiencedall of them.When I was in Agra, seeing the Taj Mahal, we were told that the towers surrounding the Taj used to be open to the public, but that they became a popular spot for love sick suicides, and are now closed. I have a feeling that if Roberts heard this story, he would have been standing at the foot of the tower when a lovelorn jumper took his last leap -- and would have an even barfier description for it than \"a lovelorn jumper took his last leap\"...I don't know why I'm having trouble with this book because the stories are interesting. Maybe if I didn't feel like Roberts was trying to convince me that this is TOTALLY COMPLETELY TRUE YOU GUYS as opposed to a more fictionalized memoir, maybe I could, but for now it's back on the shelf."

A sprawling novel favoured by backpackers the world over. It polarises opinion; readers either love or hate it. It's overly self-righteous and puts you in mind of Walter Mitty, but the author has certainly suffered for his art, creating a novel that is difficult to ignore."

And it was; in between the parts where he mopes over lost loves so much that you feel like you're back in a middle school girl gripefest.I had been told that this was a philosophically profound book. And it was; except for the passages where Roberts smug knowledge of \"complexity\" made you want to punch every philosophy major you ever knew right in the face as a proxy.I had been told that this was a riveting page turner. And it was; until he gets so wrapped up in the history of goats/camels/horses and the kalishnekov rifle, that you feel like he's holding one to your head daring you abandon the 700 pages you've already read.I had been told that it was a great way for expat citizens in India to reflect on their place in the diverse culture of the land. It was. There isn't a qualifying statement here. It actually was a great way, as an expat citizen in India, to reflect on my place in the diverse culture of the land. His insouciance--despite the hardened criminal overtones--is reminscent of how we all feel upon those first staggered steps off the plane. His admiration and love for the people and their language and the locales all around mirror the infectious nature of the people and place I've come to love while living here. The sites and sounds of Mumbai are thrillingly memorable, even for tourists, Leopolds, Colaba, The Taj Hotel, Haji Ali Mosque, and on and on.It's understandable that a first novel is so inconsistent. It's unfortunate that this inconsistency is spread out over 900+ pages. Turning otherwise negligible faults into major detractions from the merits of an otherwise enjoyable, but not superb book."

        "user_review": "Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts is a huge yet hard-to-put-down novel. The blurb says it is based on the life of the author, but is also part fiction. Several seemingly unnatural events corroborate the fact. Fiction or not, the book kept me hooked for the entire duration.The simplistic writing style results in a near-perfect narration of the epic story that is Shantaram. Various intricacies, including the subtle ones, that make up the Indian culture are beautifully captured. The detailed description of Mumbai, both literally and figuratively, is sure to make the reader fall in love with the city, given they aren't already in love with it.The characters seem as real as they can get (special mention to Prabaker, the protagonist's friend). The theory related to the Big Bang, the matter, and how everything in the universe is approaching towards a common goal, is mesmerizing.Most (if not all) of the emotions known to man are covered in the story. It is an epic tale of love and friendship, of crime and poverty, and of revenge and exile.The prose is full of wise quotes throughout. It makes one reflect on the way we look at life. Few instances:\"wisdom, in one sense, is the opposite of love. Love survives in us precisely because it isn't wise.\"\"The truth is a bully we all pretend to like.\"\"What we call cowardice is often just another name for being taken by surprise, and courage is seldom any better than simply being well prepared.\"\"And I'd learned, the hard way, that sometimes, even with the purest intentions, we make things worse when we do our best to make things better.\"\"the cost of knowing love, is sometimes greater than any heart would willingly pay.\"\"I think wisdom is very overrated. Wisdom is just cleverness, with all the guts kicked out of it.\"\"I was too young, then, to know that dead lovers are the toughest rivals.\"\"Guilt is the hilt of the knife that we use on ourselves, and love is often the blade; but it's worry that keeps the knife sharp, and worry that gets most of us, in the end.\"\"It's isn't a secret, unless keeping it hurts.\"\"Hate is a very resilient thing, you know. Hate is a survivor.\"\"it's impossible to despise someone you honestly pity, and to shun someone you truly love.\"\"People haven't stopped believing in love. They haven't stopped wanting to be in love. They just don't believe in a happy ending anymore. They still believe in love, and falling in love, but they know now that... they know that romances almost never end as well as they begin.\"\"It's a fact of being in love that we often pay no attention whatsoever to the substance of what a lover says, while being intoxicated to ecstasy by the way it's said.\"\"love cannot be tested. Honesty can be tested and loyalty. But there is not test for love. Love goes on forever, once it begins, even if we come to hate the one we love.\"\"'Sometimes it is necessary to do the wrong thing for the right reasons. The important thing is to be sure that our reasons are right, and that we admit the wrong-that we do not lie to ourselves, and convince ourselves that what we do is right.\"\"You can't kill love. You can't even kill it with hate. You can kill in-love, and loving, and even loveliness. You can kill them all, or numb them into dense, leaden regret, but you can't kill love itself. Love is the passionate search for a truth other than your own; and once you feel it, honestly and completely, love is forever. Every act of love, every moment of the heart reaching out, is a part of the universal good: it's a part of God, or what we call God, and it can never die.\"\"Love is a one-way street. Love, like respect isn't something you get; it's something you give.\"\"It's bad, loving someone you can't forgive.\"Looking forward to watch the movie based on this book, and then on to its sequel.Verdict: A must read."

I wanted to know more about Lin's life and just keep hearing about his insights and about India and whatever he wanted to talk about. This book is a semi-autobiographical story of a man who escapes prison in Australia and escapes to Bombay and lives there for many years. First he sets up a clinic in the slums and then he works for the Bombay mafia and in the meantime, he just has a way of describing people and life that is brilliant and endearing.In the way of criticism, I think there are parts of the book that could have been edited and taken out and there are other parts that read more as a mystery novel or an adventure than a memoir. There are also parts that sound a bit self-helpish. Also, there were a few lines (maybe about 6 out of the 900 pages) where I had to roll my eyes because they were cliched or just cheesy.But in general, the positive way outweigh the negative. It was beautiful--the writing and the images and the insights. I would read it again and recommend it to anyone.I discovered the book in Bali. A few of our friends were reading it and it was turning into a cult classic and you couldn't find a single copy on the whole island. Internationally, I think the book is gaining some steam. It's such a unique book. I am so glad I found it."

        "user_review": "Poor Erik Larson.He wanted to write an extensive, in-depth look at the 1893 World's Fair, which was a collaboration of some of the greatest creative minds in the country (including the guy who designed the Flatiron building in New York and Walt Disney's dad) and gave us, among other things, the Ferris Wheel, the zipper, shredded wheat, and Columbus Day. The entire venture was almost a disaster, with delays, petty fighting, bad weather, and more delays, but it was ultimately a massive success and helped make the city of Chicago what it is today.Here's what it must have looked like when Larson pitched his idea for the book:Larson: \"And the fair didn't go flawlessly - towards the end of the fair, the mayor of Chicago was assassinated by a crazy guy, and there were tons of disappearances over the course of the fair, and a lot of them were probably the work of this serial killer who had opened a hotel near the fairgrounds -Editor: \"Wait, serial killer? And it's connected to the fair? Cool, let's try to include that in the book. Also the crazy assassin sounds good, too.\"Larson: \"No, the killer - H.H. Holmes - really wasn't connected to the fair at all. I mean, he used the fair as a way to collect victims, but he would have killed tons of people even without it. In fact, after the fair he moved on and kept murdering people, so the fair really didn't have any effect on his methods...\"Editor: \"Doesn't matter! How about you alternate between chapters about the fair and chapters about Holmes killing people?\"Larson: \"But I don't really know much about that. Nobody does - Holmes never admitted to killing all those people, even after the police found human remains in his basement. I don't really know any actual details about the killings.\"Editor: \"That's okay, you can just make it up. I'll give you some trashy crime novels to read, that'll give you some ideas. Now tell me more about the assassination.\"Larson: \"He was just some mentally unbalanced person who thought he deserved a position in the mayor's office and shot the guy when he realized it wasn't going to happen. But the death cast a pall over the entire closing ceremony of the fair, and it - \"Editor: \"Good, let's sprinkle in some bits about the crazy guy throughout the book, too. Now, back to Holmes: did he maybe kill somebody at the fair, or did they find a body on the grounds or something?\"Larson: \"No, the Chicago police didn't even notice anything was happening. It wasn't until he left Chicago that a detective from another state tracked him down.\"Editor: \"Okay, so we'll make the end of the book about the manhunt for Holmes and his capture.\"Larson: \"What does any of this have to do with the World's Fair?\"Editor: \"Hell if I know. You're the writer, not me - you figure it out. Here's a check. Now go make me a bestseller!\"Four stars for the World's Fair stuff, two stars for the pulpy unrelated bullshit."

        "user_review": "This book is two, two,two books in one!Sorry, that was annoying. But it's almost as if Erik Larson wrote two really short books—one about the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and another about the murder spree of Dr. H. H. Holmes—and then shoved them together to create a single story. The result isn'tbad, and I think Larson is successful at maintaining clean seams between the two narratives, but it's hard to argue these two occurrences are anything but abstractedly related. Yes, Holmes lived in Chicago at the time of the fair and lured a bunch of people to his murder castle (he be snatchin' yo' peopleup!), but the events didn't weigh heavily on the fair itself or on the atmosphere surrounding it. No alarm bells went off anywhere in Chicago as a result of his, um, unsavory indiscretions.Still, there is a lot of interesting stuff here, information specific to the world's fair, and it is fun to learn new things. For example, the Chicago Columbian Exposition exudes a long list of firsts: it saw the invention of the world's first ferris wheel, it led the nation in its first public observance of the Pledge of Allegiance, and it helped to establish alternating current as the industry standard for electricity distribution. Even that awfulsnake charmer songhas its origins in the Chicago World's Fair.While writing this review, I've come to learn that Leonardo DiCaprio, that beautiful man with the screaming cherry tomato head on a toothpick body, is producing the film adaptation, and will also play the role of serial killer H. H. Holmes. For this I am pleased."

H. Holmes (one of America's most famous serial killers) took full advantage. He stalked the streets and murdered whomever he pleased.I really liked the idea of this one - to take one of America's greatest triumphs and splicing his story along with one of the greatest horrors. However. There's too high of a disconnect between these two sidesThis reads liketwo separate booksthrown together at inopportune moments - as soon one half got the least bit exciting, we'd swap. It wasfrustrating and ultimately exasperatingto read.The World Fair section was interesting in its own right, but itpaled so much in comparisonto the serial killer that it became something toslog through.For theWorld's Fair- we see the entirety of its creation and eventual destruction. Ample page space was given to dissecting every. single. mind-numbing. detail.Roughly half the book was wasted onpetty squabblesabout the building paint, boats in the harbor and the landscaping. (I finally understand how my mother can fall asleep while reading.)Then, once I nodded off between 2-3 times, we'd jump to the insane murderer. But, there was a huge disconnect regarding page space.The longer the book went on, the shorter those H. H. Holmes sections would be - towards the end, we'd only getwe'd get 1 to 10 pages from H. H. Holmes' perspectivefor every couple chapters of building plans. Fabulous.The two main stories weren't entirely separate - they did tangentially intersect - notably H. H. Holmes managed to lure so many people into his hotelbecauseof the fair and hedidtake one of his victims to the fair but those connections did not seem strong enough for a joint book.While I appreciate the time and effort it took to research such a complete account of 1893, I had a hard time enjoying the novel. It felt like more of a mess than anything.Popsugar 2018 Reading Challenge: A book you meant to read in 2017 but didn't get toYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads"

        "user_review": "Humour me and please allow the channeling an eighth grader for just a moment. OMG Squeee!!1 Teh best!! (Would an eighth grader say \"teh best\"?) And now we return you to our regularly scheduled review.I'm not a huge fan of non-fiction. Scratch that. I'm a huge fan of non-fiction, but not so huge a fan ofreadingnon-fiction. While I appreciate learning and broadening my understanding of the world around and as it once was, I find myself pretty quickly distracted from whatever non-fictional work I pick up. The fact is: most writers of non-fiction are more experts in their field of study than they are expert authors. They deliver the goods well, but aren't quite as adept at prettying them up for consumption.Erik Larson, however, is a genius. Or something. I could not put this book down. (In the figurative sense—it actually took me about two weeks to read.) The entire length of my time in this book was marked with moments of in which I would stop reading, interrupt my wife from the depths of her studies, and remarkagainhow good this book was.(I'm sure that she would have been happier had Larson just been your average purveyor of non-fictionalizations.)InThe Devil in the White City, Larson chronicles chiefly a tale of two city-dwellers. Architect, Daniel Burnham and pharmacist, Henry Holmes. One would helm the creation of a wonderland of awe-striking beauty and refinement. The other would become one of America's earliest and most diabolical serial killers. All this against the backdrop of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (a.k.a. the Chicago World's Fair).Daniel Burnham, the self-made architect, who designedthe Rookeryin Chicago would designthe Flatiron Buildingin New York, assembled a team of the best American architects of the day for the task of crafting a World's Fair in Chicago that would be even more exquisite than the one held in Paris years earlier. The Paris Exposition had also unveiled Gustave Eiffel's incredible tower, so Burnham put a call out to American engineering: something grander would have to be proposed and built. National reputation was at stake as well as civic pride. Larson explores in exciting detail the glories and the tragedies of this great endeavor.In contrast to this paean to human ingenuity and spirit, Larson focuses the other half of his narrative on a man as diligent in his chosen task as Burnham was in his. H.H. Holmes, the self-style pharmacist, who killed upwards of twenty-seven (mostly young women, fresh to the city), built for himself a hideous parody of the grand buildings that the world would soon celebrate. Bit by bit, he crafted what would later be known as his murder castle, a hotel whose ground floor hosted several businesses and whose other floors would boast far more sinister use. The second and third floors contained numerous rooms and hallways and secret compartments and switches. Airtight rooms with gas outlets. Walk-in vaults purpose not for keeping out but for keeping in. And a slicked chute to the basement where a kiln, acid, and limepits awaited. Holmes was handsome and charming in a way that made him irresistible to women. He was also a psychopath who would turn the American attention far too late.Larson, as a chronicler, is top notch. He entertains even as he educates. And he leaves just enough narrative tension to compel the reader along his path. Larson knows how to keep enough information back to avoid rendering the latter half of his book naught but excruciating anti-climax.The Devil in the White Cityis certainly an accomplishment and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.If forced to, I will admit* two quibbles with the book: 1) I was thirsty formore picturesand wanted desperately to see these buildings that Burnham and company were so busied upon; and 2) on the whole Larson keeps his voice clean of any emotive spots not merited by the characters themselves, but there were two moments when I was sure I was hearing Larson's voice beam through (it could have been worse—at least those two moments were funny).*note: see what I did there? You didn't actually have to force me."

        "user_review": "So, no offense to those that liked this book, but I'm throwing in the towel after 75 pages. It's just not holding my interest. Part of the reason for this is that Larson's writing style is way too speculative for my taste in non-fiction. I just finished readingthe Path Between Seasby David McCullough, and he does such an amazing job of making complicated, historical events interesting, without fabricating scenes that \"could have\" happened. Even that wouldn't have bothered me that much if Larson had said something more like, \"It's likely he did this, since we know this about his personality\" or whatever, rather than \"He reached out and touched her hand as he spoke to her.\" There was no clear distinction between what definitely happened, and what maybe could have happened. That got bothersome.I could have just ignored the non-fiction aspect and enjoyed the story, if not for Larson's habit of getting bogged down in inconsequential details. He seemed to throw facts (or conjectured facts) in whenever the fancy struck him, rather than keeping the story moving.And finally, I got annoyed with the jumping back and forth between Holmes's story and the architecture/Worlds Fair story. Just when I'd get into one, we'd switch to the other. He could have done a better job of interweaving those.So, since my curiosity is piqued, but not enough to continue reading this book, I'm just going to do some Wikipedia reading and call it good."

        "user_review": "[Edited, pictures added 1/5/21]A fascinating book and an easy read. Chapter by chapter, in simple chronological order, the author juxtaposes preparations for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with the doings of one of the country's first serial murderers. A movie is in the works.From the Fair chapters we learn how Chicago's boosterism won it the fair from other competitors including Washington and New York. Construction was last-minute and in panic mode, but it got done. There's a lot about Frederick Law Olmstead who was in charge of park design but he was elderly, in poor health, and struggling to stay on top of the project. A lot of the focus is on the lead architect and fair planner, Daniel Burnham, and construction of the \"White City,\" as the classical buildings came to be known.The serial killer was H. H. Holmes, a pharmacist who capitalized on the World's Fair by building a hotel. It had special rooms in the basement to kill his victims and dispose of their bodies in a gas oven. Mostly his victims were young women but he was an equal opportunity killer, murdering some men and children as well – at least 20 victims but maybe many more.The author spares us most of the gory details. Once you get into it, it's hard to believe this story is NON-fiction as the author insists on telling us, but all the events really are from diaries, letters, newspapers and police reports. Fascinating, with a lot of local color of the Windy City in that era.Eric Larson (b. 1954) specializes in writing fictional accounts of historical events. Two of his better-known books are Isaac's Storm about the hurricane that destroyed Galveston TX in 1900, and Dead Wake about the sinking of the Lusitania.Top photo of the Chicago World's Fair from architecture.comHH Holmes from soapboxie.comThe author from independent.com"

In a short while after winning the contest to hold this extravaganza beating St. Louis, Washington and the big enemy New York City for the honor from Congress the next step yes committees , Americans love them they multiply like rabbits but get in the way of progress. At long last emerging from countless delays, officially named the \"World's Columbian Exposition\" to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America, in 1492, but its six months run will start a year later in 1893. A leading Chicago architect Mr. Daniel Burnham and his partner John Root are chosen for the enormous job to build it, but also residing in the overcrowded fast growing, violent, dirty city Dr. Herman Webster Mudgett alias (one of many ) H.H.(Henry) Holmes, America's first well known serial killer. The two will never meet but their stories will make headlines around the globe. Mr. Burnham task seems impossible, made worse when his closest friend in business and in private life dies John Root, the committees don't and can't make decisions; days pass still nothing is being accomplished, at last the authority is granted him to be the boss, Burnham (\" Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood\"). Slowly things begin to appear on a grand- scale the white, ( all the same color) huge, electrified buildings soaring into the sky, the scary, new Ferris Wheel will take you there if it is ever built, lagoons are made islands formed canals dug the waters come from sparkling Lake Michigan, boats follow, the ugly, empty Jackson Park begins to fill, something special even at this early stage is felt...Dr.Holmes likes pretty young women , just off farms and small towns, the feelings are mutual he pays attention to their every word, looks into their eyes, touches them gently the handsome, soft, well spoken con man has plenty of charm few are not enamored, wealthy too, owner of the strange rather gloomy, with mysterious odors the World's Fair Hotel nicknamed \"The Castle \", he keeps marrying the women a real lady killer...but will murder men too. This nonfiction book is very entertaining and always informative, you can imagine yourself back to the spectacular, enormously successful , thrilling, magical fair the numerous attractions in hundreds of buildings, from the very popular, exotic , belly dancers to the unsuitable Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show , he made a fortune just outside the exposition grounds , they don't make this kind anymore.."

        "user_review": "Larson could be the worst nonfiction writer working in America today. When he notes that \"[Frederick Law] Olmsted was no literary stylist. Sentences wandered through the report like morning glory through the pickets of a fence\" he might as well be describing himself. It's painful to make your way through his books. The melodrama is over the top. He'll go on for several pages about some unnamed person, attempting to heighten the \"mystery,\" and anyone who graduated second grade will quickly realize he's talking about the inventor of the Ferris Wheel. But only several chapters later - in the manner of Nancy Drew abruptly tumbling to the bottom of a dark well - he'll have the mystery man dramatically sign his name to a letter: George Washington Gale Ferris. George Washington GaleFerris!!!!!!!!I did not see that coming.His narrative is peppered with the most insignificant, totally unrelated factoids, I suppose because they amused him and he couldn't stand the thought of leaving them out. He loves nothing more than to set a scene - so and so in a Pullman car or a fine dining club, this and that person on an ocean liner, attempting to send a cable to someone on theTitanic- merely in order to convey some piece of information totally unrelated to the wholly gratuitous scene. As to historical accuracy, doubtless there's a fair bit; he does have lots of end notes, and he consulted many historical sources. But he also embellishes novelistically in a way that no real historian would ever allow himself to do. It's shameful, and shameless. He asserts in the text that such and such happened, but if you check the endnotes, it didn't really happen - butit could have, he says. It was likely, he felt. After readingIsaac's Storm, which was also heavily embellished and the endnotes similarly acknowledging such, I don't trust anything this man writes. I wash my hands of him."

        "user_review": "For me, reviewing this book is similar to trying to review any Nicolas Cage movie from the past 20 years, in that if I was asked if Cage's over-the-top performance was the best thing or the worst thing about the movie, I could only answer...\"Yes!\"(Pictured - one of Nicolas Cage's more subdued performances; Not pictured - sanity)If you were to ask me my favorite thing about this book, I would immediately answer, \"Erik Larson's writing style!\"This book is mostly talked about for the portions pertaining to one of America's first serial killers, Dr. H. H. Holmes. In fact, when the greenlit movie adaptation by Martin Scorsese was recently announced, it focused primarily on the casting of Holmes. Yet, more time is spent in the book detailing the history of the 1893 World's Fair, particularly architect Daniel Burnham's struggles in trying to get everything finished in time for the Fair's opening. I'm actually not much of a history buff, so I feared the\"true crimeless\"segments of the book wouldn't hold my interest, but I'm happy to announce that I was wrong. Larson's wit made even some of the dryer parts of the novel entertaining, and he even manages to build suspense when he's raising questions we may already know the answer to, like what engineering marvel would the Fair's organizer's decide on to hopefully rival the Eiffel Tower unveiled at France's world fair?As for the segments detailing Dr. H. H. Holmes and his grotesque crimes, this is where Larson's writing really shines. Instead of treating this strictly as a historical account(\"and then this happened, and then this happened...), Larson actually writes these moments in the style of a thriller. He gets into Holmes head with the same prowess that Thomas Harris used to make Hannibal Lecter continue to chill our bones long after we had put the book down. There were times I almost forgot I was even reading a nonfiction book, as in these moments Larson's novel read more like something we'd expect to find in the horror section.Which is why if you were to ask me what my least-favorite thing about this book was, I would immediately answer, \"Erik Larson's writing style!\"Bet you didn't see that coming, eh? That was a twist right out of an M. Night Shyamalan movie!(This clip is from \"Robot Chicken\" and led to \"What A Twist\" becoming a running joke on the show. If you already knew that, you are officially as cool as me. Whether you take that as a compliment or a reason to start sobbing is completely up to you!)While Larson's writing during the Holmes segments was undeniably gripping, I felt he went a little overboard with his speculative approach. He describes what was going through the victims' heads moments before Holmes murdered them, things Larson has no way of knowing were actually true. This did take me out of the book quite a few times, as when I'm reading nonfiction and the author keeps adding details that can't actually be confirmed, it make me begin to wonder how true this true crime novel really is!I did enjoy reading \"Devil in the White City\", although I would say it's more a book for history enthusiasts than true crime fans, as the 1893 World's Fair is clearly the novel's main event, while Dr. Holmes is more of a sideshow freak. Whether you're here for the Fair or the murder castle, Erik Larson's skills as a writer makes this an interesting read, as long as you don't mind getting somechocolate in your peanut butterspeculative fiction in your true crime.(2-and-a-half-hours of fighting over chocolate in peanut butter... still a better movie than \"Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice\"!)"

        "user_review": "REVIEW VANISHED! Noticed Feb 17, 2022. 🤬REPOSTED: Feb 28, 2022\"Beneath the gore and smoke and loam, this book is about the evanescence of life, and why some men choose to fill their brief allotment of time engaging the impossible, others in the manufacture of sorrow. In the end it is a story of the ineluctable conflict between good and evil, daylight and darkness, the White City and the Black.\" Erik LarsonParis welcomed the world to its \"Exposition Universelle\" in 1889. It opened its doors to the world's fair and had as it's showstopper the Eiffel Tower. It seemed that France declared to all who saw the tower that they had overtaken the United States as the glorious leader in metalworks. The gauntlet had been thrown and American pride was at stake. When it was determined that America would hold a world's fair to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the \"new world\" by Columbus, Chicago won out over other major cities in contention for the right to host the event. The entire city worked as one to will the decision in its favor. From the moment in June 1889 that Chicago was granted the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, it had but a few scant months to organize location, financing, architects, engineers, tradespeople, exhibit collections, supplies, laborers, etc. and will the construction of a fair in all its magnanimity and splendor to be open on May 1,1893. Of course, it was understood that Chicago would have its own showstopper, but what it would be was yet to be invented! The World Columbian Exposition of 1893 was very significant in the development of many of the products/creations still in use today.This organized chaos provided the backdrop for THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY: MURDER, MAGIC, AND MADNESS AT THE FAIR THAT CHANGED AMERICA. The story is the juxtaposition of good and evil: the Gilded Age vs the Panic of 1893; the \"White City\" of the fair vs the \"Black City\" of Chicago; and, Daniel Burnham, lead architect of the exposition project vs H H Holmes, prolific serial killer – both blue-eyed, handsome, and skillful in their chosen professions.H H Holmes was also an \"architect\" of sorts visualizing and having built a hotel meeting his unique specifications. His hotel would be for those travelers arriving to experience the fair; and, if a traveler happened to be a young woman, so much the better. \"I was born with the devil in me,' [Holmes] wrote. 'I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.\"Chicago's world fair was a divining rod for the prolific ingenuity physically displayed by its white opulence and grandeur, hence \"The White City, while \"The Black City\" was a reflection of the real struggle of the common man in Chicago displayed by destitution, violence, and wickedness surrounding the fair. For all the many good things that the Exposition had in its favor, time, the Chicago winters, economic depression, bank failures, and resulting unemployment were all betting against the Exposition's success.The use of alternating the chapters between the main characters helped to drive the suspense and pulse of the story. It was riveting and definitely not boring. The amount of research put into this writing project is evident from the copious Notes at the end of the book. I definitely recommend this Erik Larson work of nonfiction and rate it 5 stars. Happy reading!!"

        "user_review": "in 1893, chicago took the world by storm when it hosted the world fair and created the marvel that was'the white city.'and the man behind it all was architect, daniel burnham. not far down the street from the fair grounds, there was another man by the name of dr. henry holmes who took advantage of those visiting the city by luring women to his hotel and killing them. he is considered americas first serial killer.so what do these two men have in common? other than being in the same city at the same time, absolutely nothing. although this book will try to convince you otherwise. there honestly isnt anything connecting the two, so i am confused as to why there is so much focus on them both in this. i can understand a book about the history and creation of the chicago world fair, and i also get writing a book about the crimes of dr. holmes, but putting the two together did not make any sense to me.while reading about the building and design of the fair was interesting, its very dense compared to how holmes' story is written. its almost like an information overload compared to the true crime chapters surrounding dr. holmes (which is what i was more interested in). it almost felt like the murders of dr. homes were just a fun little fact that was sprinkled throughout a history book about the 1893 world fair. so i think the synopsis and title are a little misleading with regard to the focus of this story.overall, this is quite an educational book. its not quite as entertaining as i thought it would be, but very informative nonetheless. the gilded age and importance of the world fair isnt something i knew much about, so it was neat to learn about it. although, i might try to find another book about dr. holmes, as this didnt quite satisfy my interest in him.↠3.5 stars"

        "user_review": "Heard the one about the architect and the serial killer? It's not a bad joke, but it is a great book. The architect was Daniel Burnham, the driving force behind the Chicago World's Fair of 1893; the killer was H.H. Holmes, a Svengali-type figure who lured young women to his hotel and did the most gruesome things, the least shocking of which was murder. The two men never met, but The Devil in the White City brings their stories together, and although it reads like a novel, everything is thoroughly researched fact.The bookThe Great Columbian Exhibition of 1893 was Chicago's big chance to shake off its old image as a hog-slaughtering, dirty and dangerous town and to take its place as America's second city. Although the fair's theme gave a backward nod to the 400th anniversary of Columbus bumping into the Americas on his way to India, its vision was futuristic: for the first time, electric lighting, clean water, and planned green spaces could be experienced on a massive scale. Innovations - the Ferris Wheel, the hamburger, an elevated railway, Juicy Fruit gum, the zip fastener and shredded wheat among them - enhanced the feeling that the next century would belong to America. The buildings were monumental, the exhibits eclectic (one example: a map of the USA made entirely of pickles) and the visitors were awestruck. They called it the White City, from the colour of main buildings that were imposing by day, dazzling by night.Much of this was down to Daniel Burnham. His can-do reputation for building skyscrapers made him a natural choice as project manager. But we're frequently reminded that he had to push himself to the limit and step on quite few toes to ensure the Fair's success, a job made all the more difficult by economic recession, bickering architects, striking workers, pompous politicians and Chicago's notorious weather.As if all this weren't enough to occupy the reader, a parallel story takes us inside the grim world of H.H. Holmes. Capitalising on the advent of the Fair, Holmes built his own hotel to attract single young women who were streaming into the city from across America in search of work, independence and a new life in the big city. One such unfortunate believed she was on the threshold of marriage to this enchanting gentleman; in reality, she was destined for a gas chamber in the hotel basement. She was not to be the last to fall for his charms, but even in death there was no rest. Holmes literally picked over the bones of his victims, selling their remains to medical students eager to examine recently deceased corpses - no questions asked. At first, the benefit for Holmes was financial, but as time passed, the chase, the kill, the post mortem had become ends in themselves. A single-minded detective and a stroke of luck brought Holmes to justice, but even when he realised the game was up, he managed to keep his unsettling cool.My thoughtsI had a strong feeling that I would take to this book, and from start to finish I was never disappointed. It fairly zings along, both stories proving absorbing, while casting out facts like frisbees.Although Burnham and Holmes are the book's dominant characters, there are walk-on parts for numerous figures who made their own mark on the White City. Buffalo Bill, Thomas Edison, and Scott Joplin are among the famous names, and the description of George Ferris's efforts to debut his eponymous wheel is a story in itself. But the lesser-known characters are also worthy of note. I pitied poor Frederick Olmsted's attempts to landscape the exhibition in the midst of an enormous, muddy construction site and a fit of depression. But I can see how ahead of his time he really was, insisting on natural greenery instead of a regimented collection of flower beds. Then there was Patrick Prendergast, whose descent into madness was to have a shocking impact on the Fair's final days; it's here that Larson's descriptive powers really come into their own.As for the serial killer, the author doesn't dwell on the sensationalist aspects of his more grisly activities, but what he leaves to the imagination is far more powerful. Extracts from letters written by a child kidnapped by Holmes are among the most upsetting words I've ever read - a reminder that the worst of human nature may not onlybe found in our own times.But my lasting impression from this book is one of optimism, of Burnham straining every nerve and sinew to achieve the impossible, and the ordinary folk of Chicago bursting with pride at what had been achieved.The U.S. edition of the book has the subtitle \"the fair that changed America\" - and that's certainly true, right down to the Pledge of Allegiance which can trace its origins to the exhibition's opening day. Beyond that, the Chicago Fair of 1893 not only showed America how it could be, but how it would be - better living and working conditions, convenience foods, domestic appliances, gadgets and more time for fun. In short, it heralded the prospect of a decent day's pay for a full day's work, a clean, safe environment, and of course the God-given right to eat shredded wheat.Who would like this book?I enjoyed it because of an interest in cities and architecture. But it would equally appeal to readers who are into engineering, politics, social history,horticulture, true crimes: does that leave anyone out?"

        "user_review": "I was genuinely excited to get back into this story every time I picked it up. At times, this jumble of factual events felt like a tale I would contrive while wandering aimlessly around Wikipedia (even thoughErik Larsonsays he did not get information from the internet because, apparently all, data found on the internet is questionable).Most of the dramatic facts this book will tell you show up near the top of the internet, and many are proclaimed at a bars when someone lets everyone know where Pabst won their blue ribbon and follows with, \"A young man by the name of George Farris went to that same fair in Chicago, 1893 — and he built himself a wheel.\"The best story and the reason why I wanted more was the story of Holmes, who murdered dozens while becoming America's first serial killer. I didn't really care for the ten plus pages describing where the fair would go and then what park in said city it would be in. Some of these details were distracting and took too long. As the reader, I just wanted to get to the gruesome parts.People like to say that non-fiction, \"reads like fiction,\" when they think it is good but that doesn't make much sense to me. Books without dialogue generally feel to me like Wikipedia, and they're good when I am able to stay interested."

        "user_review": "Even though I had reviewed this book on 11-21-2021, Goodreads was showing it as \"Want To Read\" on 12-10-2021. When I went to change it, my entire review, along with all of the lovely comments I had gotten, disappeared. Now I am reposting it.Erik Larson has taken on the role of an infomercial guy, in his 2003 book The Devil in the White City. Do you want to know the history of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893? That's great, BUT WAIT, there's more! Do you like reading about true crime and one of the first known serial killers in the U.S? That is even better, BUT WAIT, there's more! I'll throw in a side story about the nut case who murdered the mayor of Chicago.I found the history of the World's Fair to be the most interesting part of the book and felt it should have been a stand-alone story. Larson captures the zeitgeist of Chicago in the 1890s. The grand buildings were all painted white, giving the grounds the name of \"The White City.\" The fair development and building were bogged down with bureaucracy, bad weather, union strikes, worker injuries, a short time frame to complete, and some poor structural designs. The people involved included the famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and Walt Disney's father. Under the guidance of architect Daniel Burnham, the fair ended without losing money during a terrible economic time. The names that are dropped during the story were a who's who of the American elite. Visitors included Nikola Tesla, President Benjamin Harrison, and Frank Lloyd White. Buffalo Bill set up his famous Wild West Show starring Annie Oakley just outside the fairgrounds. The 1893 World's Fair introduced us to the Ferris Wheel, the tallest skyscrapers, grounds lighted by incandescent bulbs, and shredded wheat.The story involving \"The Devil\", H. H. Holmes was mostly interesting as Larson details the criminal activities of a charming serial killer who killed numerous people at the time of the fair. The smaller story regarding the crazy Pendergrast seemed unnecessary to the book. The intermixing of the true-crime tales with the history of the fair was a bit odd but mostly worked.3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 because of Larson's excellent story-telling ability."

        "user_review": "Extremely well written and researched, unsettling, entertaining, educational and fascinating are all words that come to mind on finishing Eric Larson's bookThe Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed AmericaThe Chicago World's Fair of 1893 was a remarkable achievement for the city of Chicago and it's architect Daniel H. Burnham and while the city was celebrating and enjoying this new wonder of the world, another man by the name of H.H. Holmes, a handsome and charming doctor was luring victims to their deaths and becoming America's first Serial Killer. This is the incredible true account of two very different men and the different paths their lives would lead them.This is my second Book by Eric Larson having read and lovedDead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitaniapreviously I was looking forward to another book by this author. His books are extremely well researched and very detailed and he leaves no stone unturned when telling a story.I loved learning about the Fair and the magnificent buildings, The World's first Ferris Wheel, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, electric boats, all the different elements that went into planning and organising such an amazing event. I loved how this book crossed over with numerous other books I had read about this time, (especially the quote from the notorious Chicago May who was born in Ireland only a few miles from my home and ended up becoming one of Chicago's most notorious Crooks of that time) I enjoyed the descriptions of families travelling long distances to the fair from small farms and towns and their amazement at witnessing these spectacular attractions and miracle of electricity for the first time. Eric Larson's descriptions are vivid and captivating and you actually imagine you are there at the centre of the city's excitement. Of course then you are brought back to reality with the murder and mayhem created by H.H Holmes and wonder how a man like this could have murdered so many innocent people and nobody noticed or suspected him.A word of warningThe Devil is in the detailand Eric Larson book's are high on detail and facts which I loved but some may find a tad tedious as the story does drag slightly in places but the historical information and descriptions are excellent and I loved every minute spent with this book.I listened to this one on audio and the narration was excellent."

Even Helen Keller made an appearance at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair! Alternating chapters educate the reader about the enormous undertaking and time constraints of building\"The White City\"combined with the daily bloodthirsty activities of serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett aka Dr. H. H. Holmes.Reading about B. H. Burnham's construction of the fair during a time of deadly diseases, grotesque environmental conditions and bank failures was certainly enlightening, but most intriguing for me was erection of the monstrous \"Ferris\" Wheel with enclosed glassed-in seats.(googled some amazing photos)Andthis dude Dr. HHH.....Picture a young, handsome prosperous man with mesmerizing big blue eyes who is in fact an evil psychopath, sniveling cheat and conniving polygamist. This devil incarnate killed on a whim and caused turmoil in so many families with his slithering knack of preying on the weak and vulnerable; and while I wasn't too surprised at the naivety of the young women, the men falling for his sleazy schemesreallyshocked me.This work of non-fiction is jam-packed with interesting facts, faces and descriptive details that are too numerous to even begin to mention here, but now, whenever I see Cracker Jack, I'll sure remember where it originated."

        "user_review": "The White City is the Chicago Columbia Exposition, a world fair in which all the buildings were painted white; the time the late 1800s during the fair; the Devil is a serial killer. Yet this is a non-fiction book. Larson has written a very informative as well as entertaining story. The Columbian Exposition was a very big deal. Chicago had vied for the honor of presenting a world's fair, and when they were selected the energy of the famed slaughterhouse city was put to the wheel. There are many personalities involved, not least Daniel Burnham, one of the top architects of his day and the coordinator of the entire project design. He brought in Frederick Law Olmstead and many other top architects. Chicago was determined to outdo the French, whose world fair in Paris had been a triumph, introducing, among other things, the Eiffel Tower, and mass use of alternating current. Larson describes the conflicting and outlandish personalities of the time, and makes us marvel that the thing ever actually got done. The Chicago Exposition introduced some significant items of its own, not least of which was a very progressive notion of city planning, for the enterprise required attention to a multitude of facets simultaneously in order to come to fruition. One of the structures built was then the largest building in the world. The fair introduced Mister Ferris' first working wheel. The Disney family attended and the fair may have inspired Walt to a development of his own. Buffalo Bill made millions with his entertainment just outside the fair gates (The fair had not allowed him to be a part of the show inside). Weather was a formidable opponent to the construction, as was the state of the economy, namely plummeting.Counterbalancing the travails and triumphs of creating the fair, the Devil of the title was a young man named Holmes (no, not Sherlock). He had a very winning way with people, particularly creditors and attractive young women. He had some flaws however. Among them was a complete inability to empathize with anyone. He was an extreme example of what we refer to today as a psychopath. He set up shop in Chicago about that time, acquired some property and constructed on it a building of his own design. It was called The Castle, and one might be forgiven for imagining it with lightning bolts blasting stormy skies. For it was here that he murdered untold numbers of people, women, men, children. He designed the building to incorporate a space in which he could trap and gas people. He also allowed for his need to incinerate the bodies without releasing much aroma. His charm kept the suspicious at bay. Eventually, of course, he was found out and brought to justice, but not until he had slain somewhere between 50 and 200 people.Larson peppers the book with dozens of satisfying factoids, about the people he is describing and about the times. It was, despite some of the darker subject matter, a very engaging, informative, and yes, fun read."

        "user_review": "The Devil in The White City is a fascinating study of the genius of two men and how they applied that genius. At first I was worried that the book would be too gory but most of the details are left to the imagination.However, the Fair is what captivated me. How these men managed to build such beauty and excitement with limited time, funds and a less than favorable location, is amazing. I live in Milwaukee, about a hour and a half from Chicago and I know this area well, that brought it home to me a lot. The descriptive writing painted a picture of the dazzling buildings as well as the many famous visitors. The Ferris Wheel was such an engineering feat that it's hard to believe that it all worked, sustaining the incredible weight of the cars and the people. The writing is absolutely superb and I could not put this book down. Afterward I spent many hours on the internet searching for photographs from the fair and was amazed to view it, it was even more spectacular than I had imagined. Strangely the Chicago Museum has very little on the Fair and the development of the Ferris Wheel.There was so much to learn from this book about this time period when Chicago struggled to prove itself and it did! As described in the book I'm sure it was depressing to see the fair end and go back to a regular life, particularly during those economically distressed time. The killings and plotting of H. Holmes were a tremendous shock to the 1800's society. I shiver to think how callous we have now become to such crimes.I will highly recommend this book to everyone who loves great writing and particularly to lovers of historical fiction."

I've read a lot of other reviews for this book and people seem to really hate the fact that this book isn't just about H.H.Holmes. A lot of the reviewers apparently never read the back of the book or they would have known that its a split biography. The Devil in the White City is obviously about H. H.Holmes but its also about the 1893 Worlds Fair which was held in Chicago.For me The Worlds Fair was the most fascinating part. Maybe that's because I went in knowing about Dr. Holmes but the fair was completely new to me. I had to fight the urge to Google people and places while I read because I really wanted more information.Here are a few things the 1893 Worlds Fair introduced:The Ferris Wheel, Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, Aunt Jemima boxed pancakes, and juicy fruit gum.For me this book lived up to the hype. Erik Larson paints a vivid and engrossing picture of the rise of Chicago and the first known American Serial Killer. If you enjoy books about True Crime or if you just enjoy a good History book then I highly recommend this book."

This was history made accessible but almost too accessible and readable to the detriment of depth and perhaps some additional analysis.This is a book that ties together (rather loosely) the development and execution of the Chicago World Fair in the 1890s and a sociopathic doctor serial-killer. The stories were not treated equally and at times the emphasis on the design and development of the architecture of the fair overshadowed the story of the doctor who was at times presented as an after-thought.To Mr. Larson's credit he took a wealth of information and presented it in an easily understandable style that read like a very long and pretty good Vanity Fair article. I, however, as a reader was not wholly satisfied and the two stories were not treated equally and sometimes the connections seemed rather loose and haphazard.All in all, though, I enjoyed this book and will read further books by Mr. Larson."

The only thing that was missing for me would have been some kind of map to show where exactly the Fair was located, and all the other buildings he talks about... I think the fair was probably located roughly on what the Museum Campus is now, but I still would like to see a map.And the people! Burnham and Root and Atwood... and Carter Henry Harrison! It says his mansion was on Ashland, I'm wondering exactly where. And Mudgett... I wonder where all of his buildings were... it sends chills up my spine just to think about it. I wonder if anyone has put together a tourist's map based on this book?O.K., beyond my personal reasons for being fascinated, the writing is excellent, and really well documented. And the charming thing is that he documented everything in the back of the book in a really simple way, so if you were so inclined you would not have to be a big fancy scholar to follow his paper trail and see all of this stuff for yourself. Power to the people!And the writing style is accessible and the voice is also very appropriate... he kind of veers between eulogist and undertaker. And the few times that he takes liberties and describes things that no one could ever really possibly have documented, he does so in a way that is careful and responsible. And I think for him not to have taken the liberties would have been a mistake... I think everyone who read the book would have thought there was something missing.And what's ultimately really rewarding about this book is that the author outlines all the ways in which the influences of Fair of 1893 reverberated in American culture (and the world) for years afterward. Our aesthetic sensibility as a nation was permanently changed. And our technological sensibility. And to think that all of this was planned so fast, it was like a supernova in the middle of this underdeveloped backwater (oh, I said it. I live here now, and sometimes I still think of Chicago that way.). And that with all that progress comes this darkness, too, there's this underside to everything.And with that lovely thought, I'm going to try and find the Wooded Island. Ciao!"

        "user_review": "This was my first time reading a book by author Erik Larson, so I didn't know what to expect.He told two stories. One was a historical narrative from the perspective of Daniel H. Burnham who was the Director of Works and had the daunting challenge of constructing the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in a little over two years time.The other story was a true crime narrative about Herman W. Mudgett who was better known by one of his many aliases, H. H. Holmes. Holmes was an unknown psychopathic serial killer who owned a pharmacy and hotel near the fair site.Larson's superb writing skills intertwined these two stories to create a masterful portrayal of the events in that time. My only disappointment was the lack of pictures that would have even better enhanced my reading pleasure."

        "user_review": "The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America by Erik Larson is a 2003 publication.Astounding!I recently read a review of this book online, which reminded me that I had a copy of it on my bookshelf. I was sure I had already read this book- albeit a long time ago- but I had not added it to any of my online book sites, which prompted an internal debate with myself – did I- or did I not read this book or did I maybe have it confused with another book I'd read about H.H. Holmes?As it turns out, I had read it- but it was so long ago many of the details had faded from my memory. Since I had not added the book to any of my online book sites, and I wanted to get a review up for it, I decided a refresher was in order.To be clear, this is a true crime book about H. H. Holmes, but it's much more that- it's also about a time, a place, a huge event in history, and those who brought it all together. It's a horrifying story, but also a fascinating one.Larson is quite something, isn't he? The research is, of course, phenomenal, but it's the way he makes history come to life that kept me turning those pages.The book reads like a novel, which, as we know, is an approach many True Crime authors have mastered, but is a bit harder to pull off when writing about history. Anyone who feels history or nonfiction is too dry should give this book a try!Larson had me in the palm of his hand and despite my penchant for True Crime, it was the planning and execution of the magnificent World Fair that takes center stage. The architecture, all the vivid details, the people behind the scenes, and the influx of people into the city was just incredible.But evil was lurking in the background and the fair turned out to be the perfect environment for a serial killer- H. H. Holmes- to be exact.Holmes was most assuredly the stuff nightmares are made of!! He got away with so much, for such a long time, it was hard to take it all in!! Times were so different back then too- which made it easier for Holmes to con a more trusting public.Overall, Larson has a unique approach, and a well organized presentation, bringing together two seemingly different subjects, and linking them together in such a way that one can hardly tear themselves away from the pages.That's a rare talent for historical writing. I highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys true crime and history, of course, but even if you usually prefer fiction, you'll probably still find this book of great interest!!4.5 stars"

        "user_review": "Always one to enjoy a little true crime, I had this book highly recommended to me by a very close friend. Erik Larson explores not only the electric sentiment surrounding the World's Fair in Chicago, but also a sinister character hiding in the shadows, piling up a number of bodies while no one took much notice. The year is 1890 and Chicago is vying to win the right to host the World's Fair. Set to take place in 1893, the fair has been promised to the United States, allowing a proper quadricentennial celebration of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World. After a gruelling vote by Congress, Chicago won the bid and preparations began. Headed by Daniel H. Burnham, the 'World's Columbian Exposition' started its planning stages, seeking the best land, the greatest buildings, and the most elaborate set-up possible to impress the world. With a limited timetable, everything had to move at lightning speed, something that Burnham would soon realise turned out to be a snail's pace. In the background, one Herman W. Mudgett, who goes by H. H. Holmes, arrived in the area and settled in Chicago. Professing a medical background, Holmes sought to invest in local businesses and lay down some roots. His innovative ideas caught the attention of many, which was paired with his magnetic personality. However, deep within him lurked a man who was infused with the devil's own magic, or so he believed. Larson discusses early in the book about how Holmes laid the groundwork for numerous cases of insurance fraud, having people obtain life insurance policies and name him (sometimes using more pseudonyms) as the sole beneficiary. Holmes was also known to use his eyes of the deepest blue to lock onto a woman and decide how he might have her as his own. Larson offers up a wonderful narrative as to how Holmes subtlety lured a certain young woman away from her husband, all while having the man invest deeper into a business venture. Once the woman had left her husband, he courted her and promised all the riches he could offer. He let nothing stand in his way, even a pregnancy that he sought to abort, removing all hurdles to his plans. Holmes brought the woman to his suite on Christmas Eve and killed her, though never allowed a single drop of blood to flow from her, thereby hiding much of the forensic evidence. A killer was born, at least in Chicago, though through some fast talking, Holmes convinced everyone that the victim had left to visit family, while selling her body to a local medical school once it had been disarticulated.With the fair set to open before too long, Burnham had yet to find his piece de resistance; something that would rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris from the fair not five years before. After a number of options proved too underwhelming and M. Eiffel's attempt to create something new seemed to be a slap in the face, Burnham accepted an idea by a Mr. Ferris to create a massive wheel that would allow fair-goers to see the grounds and much of Chicago from a contained pod. With all the other preparations, Burnham left Ferris to create his masterpiece, hoping that it would be ready for the May 1,1893 opening. He set about making sure everything was running smoothly, while also being feted in the most extravagant ways (Larson includes the menus, which had my mouth watering). By the time the World's Columbian Exposition opened, the Ferris Wheel was well behind schedule and fair-goers could only gawk at it, hoping that it might be up and running before too long. Burnham seethed in the background, as gate admissions proved to be troubling and the bankers were ready to call in their debts. Meanwhile, Holmes found a new woman to woo, choosing to present himself with a pseudonym so that no one would get suspicious. His plans grew as he had her help him prepare his hotel for the fair-goers, but would wait for things to really kick off before disappearing with more bodies attributable to his sinister work. Holmes surely had a taste for death, though his was far less gruesome than Jack the Ripper, the latest serial killer whose name had been splashed all across the tabloids only a few years before.In the culminating section of the book, Erik Larson offers the reader a glimpse not only into the wonders that the fair brought, but the intensity of Holmes and his killing spree. While the world was introduced to Juicy Fruit chewing gum, they were oblivious to the missing women who fell at the hands of a folded cloth of chloroform. Aunt Jemima instant pancake mix might have wooed households (more so than the new cereal, Shredded Wheat), Cracker Jacks offered up a new and sweet popcorn-based snack, and new technologies for communication and inter-personal socialisation. All the while, H. H. Holmes plotted horrible ways by which he could kill and feed his ever-growing need for power. In an interesting parallel, while the end of the exposition came, Holmes was also seeking to pack up and depart Chicago. Larson discusses some of the macabre events that saw the end of the exposition look blacker than Chicago had hoped. Holmes' departure brought him to the attention of the authorities and a massive insurance fraud opened the door to some questions about the whereabouts of some who had gone missing. Larson shows how quickly things went from calm to chaotic and what led authorities to capture a serial killer no one even knew existed. A piece that will surely stay with me for years to come, as I make sure to find more books by Erik Larson to feed my appetite for this sort of writing. Recommended to those who love a chilling piece of true crime, as well as the reader whose love of history and late 19th century America remains high.Erik Larson offers readers a sensational piece of true crime, though it is so much more. His subtle telling of the murders committed by H. H. Holmes proves to add to the eerie nature of the entire experience, as he layers the narrative with the development and launching of the World's Columbian Exposition. Featuring so much detail in the slow and methodical planning of the event, Larson pulls the reader into the middle of it all, as though they were there with Daniel H. Burnham through trial and tribulation. Equally as stunning is the means by which Larson told of the plotting Holmes undertook for each of his victims, making sure to fit himself into the community and win over the hearts of neighbours before causing the odd (and intricate) disappearance. Larson could not have added more detail, as it truly feels to the reader as though they are right there, down to the 'large ice fangs that covered the trains one January night as the engines travelled along the tracks'. It is this depiction that turns this from a book of true crime to one in which the reader can almost sense what is lurking in the shadows. Some may wish to bolt their doors, others might not want to go out after dark, and still others may be left wondering about their neighbours and acquaintances, such is the depth to which Larson makes the reader feel a part of the action. The book is broken into four parts, with vignettes that serve as chapters. Larson balances the narrative between the exposition and Holmes' activities advancing both as the timeline requires. This is surely one of those books that will keep the reader wondering what to expect, especially those who are not familiar with the murders. With so much to see and do throughout the book, the reader is sure to get lost amongst all the action and the numerous characters. Erik Larson does his best to keep it straight and provides the reader with the ride of their life... and I am not even referring to the Ferris Wheel.Kudos, Mr. Larson, for a sensational depiction of a period of time meant to be celebratory, with a definite pall of darkness clouding over it. I will be checking out more of your work to see what else I might learn.Love/hate the review?

        "user_review": "Ferris wheels, Cracker Jacks, Buffalo Bill and a serial killer!As Chicago entered the final decade of the 19th century, it was a black city with a black heart, a figurative and literal pig sty run by a civil administration rife with graft and dominated by the stink of the pig slaughtering industry that was run by the local equivalent of capitalist robber barons. In a shocking affront to New York City's insufferable sense of superiority, Chicago's city fathers somehow won the right to host the 1893 World Fair. Despite the astonishing crime rates, the filth, the brothels, the sewage, the dirt, the overwhelming stench of the local pork packing factories and the noise and smoke of railways right in the center of the city, they were determined to prove to themselves, to a spiteful and jealous New York, to the USA and, indeed, to the world that they were a modern city, that they could put together an exposition of architectural beauty and technological marvels that could best the recent bravura performance in Paris that showcased the astonishing Eiffel Tower.THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITYis, in fact, two stories. The first is the story of the Herculean efforts and undoubted success of architect, Daniel H Burnham, in designing and creating the 1893 Columbian Exposition, a World's Fair that did indeed meet and exceed every expectation and lofty dream that even the most hopeful of Chicago's citizens might have envisioned. Unlike so many authors of non-fiction material, Erik Larson has put together a story that reads like a novel. We learn that the 1893 World's Fair hosted the unveiling of such myriad US innovations as Cracker Jacks, the Ferris wheel and shredded wheat. The engineers and architects responsible for building the fair were also instrumental in leading the USA to the choice of an electrical system based on AC current. We witness dignitaries and leaders from around the world have their breath taken away as they attend a fair that indeed showcases the US entry into the technology of the 20th century. Appearances from the likes of Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley make Larson's exciting story even more colourful.The second story is one of black, sinister evil that, at least in a metaphorical sense, contrasts with the uniform blinding white exterior of the magnificent structures that graced the grounds of the fair. Dr H.H. Holmes, born Herman Webster Mudgett, arguably the first documented American serial killer, opened a hotel very close to the fair. \"Hotel\" is a very charitable description of the building. In fact, it was a killing ground, a house of horrors equipped with a crematorium, gas chambers, surgical dissection tables, air tight vaults to torture and suffocate his victims. While the official count says that the charismatic and multiply bigamous Holmes was responsible for 27 murders, some estimates run as high as 200.From the point of view of creating an amazing story, Larson's decision to juxtapose two such different topics was brilliant - black and white, the magic and beauty of the fair contrasted with the evil and horror of a killer, light versus dark and hope versus despair. The story of Holmes' astonishing ability to get away with so much for so long is even an interesting contrast against the ultimate dogged pursuit of the evidence that would ultimately convict him.One of the editorial reviews of this books says:\"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that The Devil in the White City is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel.\"Indeed, I read another review which made it quite clear that the author of the review had indeed suffered from this misunderstanding. The point is, of course, that Erik Larson has done his work that well. Interesting, informative and exciting,THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITYis a thoroughly enjoyable read. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

        "user_review": "Erik Larson is an amazing historical writer -- one of those rare breed who can bring the past to life and make it seem immediate, fresh, intimate and amazing. The book is based on fact, but it reads like the best of novels, going back and forth between the team racing to put together the most important peacetime event in U.S. history, and a psychopathic murderer who is stalking the city at the same time, preying on young women with a cold efficiency that makes Jack the Ripper look like (excuse the pun) a hack. I had no particular interest in the Chicago World's Fair, but Larson is a teacher who can make you forget you are learning. Anywhere he chooses to take you, you can be assured the ride is worth the price of admission."

        "user_review": "This book is a hard book to put down because the entire time you're seeking answers. Why? What actually happened? What made it progress to this? Things like that. Things that people asked after Columbine, most recently after Virginia Tech, and after all the other school shootings. Once again Jodi Picoult tackles a sensitive and controversial issue, in an amazingly strong and dignified manner that doesn't have you choosing sides.She did it to the reader inMy Sister's Keeper, where the minute you began to go to one side, she presents something where you're suddenly seeing it all from a different angle. Every time you begin to thing Peter was in the right, an angry and upset parent stands up and says something to make you think again. A writer who can play devil's advocate to her own characters is a gifted writer indeed.Nineteen Minutesends with stunning results. We think we know exactly what happened, but as the story progresses and we delve deeper into various characters psyche we begin to realize everything is not what it seems. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you're like me you'll begin to suspect things earlier on. In the end the book will leave you with a feeling of sad hope, a feeling I never knew existed until I finished this book.I'd say more, but as with other books I've reviewed, sometimes I just have to let the book speak for itself. It's such an amazingly sensitive story, to critique it too much might skew your own opinion going into it. The writing is beautiful, the characters complex and real. That's all I'm going to say, I think you need to find the rest out for yourself."

        "user_review": "I have read most of Jodi Picoult's books, and they are always entertaining and easy to read. However, this one was definitely not my favorite, and I often found it a bit formulaic and poorly executed. Maybe it's because I HAVE read so many of her books that I was looking for her signature \"twist\" at the ending (which an astute reader will guess at halfway through the book, if not earlier), and her characters seem to act in certain ways that are not fitting.***Spoilers Follow***************************************************************SPOILERS BELOWThe book is centered around a high-school shooting, the culprit a teenage boy named Peter Houghton, who to my mind is not a very convincing villain. The reader is supposed to empathize with Peter from the time he's a baby - this supposed \"monster\" is shown as a tender, loving boy who gets picked on mercilessly at school. The point, really, is to show that even the most sensitive, nice child can be turned into a killer when he is bullied relentlessly. But I still never really saw Peter, as he is portrayed in the flashbacks, as the same kid who was purported to have killed ten of his classmates in a murderous rampage.Another loose end that never seems to get tied up is Peter's questioning of his sexuality. In one chapter, Peter is going to a gay bar and a GLAAD meeting, thinking he likes men. He is sitting next to Josie, another main character, and thinking that although she's pretty, he feels nothing for her. Fast forward fifty pages, and he's sending Josie a lovesick email about how much he wants to be a \"couple\" with her. The point of this, ostensibly, is to show that because the bullies tormented Peter with cries of \"homo\", that caused him to even question his own sexuality. But the email to Josie just seemed to be a convenient, and very out-of-character, move to tie plot points together.The most baffling of all, and the hardest to accept, is the infamous Picoult plot twist which is set up through the whole book, via a \"second gun\" with only a partial fingerprint, that seems to have been fired but nobody can find the bullet, and it's lying on the floor in the room with Josie, her dead boyfriend, and the shooter. Glimpses of a quasi-abusive relationship between Josie and her jock boyfriend surface, and then the bombshell - JOSIE shot the boyfriend! And THEN Peter shot him too! Despite the fact that Josie loved him. Or hated him. Despite the fact that Josie has shown no inclination toward homicide, and happens to be standing face-to-face with the boy who has just slaughtered all of her friends. Does this seem believable to anyone? Again, it's ostensibly because Josie doesn't see another way out of this relationship - the jock boyfriend has threatened to kill himself if she ever leaves him. But shooting him in the gut? That's a bit overwrought and hard to swallow.I write this review as a loyal fan of Jodi Picoult's work, and an ardent fan of books like \"The Pact\" and \"My Sister's Keeper\". I just wish Picoult would step out of the box a little bit and shake things up - just like moviegoers are starting to tire of M. Night Shyamalan's plot twists and wacked-out endings, so I'm beginning to be unsurprised and underwhelmed by Picoult's work."

What a thought provoking, absorbing listen!!While I'm 12 years late, it was great to finally get around to this incredible read, no matter how difficult the subject matter, and unfortunately, still so relevant today.I chose the audiobook format and found it very hard to hit the \"pause\" button.It was impossible for me to not to fall in love with some characters and feel utter hate for the actions of others.I am purposely being vague about the storyline, as I cannot encourage you enough to go in totally blind for the most powerful and surprising effect.This is definitely one I will never forget!It had been way too long since I was entertained by Jodi Picoult and will check my local library's inventory for more of this author's audiobooks.Extremely well written and narrated!"

        "user_review": "Believe it or not, I have never actually read one of Jodi Piccoult's books before. I'm not really sure why, but I haven't.This particular book has really stayed with me as I finished it, and I think Piccoult makes a few very important points/observations.1. Sometimes the perpetrator of a heinous crime is the biggest victim of them all. Reading the things that Peter went through sometimes brought me to tears. I have never understood how people can treat others so badly, and the behavior of the bullies in this story was beyond the pale. It was easy to see how he could have been driven to do what he did, even though it was absolutely horrific.2. High school is hard. I think most of us can look back on our high school days and remember struggling to fit in, remember the cruelty of some kids, and remember thinking that being \"popular\" meant you'd made it in life. Now, with my adult perspective, I can see how silly much of it was, but I remember that it was very real to me. I wasn't popular, but I did find my niche. I went through my share of teasing, and in the end I think it made me a stronger person, however I never endured anything like what Peter had to endure and I wonder how I would have gotten through something like that.3. Nobody can judge a situation perfectly equitably. Not even a superior court judge. The storyline of Alex and her daughter showed that quite well, but so did the stories of most of the characters. You can't judge only on face value, or even on actions only. Piccoult did an excellent job of playing Devil's advocate for every single character...so much so, that it is difficult to make up your mind one way or the other.4. Schools may have a zero tolerance policy for bullying, but in reality, they turn a blind eye to much of it. I have experienced this a bit with Bria's schools. I think it is impossible for the teachers and administration to really see what is going on all the time, but I do think that they need to be more aware of who is the bully and who is the victim. It was very sad and even gut wrenching to see how the teachers either didn't want to deal with Peter's situation, half heartedly dealt with it, encouraged it, or punished him right along with the bully. I don't really know what the answer is, but it seems to me there's got to be something better.5. Peter's crime shouldn't be blamed on his parents, but they aren't guilt free, either. We can see that Peter's parents did what they thought was best, and they loved him. However, from the time he was born, they constantly compared him to his older brother, who was seemingly perfect. It got to a point that Peter couldn't confide in them about the hurt he was experiencing, because they always asked why he couldn't just be like Joey. And then to have Joey killed tragically a year before Peter's shooting spree didn't help. Both parents eventually admitted to themselves that they would have rather had Peter been killed in the car accident instead of Joey. Wow. I am pretty sure that kind of an attitude is evident to children, no matter how hard you try to hide it. Other mistakes these parents made were writing off Peter's anti social behaviors for normal teenage boy actions, and not really trying to have a relationship with him. Allowing him his privacy, instead of finding out what he was up to and what was going on in his life in a way that showed they truly were interested about him and truly cared. They seemed to be the poster children for loving, but lazy, parenting. (Which really isn't loving, actually).Likewise, Alex had issues being a mother, and it took a tragic event to help her to reevaluate her priorities and her actions as Josie's mother. I was happy she recognized her mistakes and worked to be better, but still, much of the damage had already been done. At least it wasn't as bad of a situation as Peter's parents were in, where the damage had all been done and there was no repairing any of it.6. Ultimately, it doesn't matter what the mitigating circumstances are. The law is still the law. Alex dealt with this early in her career as a judge...not agreeing with some laws but still having to uphold them legally (gun control). And of course, Peter and Josie needed to pay for their actions. That is the law. I don't think it could be any different, and of course, I don't excuse Peter for what he did. As the trial showed, there were other kids who were bullied just as much who didn't decide to shoot up the school.There are so many other things I could say about this book. Piccoult is obviously very good at bringing up hot button societal issues and presenting them in a way that makes you really think. I am excited to read more of her novels.A few silly annoyances (because I always have them):1. One of the first times we meet Judge Alex Cormier is when she is pregnant with Josie and she fills out a form with her name: Alexandra Cormier. Later in the book it talks about how her name isn't short for Alexandra like people assume. Well then, why would she fill out paperwork like that?2. People are constantly \"pinching the bridge of their noses\" in exasperation. I swear I read that phrase more than 5 times.3. I didn't feel the twist at the end was sufficiently explained. Maybe the abusive relationship she sort of showed between Matt and Josie explains it. She foreshadowed a bit that something big was up, but I didn't feel that what Josie ultimately did made a ton of sense in the situation. Perhaps a bit more backstory on the relationship, or at the very least, on Josie's feelings about the relationship, would have made more sense to me. As it was, I felt it was a bit out of place. Definitely twisty, though. So if that's what Piccoult was going for, then great."

        "user_review": "When I read this book a few years ago, I had already gotten through four other Jodi Picoult -My Sister's Keeper,The Tenth Circle,Vanishing Acts, andThe Plain Truth, in case anyone cares. I feel that we had a good relationship. Sure, after the first exciting fling things got predictable pretty fast (\"gee, I wonder ifthisone will have dramatic courtroom scenes?\"), but Jodi was still able to keep me hooked. Then I readNineteen Minutes, and decided it was time to call it off.One big problem with the book is that I was expected to think - or at least consider - that a kid being bullied for years is an excuse to shoot up a high school, killing not only the cliche popular jerks but also several innocent bystanders. No. I'm sorry, no.It didn't help that the bullied kid in question was utterly unlikable, as was his tragic friend with the abusive jock asshole boyfriend - every high school-related convention and cliche is used and run into the goddamned ground here, and it is unpleasant.But here's the real reason the book gets one star, and I don't consider this a spoiler because I think people deserve to be warned about this: the morbid fascination of school shootings stems from, I believe, the mystery ofwhyany kid would go to such an extreme. Since most of the people who commit this crime end up killing themselves, we never really know how or if they justified their actions.With this in mind, pretend you're a writer working on a book about a school shooting, where the killer narrates some of the story. Wouldn't it be a good idea to have a chapter where the reader gets to be inside the killer's head during the actual shooting, so they could understand his thought process and logic?If you answered \"well, duh,\" then congratulations, you are not Jodi Picoult. Throughout the entire book, we never,everget to see the shooting through the bullied kid's eyes. Why did he shoot the people who never harmed him, including a teacher who was kind to him and some random girl just walking in his line of fire? Did he feel any remorse during the shooting? What was he thinking? Why did he stop in the middle of his spree to sit down in the cafeteria andeat a bowl of cereal? We never find out, and this infuriated me so much Picoult might as well have ended the book with, \"I'm Jodi Picoult and I get paid thousands of dollars to print out crap they sell in airport bookstores! I do what I want, so fuck you!\"Yeah, you know what? Fuckyou, Jodi. People are only buying your damn book so they can get into the killer's head in the exact way I've described, and you're just screwing with them. Not cool."

        "user_review": "When I initially started listening toNineteen Minuteson audiobook, I debated about whether I was going to continue because it is a fictional account of a mass shooting at a high school. The grim reality of mass shootings throughout the US at schools, malls, stores, churches, movie theaters, etc is disturbing, depressing, and seems to be never ending.I read several Goodreads reviews onNineteen Minutesand decided to continue listening to the audiobook. It is narrated superbly by Carol Monda. The plot and story arc are woven masterfully. The relationships between parents and teenagers show how small fractures can turn into chasms. Character development is outstanding. Bullying is a critical theme.The title is based on how many things can be done in a nineteen minute timeframe. Settle into this book, because it is over nineteen hours on audiobook but it is well worth the time."

        "user_review": "The creation of a mass murderer!Peter Houghton would hardly be considered a typical seventeen year old teenager. Because one morning, he loaded his backpack with four guns, went to school and killed nine students and a teacher. Jodi Picoult's enthralling best-selling novelNineteen Minutes, titled to portray the astonishingly brief period of time that Houghton took to complete his brutal spree, examines the genesis of that event and the people affected by it from every conceivable perspective - families, victims, survivors, witnesses, parents, friends, police and the law.Picoult expertly examines a myriad of issues - teenage angst; \"in\" crowds; drug use; bullying; teen sexuality; peer pressure; privacy; parenting - and creates a gripping fictionalized version of a tragic event that no thinking reader could possibly put down. At the end of this astonishing tale, many readers will actually feel sympathy for a convicted mass murderer. Certainly many also will not but, at the end of the day, all readers will realize that Picoult's amazing ability to present an issue from a wide variety of perspectives without herself being judgmental will at least give readers an understanding as to how such a horrific tragedy might come to pass!Many potential readers may have heard the criticism of the endings of Picoult's novels. Somewhat out of character and different in flavour than the entire novel that led up to it, the ending forNineteen Minutesis certainly not exempt from this criticism. While it is somewhat Hollywood in nature, it provides a twist ending that will snap the reader's eyelids wide open. Maybe it was a little too pat, maybe it wasn't ... but at the very least, it will provide a whole new layer of provocative thought that will keep the reader puzzling over the issues that Picoult raises for a long, long time after the last page closes.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

My sophomore year of high school, a classmate of mine gave a presentation on this book saying it was her favorite of all time, and ever since then I've been interested in what she loved so much about it. Books about school shootings have always intrigued me, but they're especially relevant today. I'm glad I read this book after I readA Mother's Reckoningbecause that gave such an insight to being in the critical spotlight as the mother of a school shooter and a lot of Sue's experiences were echoed in this book.My lasting impression of this book rests on two things:1. It reads kind of like an episode of law and order--just a little bit too cookie cutter and predictable in a way that reminds you that what you're reading/watching is fictional.2. This book is now a bit dated. This shooting in the book occurred in 2007, and the media and technology have evolved so much now that parts of this felt antiquated.This was still worth the read after owning it for 4+ years, but I can't say it's one of my new favorites."

Nineteen Minutes is a favorite among most people, so I had this one slated to read whenever I wanted a quick summer read.For the last 100 or so pages, I could hardly put it down. Her formula for keeping the reader engaged works very well.But I had some issues with this book that annoyed the hell out of me. Firstly, I have never come across so many stupid and needless analogies. Or are they similes? Whatever...Here are a few:This is from a funeral scene:Loud, noisy sobs - the kind that splattered against the walls of the church like paint.I wonder how long it took her to think that one up.Or this one:If you were uncertain in the decisions you made as a father, could you patch over your insecurities with the confidence you had as a professional? Or would the fix always be flimsy, a paper wall that couldn't bear weight?Or this Picasso:Bruises bloomed on her skin where he held her fast, as if she were a canvas and he was determined to leave his mark.How about this gem?and the way the stars were pricking at her skin, like inoculations for a terminal diseaseI could go on and on, but I'll stop with one more:In the upper right-hand corner were the lunch ladies, slopping food onto plastic trays as students came through the line one by one, like drops through an intravenous tube.Yes! Exactly like that!Ugh. You know, for the most part, this was a pretty solid read, formula-wise. But every time I came upon one of these ridiculous analogies, it took me out of the story and I'd think, why the hell was that needed??Okay, Let's do one more for the description of Alex's eyes:Hers were the pale gray that made you think of nightfall and silver bullets and the edge of winter.O-Kaay.This is a writer that is trying way too hard.Furthermore:The whole Josie thing was nothing more than a twist for the sake of a twist and did not ring true to me one bit.Oh, she loves him, no, she hates him, no, she loves him, no, she shoots him, no, she loves him again.And, how could Peter's attorney possibly think that a difference circumstance with his TENTH murder after his rampage would have a significant impact on his sentence? Give me a break. Really.Alright, so that's it for Jodi Picoult. See ya..."

        "user_review": "This is a powerful read. After an act of violence is perpetuated at the local high school, those 19 minutes change a New Hampshire town forever. The writing is riveting and poignant. We are reading about the events leading up to the climax. The history of the individuals involved. Their mindset. It's a lot to take in. Especially because the good aren't all good and the bad aren't all bad. I think as readers, it puts us in a unique and introspective position as we are not shown only the parts that are convenient. The big picture isn't simple either. It's messy. It's emotional. It's heartbreaking. There are no winners. It makes you think about the signs you are possibly not seeing. The things you are saying or not saying for that matter. It makes you think about things done to you or things you may have done to others. Although I predicted some of what turned out to be the twist in the story, I found myself utterly drawn in by the story. The characters were dynamic and complex. Layered very well. The plot dealt with a sensitive situation gracefully not taking short cuts and offering a well rounded perspective. The writing was just stellar. An absolute win. Safety: There is abuse and sex that doesn't always appear to be consensual. There is a lot of physical violence."

        "user_review": "This is what I have come to understand about Jodi Picoult. She takes a controversial or emotionally-charged topic. School shootings. Childhood leukemia. Amish people. Then she centers that topic around terribly cliched characters and cranks the schmaltz meter to 11. The novels alternate between characters' points of view so quickly that Picoult rivals most TV news stations in offering endless shallow ten-second bits of information. Each little section, offered at a rate that would overwhelm even the worst case of ADHD, ends with a cutesy phrase that is a thin attempt at instilling a flimsy motif. Then, near the end of the book, there's a surprise twist that I can only guess is meant to titillate the unsuspecting reader in the midst of their mindless revelry of such crappy writing. Of course, that little plot twist is so ridiculous, at least when offered at the rate that Picoult spews them up for the delight of her idiotic claque of bovine \"readers,\" that any central issue that once may have been considered almost sacrosanct is reduced to senseless drivel that makes for easy ridicule, as evidenced above.School shootings or bullying are topics that should not be mismanaged to the point of hilarity, and they certainly shouldn't be used by hack writers cashing in on the public's worst fears to make a few (thousand) bucks. Either that's the case here, or Picoult is just a terrible writer."

        "user_review": "I tend to rate books by how much they make me think, how much they make me feel, and how much they draw me into their world. With an almost obsessive interest in Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, Nineteen Minutes gets high marks from me. The book starts with the scene of a school shooting where you feel a disgust for the kid doing the shooting and sorrow for the victims but as you glean settings from flashbacks you come to sympathize with everyone in the book as a victim, each experiencing loss of different degrees. I can almost exactly correlate my feelings with the timeline of Columbine grief. In that sense the raw emotions were very real. But in the exaggerated small outcast boy, the popular snotty girls, the stupid cruel jocks, the overprotective parents, and all the other stereotypes I found myself resisting relating to the characters. Sometimes it felt very real, but occasionally it felt like statistics (especially with the random foreign last names).As your emotions are pulled to sympathize with one person then the next, you're left with the questions of who to blame, who to feel sorry for in the wake of a tragedy. For me I have a natural tendency to defend the underdog, to want to understand what put the perpetrator over the edge, while still reserving a small amount of accountability for them. It was obvious that Picoult seems to share the same allegiance to the bullied, but I would have liked to hear a little more about the stories of those who were shot and understand their motivations. I wanted to feel just as ashamed and saddened for them instead of focusing on aligning emotions with the ones the newscasters want to blame. I enjoyed the forum of different voices in the stories, but where were the voices of the victims who were also causes? Why does somebody bully? Tell their story too. I wish Picoult had put me just as much inside the head of the bulliers as the bulliee to optimize the circle of tragedy.I kept thinking about those people we all knew and know on the fringe of high school society whom you just hold your breath for in hopes that they make it through without disaster. Some people you just don't know will survive high school. Any lethal combination of triggers could have just as easily brewed a tragedy at any high school. When tragedy does occur, it's human tendency to want to find the triggers and signs that could have made it avoidable, but can anyone really say what is too much for anyone to handle? It makes you wish everyone could live high school with the empathy and understanding we receive later in life, or at least a glimpse of how we will someday overcome it.The person I related to the most was Angela Phlug who told Peter in her letter that she would have liked to friends with him. That would have been me: noticing the smaller insecure kids but never acting or approaching, only reacting. It is the mainstream kids who just follow along caught up in their own teenage angst that don't have issues with these bullied kids but aren't the outspoken type to make them understand.The character I sympathized with the most is Josie. Not only is she stuck in the middle of shouldering Peter's embarrassment and trying to create her own place in high school, but also, and maybe because of it, she's stuck in an abusive relationship. I felt for her as much as I did for Peter, different circumstances but just as alone. With all the foreshadowing discussion of post-traumatic stress syndrome, I did not expect such a heavy indictment. Between the abuse and Peter's gun pointing at her, I think she should have been shown more mercy, although her extended lie could not have worked in her favor. A heavily victimized character, although Peter's mom Lacy comes to a close second clueless in her grief and losing both of her boys. (I did not however sympathize with Alex's unemotional selfishness.) Surprising that Peter didn't make the top of my list for me too, but maybe that's because he finally acted balancing the scales of pity and discord.My biggest issue with the book would be that we never truly understand Josie's story. Why she was found unconscious with a gash in her forehead? She shot Matt and then what? And why didn't Peter shot himself? He was suicidal. Even though Josie snapped him out of his PTSD and Patrick was there to arrest him, I don't think Picoult justified his inaction enough. You're waiting to learn the entire book why he did not kill himself in the locker room and I wasn't completely satisfied with the answer. And I don't think I ever had a grasp on Josie's feelings for Peter. I understand that before and after she didn't want to see him because he inspired guilt in her, but what exact emotions was she feeling beyond that? I know she didn't like him romantically, but how deep was her level of friendship? Would thy have stayed friends without outside influences? And I didn't like the leap from Peter feeling nothing for her when she leans over him in the copy shop to sending a confession of his love. The confusion with his sexuality was understandable, but I wish the feelings for Josie had come on more gradually--then again normal emotional development does not always correlate with a social outcast. I wish Josie and Peter had had a moment to see each other in the end, or that at least Josie had written Peter a letter. I would have liked some resolution between those two. But that's what a tragedy does is rip apart everyone's lives and there is no easy wrap up to fix grief."

At the local high school, Sterling High, the story follows a routine day of students in classes, at the gym, and in the cafeteria. Suddenly, a loud bang is heard from the parking lot, which turns out to be a bomb set off in Matt Royston's car. As the students are distracted by the noise, gunshots are fired. When Patrick, the only detective on the Sterling police force, arrives at Sterling High, he searches the school to seek out the gunman, who is alleged to be a student. After passing several dead and wounded victims, Patrick traps and arrests the shooter, Peter Houghton, in the locker room, where he finds two students, Josie Cormier and Matt Royston, lying on the floor surrounded in blood. While Matt is dead, having been the only victim shot twice, Josie is not seriously injured, but only shocked: she cannot remember what happened. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش نسخه اصلی: روز دوازدهم ماه اکتبر سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: نوزده دقیقه؛ نویسنده: جودی پیکلت؛ مترجم: کتایون ناصح؛ تهران: کتاب کوله‌پشتی‏‫، 1394؛ در 420 ص؛ شابک: 9786007642641؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21 م‬داستان از روز ششم ماه مارس سال 2007 میلادی در شهر کوچک استرلینگ در نیوهمپشایر آغاز میشود ، دانش آموزان در کلاسها ، سالن بدن سازی و کافه تریا هستند. ناگهان صدای بلندید از پارکینگ شنیده میشود ...؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "I can't stop loving this book, if you guys only have the chance to read this. Sometimes I find her works destructing, annoying and a good sleeping pill for those people who suffer from insomnia. I might be too judgmental but swear, you can take my words after reading her earlier works. This time Picoult wanted to portray a community, a school, where innocent students were bullied by the jocks. The reality of a typical American school environment for students who suffer to stand out in the crowd and to those people who feed in to gain their desires.In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can back scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold for family of five... In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it.In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.In a small town of New Hampshire, Sterling, the people were shattered by an act of violence. A violence that no one expected, a massacre that kills ten students and injured nine. The unforgettable event that widen the understanding of every witness that touches and experience such violent event. From the eye of a seventeen year old boy,Peter Houghton, the act of killing is just the beginning of everything and the act of killing himself to free from his past.Josie Cormier, lying in a blood bath, nobody knows if she was dead or alive but the simple glitch of her body she was discovered to be the only survivor who never injured totally. She can be the witness of the killing, but the down side is, can she ever remember what happened? Besides her, two shots found in the body of the most popular jock andJosie's boyfriend,Matt Royston, no pulse, blood flows and dead on the spot.For the eyes of the two mother,LacyandAlex, both were good mothers, they tried to be with their son and daughter and their friendship that they thought will last long. How can they even manage the situation when they needed each other again for so long? Sometimes, being a good mother takes a lot of sacrifice for the safety of others.I really liked Jodi's concept of applying bullying on one of her books, this one affected me so much. Not because I bullied others, it is because I've been bullied ones. School is a place where most of the students thought that can protect them or us, but this time, a school can only be as dangerous as whatPeterthought. A place where bullies, jocks, queens and the cheerios lived and reign.Nowadays, computer games, social networking or the online life itself can be a tool to gain freedom from the outside world. Some people talk much online or just being friendly to others but personally they are just puppet of the real world. This place is just a place were outsiders come and a place where people thought they are safety. But online, can be a tool to bullying - cyber bullying. You don't know their are people who are talking at your back, trying to send private messages, hiding their faces or they wanted you to be like them. There is no age limit and everyone can do such little creepy crime. When you discovered it, you'll realize their is no such place assafe. ForPeterand the other people who read the book, it will be a lesson to us.The medical (psychology) and law factor of this book, indeed a great success form her other books. It has a stronger structure than her past novels exceptPlain Truthwhich also have the same strong medical and law factor plus she also included great conflict between two cultures. How can she manage to write such book, pact with exciting events? I don't know, maybe she extended her research not only the part of the bullied but also the effect of the simple crime to a child plus her experience.How many people died everyday? How many kids suffering from bullying? How many lives do we need to destroy? or How many kids died of bullying? Wish this book will be a great inspiration to everyone. Everyone have their own role in the society.The bully, the bullied, and the bystander are three characters in a tragic play performed daily in our homes, schools, playgrounds and streets. -The Bully, the Bullied, and the BystanderBarbara ColorosoRating-Nineteen Minutesby Jodi Picoult,5 Sweetsand the ugly bullies!

Nachdem wir direkt zu Beginn den Amoklauf von Peter an seiner Highschool mitbekommen, springen wir zwischen der Vergangenheit und Gegenwart hin und her, um die gesamte Geschichte aus mehreren Sichten beleuchtet zu bekommen.Peter selbst, seinen Mitschülern, dem ermittelnden Polizistin, die Familienangehörigen, der Staatsanwalt. Viele Personen, die man aber trotzdem sehr gut auseinander halten kann. Alle sind wahnsinnig authentisch und realistisch gezeichnet, dass ich nicht einmal das Gefühl hatte, diese Geschichte könnte nicht genau so passiert sein.Sehr bewegend wie die Autorin es schafft ohne selbst zu werten, so viele Perspektiven aufzuzeigen und den Lesenden in seiner eigenen Meinung wie ein PingPong immer hin und her zu werfen.Sehr bewegend und ein super wichtiges Buch. Ich würde mir wünschen, dass es zur Schullektüre gehört! Denn es zeigt ganz wunderbar auf, dass unsere Handlungen und Aussagen etwas bei anderen Bewirken kann. Und das nicht immer nur positiv :/Und auch wenn ich einen großen Plotttwist schnell vorhergesehen habe, war das überhaupt nicht schlimm, denn dieses Buch ist auf keiner Seite bzw. in keiner Minute langweilig und ich konnte immer nur schwer aufhören weiterzuhören.Die Sprecherin Gergana Muskalla ist grandios und vertont die Geschichte fantastisch gut!"

How riveting!But I confess that I wasn't a fan of the conclusion, although acceptable. Regardless, I still think that this book deserves my 5 stars ratings, as I was completely hooked and didn't want to stop reading.I think that I will be reading this book very soon, as I want to make sure that I did not miss anything.Hardcover (published 2007): 464 pages (15-16 hours)e-book (Kobo): 694 pages (default), 188k wordsAudiobook Narrated by Carol Monda: 21.1 hours (normal speed)"

But the last chapter seemed in such a hurry to bring everything to a satisfactory close! It was like an art film had turned into a Bollywood potboiler. I mean, there are PLOT twists, and there are plot TWISTS! This was definitely in the second category. Anyone else who has read this and shared a similar feeling? I am still making up my mind about what rating to give the book.PS: This is the second time this is happening to me with a Jodi Picoult book, the first being the popular \"My Sister's Keeper\".********************************************Join me on the Facebook group, \"Readers Forever!\", for more reviews and other book-related discussions and fun."

        "user_review": "This was such a difficult novel to read.I'd never been bullied in school, or maybe I had been and I just never noticed. I was a straight A's student with no social life outside the classroom and whose idea of fun consisted of staying up all night reading a vampire fantasy. I suppose I felt proud of myself and so any criticism went by mostly unnoticed.That's probably why it was so shocking and appalling to realise that some people suffer the way Peter did, and that the perpetrators usually get away with it.\"When you begin a journey of revenge, start by digging two graves: one for your enemy, and one for yourself. - A Chinese proverb\"This was my first Jodi Picoult novel, and it won't be the last. The writing was smooth; several passages struck me as poignant and memorable. The characters were each unique and reaslitically portrayed; however, I couldn't get attached to any of them, except maybe Jordan and Selena. Diversity-wise this book does a very good job. Moreover, I greatly enjoyed the various discussions on gender expectations and sexual identity, as well as domestic violence, gun control, and mental illness.That being said, Josie's character was beyond irritating. I get that she is only a teenager and obviously not expected to make all the right decisions, but her interactions with Peter and her relationship with that asshole Matt -I'm glad he's dead, as awful as that may sound- made me want to throw the book into the nearest trash can. She was always whining about something or crying or telling herself that she had no other choice, which is definitely not true. I was actually glad whenever Alex did not live up to her expectations, and when things started getting better for Josie I was intensely displeased. I'd liked Alex up to the point when she decided to put her daughter first, not because that's fundamentally wrong but because Josie did not deserve it.-Rant over-The other thing that threw me off was the pace, which started lagging somewhere around the middle of the book and remained turtle slow until the last 40 pages or so. I was really praying for an earth-shattering plot twist to make up for this agonizing wait but sadly, no such thing happened. The final reveal was something I'd expected all along and which anyone with half a brain could have seen coming a mile away.Also, Alex and Patrick's relationship felt like insta-love to me, although I believe they do fit together. It just felt contrived.Overall, I think this is a book worth reading. The message is powerful, both through its content and its way of delivery. How humans behave under pressure (whether internal or external) was masterfully handled. Even Josie's infuriating personality seemed rather authentic. The struggle of Lacy and Lewis and how people treated them afterwards was heartbreaking, and Joey's unperceived cruelty towards his own brother was simply hideous. These and so many other small details serve to makeNineteen Minutesa horrific yet necessary read.So despite any reservations I may have, I think it deserves 4 stars.\"They started it.\""

This is easily my new favorite Jodi Picoult book. It is sad and eye opening on the truth and expanse of bullying. Once again Picoult weaves in a story of more controversial topics and slays it.My quick and simple overall: sad but it is incredibly interesting to read. Fantastic story that touches the reader."

        "user_review": "I picked this up not reading the synopsis and thought it was a book about teen pregnancy. I have liked some of Jodi Picoult's books and felt weary about investing time in a 400+ book. As I started it it was startling to discover it is a book about a high school shooting. The story goes back and forth, sometimes I lost track of where I was but kept reading. The story centers around the mothers of the main characters and the kids involved.Peter is an outsider, a loser, a nerd, a cast off picked on since Kindergarten. Josie, his first best friend changes crowds and doesn't defend him even as he gets bullied by her friends.I didn't like Peter at all the whole story but couldn't help feeling so sad for him. No one listened or did anything to help him even the adults that are supposed to be there to intervene and investigate. He felt he had to do something outrageous to send his message. As the trial went on he did get creepy and I'd go back and forth about what I felt about him. Josie has no backbone. Being popular meant more to her than being a decent human being. Her story also involves physical abuse...The story flowed nicely and it makes one think about their own kids... what didn't I see? Could I have stopped it? Did I create this monster?\"When you look into your baby's eyes,\" Lacy said softly, \"you see everything you hope they can be.... not everything you wish they won't become.\" This to me hit hard, as a mother... could I ever stop loving my kid?It is definitely an emotional story that I think applies to what's going on today in schools and mental illness added on top of that. It shouldn't be normal that schools ignore bullying and then you are forced to homeschool. It shouldn't be normal to get easy access to 2 handguns and 3 rifles. I know that part is controversial.. It was a heartbreaking story."

        "user_review": "the thing about jodi picoult is she always manages to write breathtaking, captivating novels that make youfeel.In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn; color your hair; watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five.In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world; or you can just jump off it.at the beginning of the book, you think you've got it all figured out. you know who the victims are, and you know who the killer is, and you think it should be easy to pick a side in a courtroom. but throughout the book, picoult works on changing those assumptions and stereotypes, works on altering them in subtle ways you never see coming until you realise your moral compass has seemingly been overturned — you don't know which side to choose anymore. the shooter who calculated his killing of ten people, or the bullies who tormented him to that breaking point? you become starry-eyed and admire the popular kids like the others in the book do, and yet chapters told from the shooter's perspective help you realise that they are openly malicious to outcasts, and the girl who exists in both worlds — the main character — reveals to us the shallow, insipid lifestyle they lead, and how popularity is something that can always slip through your fingers.writing this review was cathartic for me in a way. because for a long time after, i couldn't stop thinking about this book. and after a while, i figured maybe putting my thoughts on paper (technically, a review site) would help me make some headway with my roiling thoughts. everyone seemed to understand why the ending played out the way it did. but without spoiling too much, i had been rooting for them, and i didn't feel good about the ending because it hurt.picoult excels in characterisation. she writes character-driven stories, weaving together many threads in the form of side stories until they all collide at the end. she's very masterful in the way she fleshes out every character and gives each of them an important role to play. there are some characters i liked, some i acknowledged, some i despised. this book has it all.and the ending. i can't say i agreed with it, but try as i might, i couldn't think of a more fitting way to end the book. picoult's books always involve some sort of purge, or a plot twist that you don't see coming, and although sometimes i've called them out on being there purely for the shock factor, this one didn't feel that way.A mathematical formula for happiness: Reality divided by Expectations. There were two ways to be happy: improve your reality or lower your expectations."

        "user_review": "Picoult writes books that are easy to read, yet usually compelling topics that are presented in a way that easily spark thought and discussion. If you read enough of them (I've read 4 and picked up on this trend in the second book), you can see that they are forumulaic in plot design and pace. This makes it easy to guess what the \"big twist\" at the end of her book will be. For instance, I suspected very early that Josie shot Matt, really as soon as it was mentioned that he had two bullet wounds where all the other victims had one. Confirmed when the Detective indicated his discoveries about \"Gun B\" and further cemented at the first mention of Matt's abuse of Josie (that added to her constant unease with her place in the popular group). I don't see myself giving any more of her books that I read more than 3 stars, because whereas I typically give the books credit for broaching difficult topics and presenting them is such a way to make the reader think, I don't think they're written in a particularly creative style. The first book of hers I read, \"Sister's Keeper\" I thought was GREAT - because I hadn't read anything like it before. The subsequent books, as mentioned above, were JUST like the previous is form...and admittedly function. The three stars is solely credit for tackling the difficult topics and because her writing isn't BAD, it's just not original anymore. How many times can you see the same magic trick, and still be surprised at the end?"

        "user_review": "Nineteen Minutes is Jodi Picoult's most recent novel, and I predict it will become her best seller to date. It focuses on the events leading up to and following a high school shooting.Peter Houghton, picked on by school mates from the first day of kindergarten, enters Sterling High, and in nineteen minutes kills ten and wounds another nineteen students.In typical fashion, Picoult shapes her story by providing various perspectives. We are able to put the story together from Peter's perspective as well as that of his parents, Judge Alex Cormier, Cormier's daughter Josie – a student in the school on that day, Patrick – a detective on the case, Jordan – Peter's attorney. We are able to see all the characters as \"human\" – sympathetic but faulted.Picoult has always been a great story-teller, and in this novel, she is able to take a ripped from the headlines topic, and create a fictional story that makes the reader think. Justice is served in the novel, but there is a surprise ending and some twists and turns to keep the reader turning pages.With that said, my first reaction upon finishing the novel was, \"that'll make a great movie\". I then realized how sad that reaction was.Nineteen Minutes doesn't contain the artistic writing that Picoult's earlier novels did. A few years ago, when I discovered Jodi Picoult's books, I considered myself a big fan. I loved her novels and anxiously awaited the publishing of the next. I thought her writing was truly gifted! She had a way of telling a story by not telling a story. She wove together threads of personality and insight to create beautiful rich tapestries that were character studies, and by introducing me to a new character I learned something of value.In Nineteen Minutes, Picoult told a story – a good one. But the nuance and magic of her earlier writing is gone. While I enjoyed the novel, there was nothing there that will stay with me. I was like watching a good made for TV movie – well done, but so what?So, perhaps my review of this book isn't fair. I give it three stars, because it is a well-written story. It will be a huge commercial success, and it will be on the best-seller lists. While it may further establish Picoult as a best selling contemporary novelist, it also may mark the end of my Picoult fan-club membership.Ms. Picoult, we all have to pay the mortgage, and I understand. You give the people what they want, and you get financial rewards. I hope that in between these best selling works, you will still exercise that wonderful craft that you have been blessed with. I hope that your new found audience (who WILL buy anything with you name on it) will read some of your earlier novels and see the beauty and intricacies of your writing. I hope that someday soon you will be able to have commercial success by returning to your real gift – the \"art\" of writing."

        "user_review": "\"Cause what you buy, is what you own. And what you own... always comes home to you.\"Louis Creed and his family have recently moved to the town of Ludlow, Maine. Behind their house there is a path that leads to a 'Pet Sematary', where the children of surrounding areas have buried their beloved pets in years gone by. Deeper in the woods there lies an ancient Indian burial ground, that Louis discovers has some sinister properties when their family cat dies...It's no secret that Pet Sematary is my favourite King book, but this is the case for a number of different reasons. When I first started reading horror I couldn't imagine words on a page actually scaring me, I always felt like I needed something visual to keep me up at night. Then I found Pet Sematary... I'd never had an experience before where I actually felt scared to turn the page - this was of course in the climax at the end of the novel. My heart was racing, my palms felt sweaty, I just kept thinking, \"There's no way this book is going to go THAT dark\" (clearly I didn't really know King yet!!). And then it did. And a King junkie and Constant Reader was born. IT was my first King, but Pet Sematary was where I became hooked.**NB Plenty of spoilers ahead**Now it's time to get personal... grief and loss has been a huge part of my life. When I was younger, my dad was diagnosed with MS, a debilitating disease that quite literally drained the life from him in front of our eyes. I guess this is similar in some ways to the Zelda and Rachel storyline, apart from the fact that my dad was never angry or resentful over his illness - or if he was, he never showed it in front of me. He progressively got more and more ill, over time losing his ability to speak, walk, eat. Death was ultimately a relief. But what about those who are left behind? It's strange because even though I was only 10 when he died, which is around 18 years ago, there are still days or times when the unrelenting grief can come out of nowhere and floor me. The loss of a parent is something you never get over, it is simply something you learn to live with. The only thing that can possibly be worse is the loss of a child. King's depiction of the grief and loss that both Louis and Rachel go through is so accurate it hurts. This book really resonated with me on a deep level, as I had never before read such a harrowing and realistic outlook on death and loss. There are so many passages that I've made a note of and will revisit over and over again.The way King crafted a book that is terrifying and heartbreaking in equal measures will never fail to astound me. Because this book IS terrifying - to lose someone is terrifying, to have to try to move on is terrifying, for them to come back \"different\" is also terrifying. Sometimes on instagram I will see people criticising Louis' decisions or making out that he's a bad parent and it makes me want to scream. Grief and loss does not allow for rational thinking. It does not allow for good judgement. It can be all encompassing to the point where you feel like you can't breathe. I defy anyone to tell me that if in a similar position you wouldn't even consider it (not forgetting the fact that there are other forces at work here). I know I would. Couple that with the overwhelming devastation and loss and your decision is pretty made. So to label Louis as a bad parent is absolutely ridiculous to me. Don't get me wrong, there was Ellie to consider, he still had that to live for, but in those heady initial days following such a heartbreaking loss, rational thinking ain't happening.It's a bit of a slow-build this book, but the pay-off is worth it. I enjoyed getting to know the Creeds, watching them form friendships with the Crandalls across the road. All the good stuff, you know, before shit hits the fan. And when shit hits the fan, it is almost too much to take. Gage's little Star Wars shoe in the middle of the road... the cap full of blood. Images that send chills down my spine. Then the unbearable dread as Louis digs up that coffin, not knowing what exactly he is going to be presented with. The way Louis initially thinks that Gage has no head as there is a dark moss covering his face... THIS IS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES. The little figure appearing in Louis' room as he sleeps, the child's laughter that Jud can hear... Ellie having these vivid dreams and knowing that her family is in danger. This is really a masterclass in how to craft well-written, piss-your-pants horror. I bow to you, Sai King.Some of King's best writing in here and one of his best endings too. There's also some unforgettable characters in Louis Creed, Jud Crandall, Victor Pascow and Zelda. PUH-LEASE can I find a Jud Crandall that can act as a father figure to me?? The adaptation for this book is also pretty decent: Louis is a hot dad, Fred Gwynne was born to play the role of Jud, Zelda will trigger a cold sweat to run down your back...I could quite honestly write an entire thesis on Pet Sematary, so I'll end it here. All I'll say is this: if you didn't feel something when reading this book...... you need to check yourself *insert sassy emoji* Always my number 1 King book. 5 stars from me - obviously.Update: listened to audiobook in April/May 2018. Incredible narration by Michael C Hall. Still 5 stars. Obviously.Update 2: reread in March 2019 in anticipation of the new movie. Somehow loved it even more!!Update 3: reread October/November 2020. 5th read. Still my fave.Update 4: reread October/November 2021. 6th read.Update 5: reread October/November 2022. 7th read."

        "user_review": "Wow. Just wow. I've put off reading this one for years because, well.... I'm a wimp.There, I said it.When one of the most well-known names in the contemporary era of the horror genre says something is his scariest book, I take note. It seems bizarre that I finally chose to tackle this one while having children the same age as Louis Creed's, it waspreciselythe perfect time to pick this up. I listened to almost the entire book over a 24-hour period while road-tripping, and the experience was unparalleled to any I've had in the scope of reading thus far.Side note, Michael C. Hall was the most excellent narrator for this. What likely was a 4 star read initially became a 5 star with no second thought. If you haven't experienced this version I cannot recommend it highly enough.Rather than a gory, blood and guts type of horror, this is a slow burning, queasy unease that explodes in the final chapters. The suspense nearly did kill me; by the final 25% I found myself wringing my hands and grinding my teeth, preparing myself for the inevitable that I knew was coming, deep down, ever since the beginning. I don't think I could have fully appreciated what King intended to accomplish with this novel if I'd read it before having children of my own. That's not to say that people without kids won't appreciate this as highly, just as statement in my own personal journey. Only King can accomplish so much horror with so little bloodshed.I finished this days ago but have held off on reviewing until now because I feel like I'm still processing and I can't stop thinking about everything that occurred to this family. I had spent so much time prior to reading this book in preparing myself for the big \"things\" that I was completely taken aback by how connected I became to the Creed family. This is why the detailed, slow burn; if I didn't care about this family, their neighbors, and the town in general, why would what happens at the end stick with me for the long haul? Oh sure, I would have gasped and guffawed at the disturbing nature of the plot, but I wouldn't have been emotionally invested.If you've been hiding under my big rock for the past few decades and are just catching up on your Stephen King backlog, like me, I highly recommend picking this up. It's not just about the scares with this one, but the contemplation on how grief can turn any of us into a monster. By far the best audible book I've chosen yet."

It is one of two Stephen King books I finished in one sitting (the other being The Dead Zone)2. When I was a kid, I had to make sure the cover of this book was not facing out or I could not sleep. I didn't even like to look at it when I was awake!In the introduction to Pet Sematary, King says he almost didn't submit it for publication, and that would have been very sad. Of course, I have listened to other book intros of his and it seems to be a common theme that he almost didn't finish or submit a book. Maybe that is just his usual explanation to increase the drama going into the book. One of the intros (it was to his written as Richard Bachman novel Blaze) said he didn't submit the book for publication originally because it is not that great. Blaze is one of my favorites of his, so, I guess King is his toughest critic! Makes me wonder what other great ideas he has scrapped that we may have missed out on.This is King in his prime! Pet Sematary is the perfect blend of character building, suspense, supernatural, gore, horror, and gut-wrenching shocks. Like his other novel, Cujo, some of the developments might be hard for readers to swallow. You may even curse King's name for doing this to you. But, as a reader, I am searching for shocking and memorable roller coaster rides and that is exactly what I got with this book. Do not start this book expecting to ride in the slow lane or that you might be in for just a little scare. The reality is, this book may give you nightmares and make it hard to sleep at night. You may never look at your pets the same way again. Each time you drive by or visit a graveyard, you may get a chill you have never felt before. This book will get into you and will not let go.I often get asked where a reader should start if they want to try out King. Pet Sematary is a pretty good place to start, ayuh, but it might be a little too much for some to handle!"

It's a perfect example of his style. If you have never read a King novel, this could be a good place for you to start.Classic Kingis definitely my comfort place; it's where I choose to live.This beloved story was somehow even more enjoyable the second time through!When Dr. Louis Creed decides to move his growing family from Chicago to Maine, he could never guess how much that one decision could impact their lives.Like another good 'doctor' before him, Victor Frankenstein, Louis is about to discover the hard way that...This is really such an incredible story. King's writing draws you in and holds onto you until the bitter end.As with many of his tales, there is an overriding feeling of dread and an ominous atmosphere that seeps through every page. It gets in your mind and stays there.The first time I read this, I was in high school. It was the early-90s and this was one of the scariest books I had ever read.I am in 40 now and this is still one of the scariest books I have ever read. In 1983, when this was originally published, I can imagine that it was heralded as a ground-breaking piece of horror fiction.In addition to still loving the characters, I picked up on a lot of details this time around that I don't recall noticing the first time.As an alumna of the University of Maine at Orono, where Dr. Creed takes a position as head of the student health center, I really enjoyed reading the small sections of the story that took place on campus.Side Note:The incident he describes with the fraternity boys who were brought in after crashing their toboggan gave me a good chuckle.My husband's fraternity was at the top of the hill facing the old steam plant. The one with the cannon replicas on it. We used to do all sorts of things on that hill including sledding, snowboarding and even 'slip-n-sliding' in the summer. Yes, injuries ensued.Another detail I picked up on this time around that I either didn't understand on the first go, or had simply forgotten, was all of the references to the legend of the 'wendigo'.When I was in high school I may have assumed this was something King made up instead of a reference to an actual mythical man-eating creature straight out of Algonquin folklore.You see, we didn't have Google at that time...And although I cringed during all scenes related to Church, he was treated so unfairly, I am so happy with this reread. I can definitely picture myself picking this up again and again for years to come.An definitive classic!"

I think because of the said 6 million 5 hundred and 8 times that I have seen it that maybe it acclimated me to the book. Although, the movie is still creepy as hell.I totally freaked at the introduction to the book. Mr. King tells about moving to said place, teaching at the school, they had a cat named Smucky, their son was running to the road chasing the kite string like in the movie, but uh, didn't get killed! And some other things. It was like a whole new little world right there for me that he actually wrote this based on some home stuff!Remember in the book where Jud (the wonderful neighbor) takes them out to the Pet Sematary?SMUCKY THE CAT, one crate-board marker proclaimed. The hand was childish but careful. HE WAS OBEDIANT.Okay, so there was a real (I wonder if it's still there?) Pet Sematary and their cat Smucky is buried there and that is what Mr. King's daughter wrote! I mean, I can't even. I want to go visit there now and see if the place is still there!So wonderful Jud from across the road has a great friendship with Louis and the kids, a little iffy with Rachel.Anyway, Jud is the one that has Louis bury Church (the cat) when he gets hit on that damn road all of those crazy trucks would fly down. But little did Louis know that Church was going to come back, even when the poor boy from the school (Pascow) who got hit by a car and killed, came back as a ghost to warn Louis. Why don't people just listen?So now Church is back home and he isn't the same any more. But the family didn't find out anything happened to him while they were out of town. They just think he's weird and stinks when they get home. Uh, yeah!So then, it all goes to hell in a hand basket.Gage is killed on the road. . . . . .and in the movie you get to see who presides over the funeral.Yup, the King =)and then. . . don't do it . . . don't to it.He does it, Louis takes Gage to the Pet Sematary and yeah. . . Gage isn't the same when he comes back! He kills Jud! Damn it all! and Ellie had been having bad dreams about her daddy so Rachel comes home and goes to Jud's house and she gets killed because Gage isn't Gage any more.And Louis finally takes out Church and Gage, but does he learn from his lesson? Nooooooooooooooo, he takes and buries Rachel in the Sematary. Well, you can use your imagination for the rest of that one. . .This was an awesome book to read for Halloween time or any time really but it's extra special at Halloween! ♥MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List"

        "user_review": "Let´s just ignore the rotten elephant in the room and pretend that we´re a normal, happy family for potentially foreverThere are many spoilers, some with puns that are more dead than alive, so be careful. Seriously, it´s impossible to vivisect this work without revealing secrets, because they´re so essential to the plot.Drifting into darknessIt´s one of Kings´smoothest darkenings of a happy group of people, accompanied by increasing signs of decline towards madness and despair, from animals to humans and mental breakdowns. A big bonus is the unusual precision and shortness of the piece, King distills (not booze) instead of driveling towards 1k pages, making this exceptional dense in atmosphere and action without any length. Maybe the reason was, once again, already not subtly alluded,The substance abuse problemthat made him reduce what, some call too much unnecessary drivel for absolutely no reason, ahem, to the normal amount of words needed to create a book. Subjectively I deem writing this one under the influence of whatever mix he took at this moment more creepy than many of his other works, because it includes sweet pets and kids and has something of a unique, outstanding touch in his whole work. So less real violence, much suspense, and a dark ending make it something creeping the heck out of everyone.Seems legitHonestly one must assume that people will do everything for their loved ones, no matter how dangerous, sick, or disturbing it might look for other humans. And not just strange hardcore DIY fringe shamans without any real, proven necromancy competence and experiences shown on darknet social networks for both Satanists and necrophiles getting really hard on this stuff, but for sober, reputable people with backgrounds in science too. So before someone discriminates desperate family members that practice dark magic, blood sacrifice, or voodoo economics to get their loved ones healthy, wealthy, or alive again, they should stumble a few zombie steps in their shoes. Better a living corpse than a dead body as the saying goes.Personal fearsKing likes to put real life impressions and personal elements into his works, Shining is for instance strongly inspired by his experiences as struggling parent, teacher, and alcoholic. Thereby one can assume that the inspiration for Pet sematary could have been the parents' fear to lose a child and how far one would go to save a loved one.Slow escalationHappy family life is destroyed and the search for a new hope starts with small experimentations that escalate to the ultimate conclusion. Continuing this idea, one could end up not just with special families, but whole towns or states run by extraordinary people. Depending on their mindset, great or terrifying new societies could be built on the grounds of resurrection, as long as there is no daily or weekly limit or how much the sematary can handle or they run out of Charons´obols and go soul broke.The punishment for misusing indigenous burial placesIt seems fair, who sins has to be punished, eye for an eye style. But does that mean that it would be good with permission? Maybe, although then the saved personality may get demented or mad after a certain time, just giving a short, good revival, before returning to the state it would have been with instant blasphemy fueled curse ruining mental capacities and social skills. Better to wait for a mind upload or nanobot repair set for cryogenically frozen dead relatives, because techno optimism seems to be the far safer bet than voodoo zombie puppets.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

        "user_review": "\"It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience. On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls—as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything. And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.\"In the introduction to this edition, Stephen King manages to start the tingles and shivers running up and down my back before I ever read a word of the novel. When a writer like Stephen King says this is the book he wrote that scared him the most, I wonder if I am going to be opening a door in my own mind that I would rather keep triple padlock with the key lost in a different dimension.We've all speculated about all the horrors that are fighting for space in King's mind. How does he sleep at night? I'm just a dabbler, but I will tell you that my thought is he sleeps very well as long as he is able to write each day. Whenever I am being harassed by a story or even maybe just a compelling character, I will find no peace until that concept or character is committed to paper, well pixels.The reason that King finished this book and his initial reaction to the story was to slam it into a drawer and forget it about it is because the plotting of the novel intersected with his life in real time. His daughter, her cat, and the place they were living when he wrote the novel are all captured in the squiggles of his prose. When he finished, he realized he had written a novel he wasn't sure he should have brought into being. Can a novel become reality?The nightmares in this novel are too personal.It makes perfect sense to me to feel compelled to stab a sharp stake through the heart of a manuscript.When Dr. Louis Creed moves his family from Boston to rural Maine, he certainly has preconceived notions about what it will be like to live in the country. Of course, I grew up in the country, and I could have told Louis that there are many hazards for children, pets, and even adults in the country. Leaving Boston behind might have felt like escaping the perils of the city, but all he did was jump from one frying pan into another. The semi-trucks barrelling down the highway outside their house are not only loud but also pushing the pedal to the metal. They are rolling tanks; only a tank's top speed is 45 miles per hour while a semi on a flat road can go about as fast it wants to go.The other problem Dr. Louis Creed has is that he doesn't realize he is a character in a Stephen King novel.Never good. Never good at all.There is a Pet Cemetery, spelled Sematary, not far from their house. It is a spooky place, but beyond the edges of the cemetery is where things get really interesting. The neighbor, 80 year old Jud Crandall, fills Louis in on the local lore.\"'The Micmacs believed this hill was a magic place,' he said. 'Believed this whole forest, from the swamp on north and east was magic. They made this place, and they buried their dead here, away from everything else. Other tribes steered clear of it—the Penobscots said these woods were full of ghosts.'\"There is talk that, if something is buried there, it will….\"Sometimes, dead is better\" and states that \"the place has a power... its own evil purpose.\"But what if something is telling you to go there? What if you wake up in the morning with your head full of restless dreams and caked mud on the bottoms of your feet?This can't really be happening to Louis. There must be a sensible explanation.There is no one more rational about death than Doctor Louis Creed, but death is easy to be rational about until someone you love dies and you start to believe there is another option.The basic structure of the plot will be sussed out by readers fairly early in the book. They will know where things are heading.\"It's the road. It uses up a lot of animals, that road does. Dogs and cats, mostly, but that ain't all.\"The devil is in the details. The real horror is in the growing terror surrounding each new decision. The slow degradation of the Creed family, of rationality, and even joy kept sending chills down my back. Irresistible temptation always seems to be wrapped in evil.\"Let them be anything but the creatures which leap and crawl and slither and shamble in the world between. Let there be God, let there be Sunday morning, let there be smiling Episcopalian ministers in shining white surplices . . . but let there not be these dark and draggling horrors on the nightside of the universe.\"Wishes coming true can be the real horror.What Stephen King does very well is create situations, even implausible situations, and convinces us that WE can be in the middle of something this insidious. We don't feel like these things are happening to other people. We feel like we are smack dab in the middle of all the horror.\"Death is a mystery, and burial is a secret\".Highly recommended!If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"

        "user_review": "Well, I doubt that I'll ever have any other way of saying this, but after reading this book, my mind is well and truly fucked. This book, and the story it tells, pushes the boundaries even for the sanest of individuals. It psychologically grips you, and Stephen King manages to get inside your head, rummage around in there for a bit, and stay there, long after you've finished the book. But, that is what he wants, and that, is another reason why he is one of the greatest authors, that I have read to date.Pet Sematary is my fourth King novel, and having just read The Shining, I wanted more of King's works in my grasp. The Shining, without a doubt, was amazing. I was hooked from beginning to end. When I finished that book, I was inevitably disappointed, as I had an appetite for more, and in a crazy kind of way, I liked feeling unsettled, so I bought Pet Sematary, as I'd heard positive things about it.I went into this book, with the grave assumption that it was about a cat that returned from the dead, hence the front cover, which actually has an evil looking cat on it. It was SO much more than that. Let me put this in my terms. It takes a lot to physiologically disturb me, and in turn, get under my skin. This book was dancing very confidently on that line. At one point, around halfway through, I was reading it at work, and towards the end of a chapter I thought \" Wow, he's not honestly written what I think he has, has he?\" I had to read the next chapter at home.Apparently, King States that this novel is one that he hasn't been able to reread himself as it is THAT scary. Now I've read it myself, I totally understand that statement.I feel I must thank Mr King, for once again, causing my flesh to crawl, my stomach to lurch, and inevitably, adding to my current issue of insomnia."

And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.In my teens, Stephen King has crafted my nightmares. I am masochistically glad to say that in my adulthood, that has not changed.He had been responsible for my bedtime routine. Close all doors, bathroom, closet. Check under bed, a terrifying prospect as it stands. Make sure blanket is firmly tucked in at the feet - who knows what creatures might reach up to grab or nibble on them. Make sure blanket is firmly tucked in on all sides, so that only the head is exposed. And still, all that preparation for the battle that is bedtime is nigh useless as the nightlights cast shadows that turn into shadowy creatures in the depths of night. Glints of light cast upon objects are spun by a restless mind into monsters.It has been years since I've read a Stephen King book. That's because my attention span is much shorter now. It craves the quick denouément, a fast-paced plot. Action action action. I confess that this book did plod along in some parts for me, but despite all that, there is no doubt in my mind that King is a master at building atmosphere. He is tremendously skilled at crafting characters, at making them human, at making them relatable in their poignancy, with moments like a father explaining the inevitability of death to his young child. I think we can all relate to that moment.He held her and rocked her, believing, rightly or wrongly, that Ellie wept for the very intractability of death, its imperviousness to argument or to a little girl's tears; that she wept over its cruel unpredictability; and that she wept because of the human being's wonderful, deadly ability to translate symbols into conclusions that were either fine and noble or blackly terrifying. If all those animals had died and been buried, then Church could die (any time!) and be-buried; and if that could happen to Church, it could happen to her mother, her father, her baby brother. To herself. Death was a vague idea; the Pet Sematary was real.In the texture of those rude markers were truths which even a child's hands could feel.I would say half the book isn't a horror in a traditional sense, butan exploration of human grief and behavior, and human nature itself can be quite terrifying.That isn't to say that this book isn't filled with moments that makes a chill run down your spine.The wind pushed and pulled its fingers through his hair, and for a moment the old, childlike fear of the dark rushed through him, making him feel weak and small and terrorized. Was he really going into the woods with this corpse in his arms, passing under the trees where the wind walked, from darkness into darkness? And alone this time?I've long since outgrown my nightly monster-prepping ritual, but I know tonight I won't be sleeping easily.\"I brought you something, Mommy!\" he screamed. \"I brought you something, Mommy! I brought you something, I brought you something!\""

        "user_review": "4.5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺Pet Sematary.Sematary. Isn't it cute??Okay, maybe not that cute if you consider the fact that some kids bury their dead pets in a sinister place and fulfil all kind of procedures meant for burying people, applying them on their pets. But you have to admit, the misspelling is adorable. So innocent.I've read this book almost three years ago and I literally have no idea how I read this because I felt like I forgot a lot of important things about it. Butthank the Almighty Divinity up therefor the film. I actually enjoyed the film more than I expected, but it was good because it was different from the book and it helped me remember better (because my brain has its own way of functioning and processing, don't ask).I am not going to talk about plots and plot twists and also I am not going to talk that much about the characters either. But I do want to talk a bit aboutoneof the characters though.First off, I want to say that after seeing the film, the image of Louis Creed, the main character, has somehow grown on me. When I was reading the book, I must confess that I didn't feel a real connection towards any of the characters, maybe at some point even despise them a little. And Louis Creed is not an exception. I actually felt like he was warmer in the film than it was in the book. And I had this impression about all of the characters to be completely honest. Maybe I was more insensitive three years ago when I read the book. Or maybe not. Who knows? (I'm still pretty insensitive though).Because I remember feelings sometimes better than words, I must say that this book had some very intense passages that managed to raise the hair on the back of my neck. To make you understand what I'm saying, I have prepared a nice story for you, one that is actually real as it comes:I have a small house at the countryside, typical Romanian you know, with Persian rugs and a terracotta stove and a dim lightbulb that annoys you more than actually helps you see. It was the Easter evening, my folks were outside preparing the grill for the barbecue and I was all alone in my bed reading this book, clearly running away from responsibility. As I said, the light was kind of stupidly annoying, the stove was cracking from time to time and sometimes someone was making weird noises from outside like crashing things or something clumsy like that. Apart from that, everything was semi-shadowy and quiet. The passage I was reading right at that moment was the one when Rachel, Louis' wife, was describing the last time she saw her sick sister alive before she died. I remember that scene as 'the closet scene'. King created a masterpiece out of that scene. It felt so real and so immediate that I started looking at my own closet in the room and praying not to see some inhumanly claws creeping from between the doors. In that particular moment, I felt a chill going down my spine and my heart started somehow racing. I actually yelled for my mother too and she actually came to check on me like I was some kind of baby (she rolled her eyes and left after I told her why I summoned her but at least she came).Giving the fact that the book has some mysticism spice, I think it is worth a shot just for the glimpse of a myth. And maybe who knows? The individual research could go on and maybe even discover something new, interesting and exciting because as I always say, we always have something to learn from a book, even if we have only a tiny detail that grabbed our attention. Everything is worth knowing. Even if it comes from a horror novel! Just make it enjoyable. Everything comes fromwithin."

        "user_review": "\"[S]ometimes dead is better…\"-\tStephen King,Pet SemataryHorror has a deserved reputation for being a genre able to make important societal points while still being fantastically entertaining. To be sure, there is a lot of mindless horror, where excess seems the entire point. But when it's done at the highest levels, it can explore topics as serious and varied as racism, sexism, and nuclear war while still delivering a cathartic fright.Pet Semataryis a high-concept novel that can be boiled down to a single sentence:Indian burial ground brings the dead back to life. In all honesty, it is not a description that instills much confidence that it is anything other than throwaway fiction. It gives off strong vibes of being yet another zombie varietal or the mossy foundation for a Roger Corman movie.During one Halloween season, though, when I began to ask people for some suggestions on seasonal reading, this is the title that was recommended to me over and over again. Having confidence in Stephen King – who is always interesting, even when he's awful – I finally picked this up.***If you are one of those people who's said thatPet Semataryis the scariest thing you've ever read, you are not alone. King himself agrees with you. Indeed, in introducing my version of the book, King claims that even he thought he had gone too far, and that it would never be published.Obviously, this is an unverifiable story that reeks of a carnival barker selling his wares. I doubt King ever worried aboutPet Sematary's prospects for publication, and in terms of grotesqueness and bad taste, this seems almost tame. In a sense, though, I agreed with King's sentiments.Pet Sematarypushes up against the boundaries of what most readers are willing to tolerate in their amusements.***At 395 pages – in my paperback edition – this is a relatively svelte entry by King's standards. I don't think he'd even finished introducing all the characters inThe Standin 395 pages. With all trace of fat and filler sliced away,Pet Semataryis one of King's tighter, more efficient tales. There are only a handful of characters, and just a few big set pieces. King only throws a couple punches, but they all land squarely in the groin.Things kick off with the Creed family (Louis and Rachel, and their two young kids, Eileen and Gage) arriving at their new home in Maine, after relocating from Chicago. Louis is a doctor who has taken a job with the University of Maine. Their new house is a big and beautiful New England colonial. The only downside is that it's located right next to a busy road well-traveled by recklessly speeding semitrucks.The Creed's new neighbor is the benignly intrusive Jud Crandall, an old man who steps in to fill the paternal role that Louis missed due to his own father's premature death. It doesn't take long for Jud to show Louis some of their new home's features. Prominent among them is a pet cemetery that has a misspelled sign giving this book its title. Through Jud – a classic King character, who is always oversharing – we learn that beyond the pet cemetery is a Micmac burial ground. According to Jud, he buried his childhood dog in that space, and it came back to life, a canine Lazarus that was suddenly meaner than hell and smelled like death.For a shortish book,Pet Semataryis long on setup. It takes its time building to the inevitable consequences of living next to a place that cheats Death. For the first 200 or so pages, not a lot happens, though King generously foreshadows much of what is to follow.At the halfway point, he delivers a shot to the solar plexus with a major twist – followed by two cheap writer's tricks – all in succession. Starting with this breathless sequence, things race straight downhill to the chilling finale.The twist itself – which hides in plain sight – is King's crowning achievement. It is not a scene of supernatural horror or apocalyptic fireworks. Instead, it is an immensely powerful portrait of sorrow that is closer to James Agee'sA Death in the Familythan anything else from the master of pop horror.***Part of King's success has been his ability to use horror to his own ends. He's always worked at both the textual and subtextual level. He places a premium on his stories, to be sure, but always gives over space to ponder his themes. At his worst (the simplistic parable ofThe Green Mile), King wields his motifs with all the subtlety of Jack Nicholson putting an axe into Scatman Crothers. At his best (the portrait of an abusive, alcoholic father inThe Shining), King's subtext enriches and deepens what might otherwise be a forgettable spook-story.Pet Semataryis, in some respects, vintage horror. But it worked for me – unpleasantly – on its second level. This is King's meditation on the enormity of loss and the devastation of grief.All King's books are filled with death, but this is the rare book – not just in the King canon, but in general – that deals squarely with dying. It realizes the uncomfortable truth that our own deaths, while frightening, do not come close to the unspeakable prospect of losing the people we love. This reality – and it is very real – is so powerful that it has to be diluted lest the message become unpalatable. That is King's true accomplishment, to be able to riff on ideas of life, death, and the afterlife without turning you away.Pet Semataryis almost good enough to deliver its sharp message without making you want to crawl into a corner and curl into the fetal position.Almost.***It seems like a lot of people first read Stephen King in their late-teens. Maybe a King novel was the first big \"adult\" book they ever read. When they read his stuff, they were genuinely scared, because they had yet to experience the true terrors of the world of adults.With an exception or two, every King book I've read has been in my thirties and forties. Thus, theBoo!moments don't make a hugely profound impression on me. I am pretty much immune – to the point of indifference – with literary descriptions of the macabre. This is simply a function of having seen too much to be truly shivered by ghosts, aliens, or a homicidal Plymouth Fury. I love King's books, but it's not his jump-scares that get me, but the insights into the human condition that are cleverly concealed behind the fearful symbols.***Pet Sematary's evocation of death is both philosophical and impactful, and even the novel's cheap-gore elements cannot obscure its force. Horror is often viewed as a healthy way to channel our toxic fears. But King provides no release. He makes you look into the void of death, with all its infinite uncertainties, and simply ponder how hard it is to say goodbye.Pet Sematarygave me nightmares. Not of monsters or ghosts or zombie pets, but of busy roads, unwatched children, and the hidden clock that starts ticking away the moment we're born.Pet Semataryis a transcendent masterpiece of the horror genre. At the same time, it is exceedingly unpleasant to read, and certainly nothing I will ever pick up again. Once you strip away its grisly trappings, you are left with the chilling conclusion that we all imagine but refuse to say aloud: that all of us will lose everything."

        "user_review": "'Sometimes dead is better.'One of King's greatest strengths is that his best scares are less the monsters and more the way he subtly seeds horror in the mundanities of everyday life.Pet Sematary, a novel dripping with dread, spooks the reader by making death an antagonist we think we could overcome but unleash hell in the process. Yet it is through transforming grief and parental anxieties into tales of terror that truly frightens. I remember reading this for the first time at 14, bundled in bed against the autumn chills tapping at my window when the final scene rises up to deliver a scare that occurs on a sunny midday while outdoors and suddenly even terror could loom even in idyllic landscapes. That haunted me for years, and is a large reason why King is such a gem that frightens through he ages: he hits you where you feel safe and he hits you riding emotions that we all inevitably feel.Pet Semataryis a now-classic horror novel that examines grief and male fragility and will have you shrieking in both fright and fun.'I don't think children ever forget the lies their parents tell them.'Everyone has likely said anything there is to be said about this book, but here I go anyway. This is a book that really sticks with you and I suspect it is because it dives into the depths of emotions we all have but don't display openly, especially men in American culture that are couched into seeing overt displays of emotion as a flaw, especially one's like fear, grief and sadness that King probes here. 'The soil of a man's heart is stonier,' Jud tells our protagonist, Louis Creed, and this sort of myth making about masculinity has caused many to suffer in silence. The men, sure, but more so those closest to them that are harmed and haunted by their inability to productively process emotion which often turns rather toxic. Much of the trauma in this novel comes from Louis attempting to cover up and push death aside, first with the cat and later with the child, as an attempt to avoid dealing with death. When Winston Churchill, or Church as he is called, is killed, Louis and Jud go beyond the local cemetery to a place rumored to bring back the dead…but 'the barrier was not meant to be crossed,' and dark things are ahead.But let's pause on the death of Church for a moment (names like Church and the last name Creed definitely imply some religious aspects) because as children our first brush with death usually comes from our pets. I mean, basically the whole reason you get a fish so your parents can explain death to you. The intentional misspelling of the title 'Sematary,' comes from the misspelling of the little animal cemetery in the woods near the Creed house, which is riddled with adorable misspellings in children's handwriting on the numerous tombstones. It is a great example of combining death with the coziness of childhood, reminding us all that it is a fact of life—a sad one—and something we inevitably have to confront. Instead of dealing with his daughter's grief and stepping up as a parent, Louis opts to push death and grief aside for a quick fix, but as we soon learn, trauma forestalled ferments into something far more sinister…When Louis asks his neighbor if anyone has ever attempted this with a human, Jud retorts 'NO! Whoever would!?King being King, we know we will soon learn the truth and that it is more terrifying than we can imagine. Which is another aspect I love about him, he will drop into backstory that paints horror with a palette of nostalgia and small town dynamics, making even the quaintest little village a breeding ground of fear. King is, of course, playing on parent's greatest fears with this novel, one he nearly confronted himself when a semi almost ran over his own child and inspired this novel. Louis' inability to properly grieve, and thinking he can have a magical fix becomes his own undoing.'Rachel, is that you? I've been waiting for you, Rachel. And now I'm going to twist your back like mine, so you'll never get out of bed again…'The side-story of Zelda, Rachel Creed's sister whom she had to care for as a child despite being horrified by her condition suffering from spinal meningitis, is another example of the paternal figure pushing aside problems. Here the trauma is dumped into the lap of his youngest daughter (as Nocturnalux pointed out, this is one of King's many nods toThe Haunting of Hill House), an issue that doesn't do anything to help the bad relationship between Louis and his father-in-law. It wound's his masculinity all the more when a man he doesn't respect calls his own abilities as a \"man\" into question at the funeral.Without a strong male figure in his life that he respects—or respects him—Louis finds Jud to be a surrogate father, 'the man who should have been his father.' I can't think of Jud without picturing Fred Gwynne in the role of the 1989 film and hearing his voice saying \"it's that damn road there.\" I just want that guy's voice to be my voicemail message, it's so good. In Jud he sees the representation of the American Dream, older married couple still in love, retired and passing down his kindness and knowledge. Except Jud knows dark things. And Jud will later be haunted by his dead wife and her claiming to have slept with many man in their marital bed is a well-executed horror moment for the novel's themes because it is something that threatens his sense of masculinity the most. I mean, I don't really know if King was going out to critique toxic masculinity (doubtful actually, as the wife isn't a very well-done character and mostly serves the characters ego and...services him in a scene that certainly opened my eyes at 14 and includes a line about things she learned as a girl scout...uhhhh) but it is so much a part of American culture that this critique becomes natural when looking for a way to discomfort men.This is a wildly uncomfortable novel in many ways, and that is what makes it truly stick. King strikes hard and turning the grief of a lost child into a horror story of demonic resurrection is pretty damn effective.Pet Sematarylives on as a classic—it has even had multiple film adaptations—and is a delightfully good frightfest.3.5/5'The most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.'"

Anyways, at least instead of looking at the song lyrics we perform, I always hid a Stephen King book inside my music folder and read them during practice! But the day I read Pet Sematary, I started screaming as I reached the chapters evil Gage returned back from death! That was the time I proved I had the strongest vocal cords, earning my nickname as baby Jamie Lee Curtis!This book may be the creepiest, most tear jerking, traumatized book king of the authors has written. The ending was FREAKING AMAZING! Maybe the best conclusion the author has written!At 2019 movie adaptation they changed the original final which was also good but I still insist the book was still so much better!"

Somebody asked what was the scariest movie you've watched, and my mom without thinking said'Pet Sematary'. I remember laughing and saying'How on earth could a movie named Pet Sematary be scary?'Fast forward to now, I changed my mind.This book is the scariest and creepiest book I've ever read, and I'm sure it'll stay number 1 for a long time. It made me think about stuff I don't want, or refuse, to think about. One being death. Most of us don't want to think about death, 'cause we think we're invincible... But we're not. Like this book said, Oz the Great and Terrible (or should I say Gweat and Tewwible?) is always close... waiting.At a few parts, I even thought about putting the book down, because it was all too much, but I just couldn't. I wasn't even able to stop reading, 'cause I was dying (no pun intended) to know what was going to happen next. I guess horror books do that do you.In conclusion, amazing book, and I'm definitely gonna re-read it in (very,verydistant) future."

Of all his master works, however, I take the somewhat unpopular stance that Pet Sematary is his magnum opus. Re-reading it now only confirms this opinion.When I first read Pet Sematary (I couldn't have been older than 13) I knew right away that it was more than a typical scary story. For one, it made me feel decades older. Wiser. More entuned to human nature. King never shies away from character, but he really digs deep with Louis Creed. There are numerous novels that portray death well (James Agee's A Death in the Family is superb) but fittingly enough, it's this gothic horror novel that illustrates it best. Death isn't pretty and surviving it can be just as grotesque. Pet Sematary gives all of this to us, and more. Much more than we want to see. But maybe we need to see it to understand.We often scream at characters in horror movies for doing stupid things (WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE YOU IDIOT!?) and arguably Louis Creed does some stupid things in this book. King adds supernatural influence as justification, but let's be honest - no justification is needed. Creed and his decisions are as relatable as they are tragic, which is something never quite accomplished--not on the same level at least--with Jack Torrance or Annie Wilkes or Carrie White. Not dissing those other books, I'm a fan boy for them too, but it's why I think Pet Sematary is King's greatest achievement.For those interested in reading this one, for the first time or 20th, I highly recommend the new audio version narrated by Michael C. Hall. His outstanding performance enriches the novel in ways I hadn't noticed before."

The unease and anxiety just keeps building in this book and it's brutal!I'll have to be honest here.I almost couldn't get through this book because of the griefStephen Kingputs the readers through. It overwhelmed me since it felt similar to what I went through in regards to the deaths of my father and brother.That's some damn fine writing since it affected me so bad!But I pressed on and I'm glad I did. I loved the part with Louis and Jud when they tookTHEtrip into the woods. It was so atmospheric, and I was on the edge of my seat.You just know at that point in the book that things are going to drastically change whenthey bury Church.I felt sorry for Louis and the decisions he kept having to endure. It was gut wrenching and I'm not sure what I would have done in his shoes.This book is character driven and about the decisions we make in life. Good and bad!Kingdid such a good job with this!Other thoughts, I did not like the character of Rachel Creed. She was a weak character, and I hated how she took her parents side and did not stick with Louis, her husband.And one last thing.Killer kids freak me out the most in horror books and movies!!Total epic! Gah!"

Because there are too many different ideas on the subject. What we know is this: When we die, one of two things happens. Either our souls and thoughts somehow survive the experience of dying or they don't. If they do, that opens up every possibility you could think of. If they don't, it's just blotto. The end.\"When the Creeds move into a beautiful old house in Ludlow, Maine, it all seems too good to be true, a physician father, beautiful wife, charming little daughter, adorable infant son and now an idyllic home. As a family, they've got it all, right down to the friendly cat.But despite Ludlow's tranquility, an undercurrent of danger exists there. The trucks on the road outside the Creed's beautiful old home travel by just a little too quickly, as is evidenced by the makeshift graveyard in the nearby woods where generations of children have buried their beloved pets.Then there are the warnings to Dr Creed both real and in his dreams, that he should not venture beyond the borders of this little graveyard where another burial ground lies. A blood chilling truth is hidden there, more terrifying than death...and hideously more powerful.This book review took me a long time to write. I needed to take a few days to process my feelings. Pet Sematary is my favourite Stephen King novel and this wasn't my first time reading it.This book gets into my head and lives there like a parasite. It's like nothing I've ever read before. I was enjoying reading the story, but then I didn't want to pick up the book. I didn't want to face the onslaught of emotions I knew were coming my way. That's the level of horror it delivers… and I love horror. This book haunts me so much because it has the rawest depiction of grief I've ever come across in a book.Expertly written and flawless characters as always. It's haunting. It's disturbing. I am still emotionally drained after reading it. By far the most horrific and upsetting of Stephen King's works.I recommend this book but not to the faint of heart or to the emotionally fragile.One of my favourite quotes from the book:\"And the most terrifying question of all may be just how much horror the human mind can stand and still maintain a wakeful, staring, unrelenting sanity.\""

It is a phenomenally good book that grew in my opinion over the years (I actually read it for the first time in the 80s). On the one hand you have numerous excellent horror elements (the cemetery, the Wendigo, Zelda and those coming back from that place, like Church or Gadge). On the other hand it describes in a relentless way what happens if man plays God and tries to resurrect the dead (sometimes it's better to stay dead). Those people returning from the Micmac place are changed in a very unpleasant way. Lazarus is a very strong motif throughout the book. The whole story is masterly plotted and told. Jud Crandall is a very sinister character that leads Louis into temptation. The old Micmac burial place is brilliant and one of the eeriest places in horror literature. Vic Pascow's warnings come to late. The book is about death and what comes after death. It's not only what you'd expect about 80s horror but very philosophical. This book makes you really think about life and death. Absolutely awsome novel and must read. I'm very glad that I read that book in advanced years again!"

        "user_review": "Pet Sematary, Stephen KingPet Sematary is a 1983 horror novel by American writer Stephen King. In November 2013. Louis Creed, a doctor from Chicago, is appointed director of the University of Maine's campus health service. He moves to a large house near the small town of Ludlow with his wife Rachel, their two young children, Ellie and Gage, and Ellie's cat, Church. From the moment they arrive, the family runs into trouble: Ellie hurts her knee and Gage is stung by a bee. Their new neighbor, an elderly man named Jud Crandall, comes to help.He warns Louis and Rachel about the highway that runs past their house, which is frequented by speeding trucks. Jud and Louis quickly become close friends. Since Louis's father died when he was three, he sees Jud as a surrogate father. A few weeks after the Creeds move in, Jud takes the family on a walk in the woods behind their home. A well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled \"sematary\" on the sign) where the children of the town bury their deceased animals. The outing provokes a heated argument between Louis and Rachel the next day.Rachel disapproves of discussing death, and she worries about how Ellie may be affected by what she saw at the \"sematary.\" It is explained later that Rachel was traumatized by the early death of her sister, Zelda, from spinal meningitis—an issue that is brought up several times in flashbacks. Louis empathizes with his wife, and blames her parents for her trauma, who left Rachel at home alone with her sister when she died. Louis himself has a traumatic experience during the first week of classes. Victor Pascow, a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident, addresses his dying words to Louis personally, even though the two men are strangers.On the night following Pascow's death, Louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets Pascow, who leads him to the deadfall at the back of the \"sematary\" and warns him to not go beyond there. Louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was, in fact, a dream—until he finds his feet and bedsheets covered with dried mud and pine needles. Nevertheless, Louis dismisses the dream as the product of the stress he experienced during Pascow's death, coupled with his wife's lingering anxieties about the subject of death. On Halloween, Jud's wife Norma suffers a near-fatal heart attack, but makes a quick recovery thanks to Louis's help. Jud is grateful and decides to repay Louis after Church is run over outside his home around Thanksgiving. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال2012میلادیعنوان: غبرستان حیوانات خانگی؛ نویسنده: استفن کینگ؛ مترجم: افسانه محمدی‌شاهرخ؛ تهران نشر قطره‏‫، سال1390؛ در580ص؛ ‬‬شابک9786001193477؛ چاپ دوم سال1392؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده20مکتاب «غبرستان حیوانات خانگی» یک کتاب در ژانر ترسناک اثر «استیون کینگ» است که در سال1983میلادی منتشر شده‌ است؛ واژه ی «سماتاری» با حرف «سی» در زبان انگلیسی به معنای «قبرستان» است؛ اما «استیفن کینگ» به عنوان یک اسم خاص و از املای دیگرگونه بهره جسته‌ اند؛ به همین سبب، در ترجمه فارسی هم از واژه ویژه ی «غبرستان»، به جای «قبرستان» استفاده شده‌ است؛ «لوئیز کرید» پزشک اهل «شیکاگو» که برای آرامش و دوری از هیاهوی شهری به همراه همسر، دختر، و پسرش، به یک دهکده، در میان جنگل‌های انبوه نقل مکان می‌کند؛ پس از گذشت چند روز درمی‌یابد، در جنگل، بخشی وجود دارد، که گورستان حیوانات خانگی است، البته املای آن به صورت اشتباه نوشته شده‌ است؛ در آن مکان، اگر حیوان مرده‌ ای دفن شود، آن حیوان زنده می‌شود؛ پس از مرگ گربه ی «لوئیز»، وی گربه را در آن مکان دفن می‌کند، گربه بازمی‌گردد؛ چندی بعد دختر کوچک «لوئیز»، در تصادفی در جاده کشته می‌شود؛ و «لوئیز» برای برگرداندن وی، دخترش را در آن مکان دفن می‌کند؛ دختر زنده می‌شود اما خیلی چیزها دیگر شده‌ اندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/03/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 13/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

Interestingly I started reading King after seeing one of my favorite movies of all time- The Shawshank Redemption (based on his work,Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemptionfrom his 1982 collection Different Seasons). This book is no different from all of his other works. In this one, too, we can see his impeccable writing skills. The story runs around Dr. Louis Creed and his family and their new home and its surroundings in Ludlow, New England. Pet cemetery and the Micmac burial ground near it forms the crux of the story.King has used manyMedical Metaphorswell in this book. We see Louis saying once,\"Don't monkey with a wound that has finally started to heal.\"We can also see Louis wonderfully explainingMedical detachmentto his friends. Still, how Louis was behaving as a Doctor in the first part of the novel is a little hard to digest (Maybe it is due to the effect of the power from the burial ground which King himself is comparing with How dope - addicts feel good when they are putting Heroin in their arms). Somecatsare indeed grumpy and weird. But generalizing and saying that all cats are weird was too much for an ailurophile like me. (I love pets, and this was a little hard to digest). These are the only minor glitches I found in this novel. In short, this novel is a story of one normal man's encounter with the forces of ineffable evil. If you have got this book already in your hands, don't think twice; just start reading because this one is a real page-turner."

Not dissing those other books, I'm a fan boy for them too, but it's why I think Pet Sematary is King's greatest achievement.For those interested in reading this one, for the first time or 20th, I highly recommend the new audio version narrated by Michael C. Hall. His outstanding performance enriches the novel in ways I hadn't noticed before."

        "user_review": "I first read this book when I was about twelve and thought it was really scary. But I had since forgotten absolutely everything about it other than what everyone already knows about the basic premise ofPet Sematary. It wasthis recent poston the B&N blog that convinced me to read it again. With a few exceptions, I'm actually a big fan of Stephen King and it seemed about time to get reacquainted with his \"scariest\" work.And... well, I was disappointed. The story holding this book up is still an excellent one, but today the idea felt more chilling than the actual execution. In fact, everything about this book felt really quite dated. From the scares that were not-so-scary compared to, say, Netflix'sMarianne(a Stephen King recommendation, to be honest), to the way Louis spoke about the women around him.I usually enjoy King's meandering style of over-description and slow build-up through detailed characterization, but here the characters grated on me. I struggled to keep my attention on the pages as we followed Louis Creed through his daily life as a doctor. Rachel was irritatingly twee, too.King's books are usually something like 20% horror and 80% character drama, which usually works really well for me, but it failed here because of my disinterest in said characters.Facebook|Instagram"

        "user_review": "I read The Shining,my first Stephen King book back in summer of 2016 and was absolutely blown away by it. Since then I've been reading King's books religiously to find the next masterpiece that could push the limits of a sane mind. Well, It took me two years and eleven more King's books to find it, and on the way, I met many great contenders like Pennywise, Barlow and George Stark. But it wasPet Semataryand the horrors that paid a visit to the small family in Ludlow that finally won me over.❝ The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis. A man grows what he can, and he tends it. 'Cause what you buy, is what you own. And what you own... always comes home to you.❞Louis Creed and his family have just moved from Chicago to the small town of Ludlow. They moved because Louis got appointed as Director of University of Maine's health services. They settle in their house quite nicely. The house big and cozy, and Louis quickly becomes friends with Jud and his wife, their elderly neighbors. His wife Rachel, and two young children, Ellie and Gage is happy. Even Ellie's cat Church is happy! The only tiny problem is the highway road dividing Louis's house and Jud's house, where speeding trucks travels relentlessly...Oh, There is also the matter of Pet Sematary: an old ground where pet owners bury their faithful dead pets.Also, the old Indian legends...The mysterious land with a peculiar hold on people....A secret and forbidden climb...Don't look back...*Shakes head*Did I space out? I spaced out, didn't I?!First of all, Mr. King? That man got some serious guts.He based the premise and characters for this novel from his own life while he was teaching at the University of Maine. There are too many parallels between what actually happened in King's life and what he wrote in his novel. I think that's the reason he calls this book as his scariest book.It's too damn personal.Pet Sematary scared me not the way other horror novels or movies scare people. Pet semetery is not about jump scares or other worldly creatures instilling terror upon our sad species(I mean, reanimation is not on the top of food chain when it comes to being scary. I practically snoozed through Frankenstein, and Lovecraft's Herbert West: The re-animator was fun, not scary)For me, Pet semetery worked because King makes the characters feel like your own family, fill you with care and love for them, and then asks you the question:What will you do If you were standing where Louis is standing? Will you climb or stand your ground?As usual, King characters are well crafted and full of life. The bromance between Jud and Louis is endearing, and Louis's young daughter Elle and toddler Gage are delightful.Why, King, WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?The story also boasts a lot of strong secondary characters, and King scores big with a perfect cast.My favorite part of entire novelis in the first half itself when Louis and Jud take the nocturnal excursion to the woods. That sequence had the right amount of creepiness, mystery and a haunting beauty. I kept on imagining unusually bright stars standing still and looking down at Louis and Jud as a chilly wind blew across the woods; A daunting dreamy quality to the whole affair. Weirdly, I kept on thinking thatGuillermo del Torowill be able to do great things with this sequence! Later on, I found out that del Toro was actually in talks to make a remake of Pet Sematary, but the project fell through.I'll be honest here.The grief King created in the second half was almost unbearable, andI was stuck between not wanting to read the novel because it was too painful and at the same time, I was unable to put it down because the writing was too damn mesmerizing. King once again excels in horror department because of the way he crafts the unfathomable pull of the Pet Sematary. It's the intangibility of the horror that I found beautiful.The scare factor is not just limited to a couple of reanimated corpses or the Wendigo, but the mystery of the Pet Sematary and inexplicable feelings and intrusions the characters felt, and how they lost battles with themselvesAnother reason for my perfect rating is the ending. It was flawless.Also, I loved the Jerusalem lot's reference. It felt like two cursed lands were fighting among themselves to consume their prey. Perfection!Overall, Pet Sematary has everything I wanted, and my hunt for next perfect story in Stephen King's shelves continues with renewed energy!"

        "user_review": "Houdini Heart is the \"Mulholland Drive\" of books. Like Lynch's movie, it's this, it's that. It's not this, it's not that. People can discuss it, argue over it, think about it, read it again and again, but camps get created. Some might think it's a dream. Some a descent into madness. Some think she's trapped in a haunted house. Or hotel. Or town. For some, the creative process is set out in this woman's terrible tragic story. Perhaps it's about the destruction of the self to make art. Others have no patience unless they're reading a simple tale told in a straightforward manner. They're uncomfortable not being sure. Others want things spelled out. They don't like being confused. They want a pat and expected ending. They want a book written like their ABCs on lined paper. But some people, like me, love finding themselves in a Chinese Box, patting walls to find doors, opening doors to find walls behind them, climbing stairs that are never the same from one moment to the next. Like Mulholland Drive, our anti-heroine is asleep. Does she really wake up when she says she does? Or does the dream go on and on? Did she do what she says she did? Did she die doing it? Does she live forever by leaving the reality we believe in to enter one she believes in? Her own work?But if you really pay attention, there's an inexorable logic to all of it. There are no loose ends. This is one well knitted book.There's so much to say about this book. So many ideas that crawl under the skin like ants.I am in love with this book. What a movie it would make. If I were an actress, I'd kill for the role. (Another idea: did she kill for her role?)"

Longfellow seems to be able to write anything. This one is nothing likeThe Secret MagdaleneorFlow Down Like Silver: Hypatia of Alexandria. It sneaky and sly and up-to-date and strange and pure literature even though it goes down like oil. It's about a writer, a second-rate writer, whose life has come to such a pass (partly through her own doing) that she's on the run. Which brings her back to the only town in her ambitious life that meant anything to her. A small town in Vermont in which stands a old hotel she remembers as magical. River House has come down in the world, just as she has, and together they weave themselves into a fantastical knot of other people's talent, first rate talent, or first rate ghosts. I loved it. I think it's right up there with the very best psychological horror."

At the same time, it is a tribute to a good deal of horror fiction and film that has preceded it. While telling its own story, it echoes precursors from Lovecraft to Shirley Jackson to Hitchcock to Stephen King, with more too numerous to list along the way. Although the narrator/protagonist is living in a huge five-story rooming house, once a grand hotel, the novel creates a sense of claustrophobic terror that keeps growing throughout the read. A compelling descent into madness and hallucination with some fine writing along the way."

A night-dark and utterly convincing depiction of a mind unravelling, leavened by genuine wit and compassion and made all the more compelling by a beautifully rendered central character who I couldn't help but be both captivated and appalled by. I felt quite nuts myself by the end! There are two absolutely gruesome moments (which I wont spoiler here) where I had to stop (I cant remember the last time I had to do that) and a gloriously insane WTF moment at the end. This is also a book of subtle richness that yields even more on a second, more measured, read. This book will stay with me for a looooooooong time."

In horror stories you either get eaten by the monster or you have to defeat the monster. Ghost stories have their own kind of sense. Something truly haunts a place. Or it haunts a person. A demon, the newly dead, a force, usually ill intended. But this story makes no sense at all.\"It's very atmospheric, it goes as deep as you want it to, it can be interpreted in as many - or as few - ways as you wish.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, is that at times it can get almost *too* uncaring about making sense. Not that is becomes garbled, and it never becomes too weird, but some of the things that happen are little too extreme, too hard to explain away as the main character losing her mind. It's The Yellow Wallpaper, but not as subtle as that story, which kind of makes it a little less effective. BUT, that's only my interpretation of it, because I *want* that interpretation, because I like it best.I could put a \"but maybe not\" after every sentence in that last paragraph and it would still be true. It's a remarkable book, I know I'll be thinking about it for quite a while."

A story told in first person as if the reader were that person, and you go along, gradually learning why you're in Vermont and why you're in River House and what you've done. But you're never prepared for what you're going to do next. You think you could never do these things, that you're not that kind of person, but you're wrong. You don't think much of your work (you're a writer) but you think way too much of the work of others even as you hate their lives. And you hate your life. But you cling to it even as it becomes a funhouse of mad mirrors. I once saw a movie called Angel Heart and as soon as I finished it, I started it all over again just to see how it was made. I watched it again to marvel at the symbols and signals placed in every frame telling the story visually. I intend reading this a few times more for exactly the same reason."

The novel takes it shots at Hollywood and reveals the trials and tribulations of writers, and the horror that they suffer unto their own minds.I also found many similarities to the popular and polarizing work ofDanielewski's House of Leaves, although I'd guess unintentional. Those liking House of Leaves I feel are likely to love this, but this work also succeeds in every area House of Leaves drew complaints. In the end, you don't need Danielewski's if you can write like this.side note:while this is not of the young-adult genre, it does seem to be a good fit for young teens wishing to read some good horror that doesn't include vampires that sparkle."

This is one of those books that once you begin, and have to put it down for any reason, it calls to you: read me, read me, come back and read me. So you do even if reading it gets a little weirder by the page. It starts out so easily, so sadly, so normally. A woman at the end of the line, trying to come home. She's a writer still trying to write even though her life is in ruins all around her. But she believes she has one last book and so she gets a room in a hotel she loved as a child, and from there...well, from there you just follow her down and down and down or perhaps up and up and up.

It's why I don't write about the books I read, the ones I don't like, or even the ones I love. But I wanted to say something about this particular book. A lot of people love it. A couple don't like it at all. Now that I've read it myself, I can see why it would be seen so differently by different people. It's different. It doesn't fit easily into a neat slot called horror or fantasy or a thriller or a mystery even though there's something of all those about it. It's written in the first person. Some people don't like first person books. They're hard to do. If they don't work, they really don't work. The person speaking isn't named. We know she's a writer, we know she's running from something terrible, we know she's come to the end of the line. She tells us. She's honest. She doesn't hide and she doesn't brag and she doesn't pull her punches. And she slowly, over time, tells us what that terrible thing is. We watch her react to it. She's not mad. She's rational. It's rational to fall down a deep dark hole after all she's been through. Who wouldn't?The woman is fascinating. I wanted to know all about her. Reading the book I felt I'd wasn't really reading but instead I was listening to her talk to me. She's so real. She scared me. She made me feel bad for her. I understood her horror. I was right there with her, right to the end.For those who really don't care for the book, there are many more who do. I think this is a great book. I won't be forgetting it."

I was with whoever she was from her first mutterings. There's a book within this book. It pretends to be bits and pieces of our anti-heroines best novel, but when you take it out, and lay it down all by itself, it's a short story. And here is the key or the \"heart\" of thing, I think. The Windigo's Daughter eats people like any self-respecting windigo would. And she's managed to worm her way into \"our\" world of movie stars and writers and nice little Vermont towns. She doesn't want to go back to the fantastical world she's escaped. She's hungry and there's food here. I see this as the perfect (pardon me) metaphor for the artist. And our heroine in the outer book, the one wrapped around the short story, is most definitely an artist. Everything she does is done with the dedication of the born artist. In other words, she'd eat her young to write one great book. I loved this thing. I shall read it again and again until I get it. I almost get it. But like a firefly, it remains just out of the reach.

        "user_review": "As I think Sondra said in the review of this book, every reader will understand this book in his own way.I have just finished it and I am gobsmacked. Not only because of the book itself, but how it managed to creep under my skin, seep into my brain and affect my everyday life while I was reading it. Now I don't mean to sound dramatic or easily influenced, but I suppose it's part of each reader understanding the book based on their own experiences.First of all, the writing is fantastic, it's so easy to read, so so easy! It flows, it reads itself without you having to put effort into reading. There are layers, intentional or unintentional, there are sentences where I thought the author was trying to be 'cool' and 'hip' and overly simplistic and cliche and I didn't like it at all but then.. I don't think that was the intention at all. I hope it wasn't. i hope Ki Longfellow is perhaps too clever to do that. Now I've not read any of her other books yet (they are there on my Kindle waiting for their turn) so Houdini Heart was my introduction to this author, and this is why I gave it 4 starts. In case other books are more.. I don't know... More enjoyable, better? There's nothing wrong with Houdini Heart for me not to give it 5 stars and I might change the rating shortly. But for now, it's 4 stars. 4 and a half if I could. I'm looking forward to see if her writing style and language is different in other books.I agree with everything other reviewers have said, with their ideas and views (which is unusual) because their guesses are as good as mine.I didn't think it was a horror book, I didn't find it scary as such, not because of all the blood or secrets, the girl, the old woman and a dog, not because of Windigo hiding in the woods (I read about Windigo after i read the book, but by then i knew what it was anyway) however it's psychological side reminded me of Stephen King books, when something just gets into your mind... And sits there..knocking and reminding of its presence occasionally. Like the old woman knocking on the door at night. It scared me because it made me sad. I wanted to be left alone while I read it, and when I wasn't reading I was feeling so so sad, because it was a story of me, of everyone here who lost those who they loved, of those who live with someone who are running from themselves, of those who are trying to go home to safety but it just wakes something insane, of those who think they make right choices... And yet it's a story of someone who is a creation of Ki's imagination. Or is it? She loved a big star, she lived and created together...I think Houdini Heart is so popular and reaches so many of us because it really is a story of each and every one of us little madness and search for escape.I've finished the book only half an hour ago, there's still much for me to think and rethink about and guess and find answers to. So I'll finish here and will come back when emotions and impressions settle a bit. Or when I find answers and want to share them.It is a great book for everyone, those who want a life drama, those who want horror, those who want hauntings, those who want a different read, those who want a book that's easy to read, those who like questions, everyone.And at the same time I can see why someone would not enjoy the book. It's not really a horror story, there isn't much of a story development as such unless you have something in your life that makes you pick your brain, torture yourself with, scratch your old wounds..."

        "user_review": "Where did this come from? Just when you think you know a writer, they come from out of nowhere with a completely different book. I was electrified as I read it. We are completely inside this woman, with her every step of her way. We don't know what the world outside her head is really like, if her perceptions are accurate or deluded. All we can do is walk in her shoes, think her unusual thoughts, see what she sees or thinks she sees. This is NOT your usual horror. It's magically real with real horror along the way. It's also psychological, deeply understanding of what can happen to a mind when it's stretched to its breaking point. And this is a creative mind, a writer's mind, used to making things up. It's what she does for a living. So is she writing a story? Or living one? I love still asking these questions. No putting the book aside when you're done and forgetting about it. Once you've read it, you're stuck with it. Love that. More stars! (If I loved this, I wonder what her first book,China Blues, is like? Off to read that one.)"

Written in first person directly to the reader, but not like a letter from abroad, more like a letter to herself describing in chatty witty detail all she sees and feels as she free falls into hell. But I'm not sure it's hell. Perhaps she has gone home where she belongs. Perhaps she has been completely taken over by the artistic process. Perhaps all of these things. She is a monster I grew to love. LikeGrendel. One of my favorite books. Clever. Brilliant. This book and that one."

As an elegant version of Stephen King's 'The Shining' told from a female perspective? A love story to literary and cinematic horrors past, present and future? A taut psychological drama resplendent with dark humor and twisted storytelling? All these things? None?One of my favorite reads of 2011 and without a doubt destined to join my ever-expanding list of favorites; it comes highly recommended from me."

Someone here wrote that this is like the movie \"Mulholland Drive.\" I couldn't agree more. I thought I knew what was happening, and then I didn't, and then I did. And then when I turned the last page, I did and I didn't. I love that. It means I can chew on all the levels, all the possibilities, all the tricks, and all the truths. This is horror all right. But it's not the flimsy horror that can be run from like zombies or vampires or perfect storms. It's the kind of horror I imagine those who suffer something so unbearable endures, so they simply don't bear it. Instead they retreat into another world. Is that world better than the one they're escaping? But it's also magical. Someone else researched the Windigo to understand the central \"idea.\" I hadn't thought of that. It added a whole new dimension to what was already a mind-popper. I have to read this book again. It needs more stars."

        "user_review": "I had no idea what I was in for when I began this book. But Houdini Heart is extraordinary. The writing is exquisite, and I love the voice Longfellow created for this work. Despite the unreliable narrator and the confabulous events she relates, her voice remains piercingly honest. It is unforgettable. And despite her \"heroines\" precarious mental state and loss of equilibrium, the narrative is a perfect balance of terror interwoven with sly humor, without mitigating either. That's a tough balancing act to pull off! And despite the atrocities she describes, she manages to remain utterly likeable."

It's everything I love about books. Incredibly written by a writer with perfect pitch, a story that unravels before your eyes, layers and layers of meaning, telling little touches about a real writer's need to write, horror and magical realism woven together so closely it's like being lost in a maze. And our heroine is honest, funny, witty, lost, broken yet still standing in her disintigrating world, and so finely drawn that no matter what she's done, or why, you can't help but love her understand."

What could she do? She'd reached her own personal end of the line. In most stories, the protagonist finds a way out. In some of those stories that way is deeply unsatisfying. For me,The Roadis a example of a terrible ending even as I walked with him and his son, captivated until that moment. There are other books where the ending is deeply satisfying. Most of Raymond Chandler for instance. He'll just go on being Chandler and that pleases me. Then there's a handful of books where the ending is yours. You end it. You decide. This book gets inside you. You are the woman. I loved the feeling. I was disturbed by it.Did I mention the writing is splendid?"

I could draw upon the elusive symbolism of the text in the manner of a perspicacious hermeneut whose convoluted exegesis would only serve to frustrate him even more. Or like a blurb-writer I could summarise the four-and-a-half characters, the austere landscape, the leafless tree, the role of the taut rope and jangling bucket, and the heap of nonsense, but what would that achieve?Suffice it to say that the sheer speed of the bare dialogue makes you want to slow down and look for something queer happening between the lines, but nothing happens. Or perhaps everything happens? You can look at from any number of angles and it adapts itself to your point of view. You can attach any meaning to the memorable symbolism and it helps you comprehend that meaning. You may hypothesize at will and the text will lend you a hand to prove it.Beckett in his frugal minimalist brilliance paints a powerful imagery of an agitated self, a helpless being, a lonely traveller, in eternal yet meaningless wait, which life ultimately is, till we take the final leap into oblivion. The act of wait, which is an act of life, is given a comic dimension in the play. By the end the reader becomes one with the characters, waiting for things to happen, forsomethingto happen, but nothing ever happens. Yet life happens.I think it's impossible to reviewWaiting for Godotadequately, not even after a long and thorough analysis, because in that case one would be seeking directions where none exist.The best review of the play is the one that is not written.February '15"

        "user_review": "Who wants to see a play in which nothing happens? Who wants to see a play in which the characters make little or no sense? Who wants to see a play in which the same senseless nothingness is repeated in the second and only other act? Not me that's for sure. I honestly don't think I could sit through a production of this, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate its artistic merit on the page.Nothing happens, but that is the beauty of it.A famous theatre reviewer once said \"this is a play in which nothing happens, twice.\" He was right, of course, but at the same time recognised the brilliance of the play. The fact that nothing happens is the reason why this play is so clever and tragic. The characters are stuck in this cycle of nothingness; they are destined to spend each day waiting for the mysterious entity known as Godot. He never comes. If nothingness didn't happen twice then we, as the audience, would be unaware of this fact and, consequently, be ignorant to the tragic brilliance of the play.\"ESTRAGON: I can't go on like this.VLADIMIR: That's what you think.\"Indeed, the plot is bizarrely simple: two men Vladimir and Estragon are simply waiting for Godot. They don't remember why they are waiting or even who this Godot character is. They just know that they must wait. Whilst they wait they encounter two equally as strange characters, Pozzo and Lucky. Lucky is Pozzo's slave for no apparent reason and the two seem completely dependent on each other like Vladimir and Estragon are themselves. The four engage in a weird and perplexing conversation, and then go about their business. The next act is very similar to the first.Beckett breaks the rulesThe play belongs to the absurdist theatre branch, which challenges the conventions of the realism theatre of the ninetieth and early twentieth centuries; it does the exact opposite to what was considered a well-made play. The characters carry out a chain of repetitive and mundane dialogue, which is completely devoid of any concreate meaning. There are no geographical or historical specifications as the dialogue is reduced down to a series of pointless statements. We have no idea where these characters are or where they've come from. The play appears illogical and rich in purposelessness, but it is utterly brilliant; it was something completely \"out there\" at the time, and still is really.\"Estragon: We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist?Vladimir: Yes, yes, we're magicians.\"In all honestly this play is excruciating to read; it is completely awful in parts and frustrating, but the idea Samuel Beckett conveys at the same time is grand; it makes up for the torture he has put you through as you look back and realise what he has achieved: you look back and understand why he has broken all the conventions and wrote a play that is as absurd as it is genius. By doing so he has recognised the strange absurdity that is human existence, and questioned the purposelessness of this thing we call life. He has created a Tragedy, as great as any that came before it, by using the most unconventional of methods.I could never give this a five star rating because it is just too painful to read regardless of what it achieves. However, to ignore the artistic merit of the play would be an act of pure self-conceiting ignorance. As Estragon says:\"Estragon: People are bloody ignorant apes.\"I will never read this again, or ever go to watch it at a theatre, but it is something I look back on and say \"what a brilliant idea\" even if I found the reading process quite painful and dull."

        "user_review": "When he wrote Godot, Samuel Beckett was setting out to Flatten his self and its native habitat into a thin strip of organic material, much as a biologist would slice a strip of life paper-thin, in order to prepare a glass slide for his microscope.Next, Beckett applied the reductionism of a modern Occam's Razor (the KISS Principle: 'keep it simple, stupid!') to his belief that the universe is absurd.Henceforth all meaning would become for him and his audience a reductio ad absurdem into sharp Meaninglessness.Now, it's funny - but I just realized tonight that I often take a Bachelardian turn with my reviews, and turn the irreducibly hard and fractious facts of my daily life into the soft butter of rêverie through the mediation of imagination and dreaming. That's my Asperger's speaking.I was, you see, wondering how to pound the irréfragable walnut of Beckett into digestible bite-sized morsels. For Beckett - and Godot - are notoriously hard nuts to crack, even if sliced paper-thin. His iron will was irréfragable, as is mine.So for starters, I turned to memories of James Knowlson's authorized (Beckett himself blessed it) biography of the Grand Old Absurdist...In it, we learn a key clue to Godot: Beckett, unlike so many of us avidly introverted readers, was a hard-edged extroverted egghead.Think of Bertrand Russell.Like Beckett, he was an extroverted intellectual who worked fiendishly to forget life's prickly pains and aporias.Extroverts seem perhaps to have turned out that way largely in an effort to forget private painful emotions.And Beckett, perhaps similarly to Russell, felt suffocated by the rowdily demonstrative emotions of his Irish family.So like Stephen Dedalus, he created an escape world of pure intellect. Emotionally, he was running on empty.Vladimir and Estragon are also running on empty.They see life as a hopeless dead end. Their affective foils, Pozzo and Lucky, live a sadomasochistic tragicomedy that, because of its emotion, nevertheless always contains hope.Vladimir and Estragon are extroverted intellectuals who agree with Voltaire when he said life is a comedy to those who think, but a tragedy to those who feel.Lucky and Pozzo would only respond that life is fullness to those who feel, but emptiness to those who think.The epochal director Werner Herzog once made a brief film about the deranged Antarctic penguins who abandon their happy friends to venture alone, deep within the subcontinent to certain death. Like Ulysses' fabled Second Voyage.Who's right? All depends which side of the fence you're sitting on. I'm not an intellectual penguin either (I take my happy pills on schedule)!As for me, I'm mostly a Lucky, who's never given up on life no matter HOW much it hurts. That was the Lord's way too.You have to keep moving upward, He tells us. And moreover, nihilism is a sinkhole - an aporetic Slough of Despond. And Herzog and Beckett knew that, but kept travelling into the emptiness within. Are they right?I think I'll follow the LORD's way out of this mess, rather than indulge in Beckett's hollow laughter, on his endless inner voyage -ANY DAY.Even though I share Beckett's flattened but steely simplified self...For that is the penultimate step before realising the End is Endless -And eternal, insofar as we give up our unending pursuit of an ultimate impregnable position of rest."

        "user_review": "Aunque es algo habitual en este tipo de textos, no deja de ser curiosa la cantidad y variedad de interpretaciones a la que se presta la obra, solo hay que leer los comentarios de los compañeros y compañeras de goodreads, entre los que se defienden posiciones a veces radicalmente opuestas. Ahí es donde, pienso yo, radica la gran popularidad de la que goza: al igual que una imagen del test de Rorschach, la obra se metamorfosea en aquello que le importa a cada lector.Pero, ¿cuál es la interpretación correcta? No creo que se pueda hablar en estos términos. ¿Correcta es la interpretación que coincide con el propósito del autor? Si es así, tenemos un problema. Beckett, con toda la inteligencia del mundo, nunca quiso aclarar el sentido de la obra más allá de negar a Dios como el ser que figura detrás del personaje de Godot, lo que no ha impedido nunca que infinidad de lectores sigan haciendo dicha correspondencia.Obviamente, yo también tengo mi interpretación a esta mancha de Rorschach.POZZO: Díganme el medio de ser breve y claro al mismo tiempo. Déjenme reflexionar.ESTRAGON: Sea locuaz, así acabará antes.Intentaré acabar antes:Yo no soy uno de los que ven a Dios detrás de Godot, como tampoco me encuentro entre los que piensan que el propósito de la obra sea denunciar el absurdo de la existencia humana, ni su falta de propósito, ni su vacío, ni la ausencia de salida, ni pienso, por supuesto, que la obra sea un mero absurdo sin pies ni cabeza como símbolo del sinsentido del destino humano. Mi opinión es que \"Esperando a Godot\" nos dice, nos grita, justo lo contrario: ACTÚA, NO ESPERES A GODOT.La obra es absurda como absurdo ha sido, es, y seguramente será, el comportamiento del ser humano, un comportamiento que no responde a un destino sino a una ignorante elección.ESTRAGÓN.- La gente es estúpida.La obra critica precisamente que la historia de la humanidad haya sido la historia de una espera, de una espera sin recompensa. Generación tras generación se ha procedido de la misma forma, sin aprender, sin recordar lo que se hizo ayer, donde se estuvo y, claro está, sin saber dónde se estará mañana ni lo que se hará más allá de... sí, eso precisamente, esperar a Godot. Toda la historia de la humanidad no ha sido más que un trágico círculo recorrido un millón de veces. No es, por tanto, un relato sobre el callejón sin salida que se establece entre la desesperación y el cálido refugio de los dioses, es una llamada a la acción, a volver a recuperar nuestros derechos:ESTRAGON: ¿Ya no tenemos derechos?VLADIMIR: Me harías reír, si me estuviera permitido.ESTRAGON: ¿Los hemos perdido?VLADIMIR: Los hemos vendido.Hay que rebelarse ante el poderoso, darse cuenta de que el poderoso depende absolutamente del siervo; hasta el poderoso debe despertar del sueño de sus razonamientos injusta y patéticamente justificativos.POZZO: Trata de inspirarme piedad para que no me separe de él... Cree que, viéndole tan eficaz cargador, le emplearé como tal en el futuro... Cree que al verle infatigable, me arrepentiré de mi decisión. Tal es su lamentable cálculo. Como si me faltasen peones... Piensan que yo hubiera podido estar en su lugar y él en el mío. Si el azar no se hubiera opuesto. A cada cual lo suyo... en lugar de ponerle de patitas en la calle, es tal mi bondad que lo llevo al mercado de San Salvador, en donde espero sacar algo de él. Lo cierto es que a seres como éste no se les puede echar. Para hacerlo bien, sería necesario matarles.Los Vladimir tiene que darse cuenta de que no es cierto que lo único que se pueda hacer es ocupar la espera;VLADIMIR: Con esto hemos pasado el ratoESTRAGON: Hubiera pasado igual de todos modos.VLADIMIR: Sí, pero menos rápido.los Estragón deben tener el coraje de desligarse de los Vladimir; y ambos deben de dejar de conformarse con juegos de palabras, paradojas y discusiones bizantinas que les alejen del enfrentamiento con su condición, ambos deben optar por la valentía del movimiento;ESTRAGON: ¿Y qué hacemos ahora?VLADIMIR: No sé.ESTRAGON: Vayámonos.VLADIMIR: No podemos.ESTRAGON: ¿Por qué?VLADIMIR: Esperamos a Godot.ESTRAGON: Es cierto.Tampoco hay que excusarse en atávicos pecados originales.ESTRAGON: Habría que volver de una vez a la naturaleza.VLADIMIR: Lo hemos intentado.ESTRAGON: Es cierto.VLADIMIR: Oh, lo peor es eso, desde luego.ESTRAGON: Entonces, ¿qué es?VLADIMIR: Haber pensado.ESTRAGON: Evidentemente.Ni en la fugacidad de la existencia.POZZO: un día nacimos, un día moriremos, el mismo día, el mismo instante, ¿no le basta? Dan a luz a caballo sobre una tumba, el día brilla por un instante, y, después, de nuevo la noche.Ni echar la culpa a la época en la que nos ha tocado vivir, ni enredarnos con las palabras.POZZO:No hablemos mal de nuestra época, no es peor que las pasadas. (Silencio) Pero tampoco hablemos bien. (Silencio) No hablemos.ESTRAGON: Entretanto, intentemos hablar sin exaltarnos, ya que somos incapaces de callarnos.VLADIMIR: Es cierto, somos incansables.ESTRAGON: Es para no pensar.VLADIMIR: Tenemos justificación.ESTRAGON: Es para no escuchar.VLADIMIR: Tenemos nuestras razones.ESTRAGON: Todas las voces muertas.VLADIMIR: Hacen ruido de alas.(...)VLADIMIR: No les basta haber vivido.ESTRAGON: Necesitan hablar de ella.VLADIMIR: No les basta con estar muertas.ESTRAGON: No es suficiente.No hay que parapetarse tras una condición humana inamovibleVLADIMIR: No se puede hacer nada.ESTRAGON: Es inútil esforzarse.VLADIMIR: Uno sigue siendo lo que es.ESTRAGON: Por mucho que se retuerza.VLADIMIR: El fondo no cambia.ESTRAGON: Nada que hacer.En definitiva:NO PREGUNTES QUÉ PUEDE HACER GODOT POR TI; PREGÚNTATE QUÉ PUEDES HACER TÚ POR TI, POR TODOS."

        "user_review": "I read this book while hang-gliding over the coast of Liechtenstein. It was difficult to grip the jacket of the book, not only because I was airborne, but because the night before I was in Moscow having vodka and gasoline with Luis San Baptista Rodolfo Sr., a ex-foot soldier for the Revolutionary FALN, and my head was POUNDING! I told Luis over a dinner (red cabbage over braised Skeletor Dolls) I had never seen the last episode of Family Ties, and he instantly grew furious, and cried out, \"Matushka! Matushka! My cauliflower is on fire!\" and thrust a copy of \"Waiting for Godot\" into my pocket, and whispered into my big toe, \"Listen, my friend, I only have a credit card, so I put on my visa and you give me cash, no?\"I immediately understood Luis' implicit instructions: the only proper way to read Beckett truly, to feel the power of his words, is to do so while manning non-mechanical aircraft.At first, I found Beckett's dramatic universe too glib, even watery, like a Burmese jungle cat. I found the dialogue too reliant upon the use of words. I thought the use of characters instead of sandwiches or tuxedos was trite and derivative. I also found the verdant pastures of Liechtenstein simply enchanting from an aerial point of view. Several times, I found myself questioning my decision to question my decision to use McDonald's wrappers from the Basque Region for the material of my hang-glider's wings, but then I realized, that's the point: having no discernible narrative thru-line is STILL a narrative thru-line all the same. Beckett's brilliance touched me at last. (But without permission, so I'm suing him in the Hague.)So, I'm giving this a 5. Not a strong five. But not a weak five either. The sort of 5 that actively worked out for the high school rugby team, but then spent college taking it easy, drinking Irish Car Bombs, and now, years later plays Ultimate Frisbee on the weekends and sometimes runs in Central Park in the evenings, if not doing Bikram Yoga in Soho."

Wait in vain while sinking into a minimalist decor: A forest, a tree, a rope.

        "user_review": "\"Let's go.\"\"We can't.\"\"Why not?\"\"We're waiting for Godot.\"Samuel Beckett, though known for being one of the bleakest writers ever, was a big fan of American film comedians, including the sadsack Buster Keaton. Here's a short film, 21 minutes long, \"the Goat:\" (Oh, come on, just look at it for a minute!)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6kE2...And here's another short film where Keaton and Beckett collaborated! (Thanks, Ean!):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjdXi...but also Laurel and Hardy, who I have always thought were a kind of model for the hapless and lovable Didi and Gogo. Here's a 20-minute L&H film, \"Helpmates\" (1932) in case you had never heard of them or doubt there is a connection: (see above, watch a minute, and I also note there's a new film based on them just released)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YPhY...And there also is a hat exchange scene in the play that almost surely owes something to the famous Marx Brothers' \"mirror scene\" which, if you haven't seen it, takes 3:21 to see some genius old-time comedy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_fmU...Oh, the play, you ask? One of the classics of world literature, probably the single text that earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature, a play that he calls a tragi-comedy, and it does seem to ride on that razor edge between comedy and tragedy. Written in 1948, just three years after the end of WWII, with bombed cities all around (as now in Ukraine) it features two tramps, Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo) who mainly just, yup, sit around and wait for Godot. And talk with each other.\"They also serve who only stand and wait\" (Milton)? Maybe, but in this play it is not clear who Godot is, or why they are waiting for him. Some speculate Godot is really God, but Beckett denied this, said he had no idea why people would think that, and I may just believe him. There is some discussion of religion in the play, though, as a way people try to make sense of the world.The setting is spare, with a single bare tree on the set. What do they do? They mainly talk to pass the time:\"Words, words, words. . .\"And I like the playfulness:Yes, let's abuse each other!Moron!Vermin!Abortion!Morpion!Sewer-rat!Curate!Cretin!Critic!Oh!He wilts, vanquished, and turns away.Well, that passed the time.It was passing, anyway.But it made it pass more quickly.So they converse. They are friends, and they pluckily support each other in their poverty and bleak circumstances. They also meet Pozzo and his slave, Lucky, where we see a contrast to their supportive relationship, a power relationship, one of cruelty. An allegory of choices for us? Fascism vs. the Allied Forces that defeated it? Maybe! But Gogo and Didi persist and prevail, together. Not much happens, but they present an image of steadfastness in the face of serious challenges. Inspirational, I say. Or, since they only wait, and do not leave, it could be seen as hopeless, as a kind of nihilist stasis! Dystopian allegory, a precursor to Cormac McCarthy's father-son story, The Road?One thing the play is about, I think, is how they got to this dystopian desert of a place. One thing it is about is language, which we sometimes see as the flower of humankind, yet in all its glory it did not help us prevent the Holocaust. Another thing the play is about is rationality, or thinking, the very foundation of science and technological accomplishment, that also did not prevent Nagasaki and Hiroshima. And so Beckett makes absurd fun at times here of this much-revered human process, thinking, and what it (in 1948) has amounted to, in part demonstrated in Lucky's unpunctuated stream-of-consciousness soliloquy, which it turns out is absurd.But this play finally presents two equally possible directions for humankind:Hope: \"Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. . . To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late!\"Or despair: \"Nothing to be done.\"Does Beckett choose? Does he make a final judgement? Have we descended as a human race into evil, at last? Here he seems to say it could go either way: \"The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh. Let us not then speak ill of our generation, it is not any unhappier than its predecessors.\"More fascist tendencies now, climate apocalypse, millions of refugees in increasing numbers and desperation, Putin and all the insane political extremism everywhere, and so on. You decide. Because you need to decide to act and not just talk. Or maybe you just ignore everything and keep doing what you do, in a kind of paralysis.Though I personally think he does finally choose hope, in the very image of friends Didi and Gogo."

The directed striped his rendition down to bare existential black and white by filming in Antarctica and using penguins as actors. The problem of dialogue is solved by the technique of voice-over.In the first act, two penguins stand on bleak, snow-covered ice. There's a close up of one penguin. The voice-over says, \"Nothing to be done.\"The camera slowly scans to the other penguin who waddles next to the first. His voice-over begins, \"I'm beginning to come round to that opinion.\"The play continues in this manner. Occasionally, the two penguins rock back and forth in their stark, empty white world. When in the middle of the second act, a third penguin approaches, the two penguins waddle awkwardly to an icy hill and then toboggan on their stomachs down the hill and into the water.After a soul-searching monologue, the third penguin also toboggans down the hill into the water. At the end of the play the two original penguins rock back and forth. One penguin says, \"Well, shall we go swimming again?The other penguin replies, \"Yes, let's go.\"But the penguins do not move."

        "user_review": "A nice homage would be to write nothing.*That is what I wrote this afternoon. Before that, a friend told me to write something. He was so sure that I could. I am never sure about what I can or cannot do. But he thought so. That was nice.Nothing much happened after that, until another kind friend paid this review a visit and said \"to wait\". And \"ifhedoes not show up tomorrow...\" Well, what is to be done then? There are messengers that assured me he would come. I will keep waiting. Contemplating the same places, the same scenarios, over and over, until I can predict the entire world.Never neglect the little things of life.And then I think. And then, some more. Do I really want to keep waiting?I wonder if I even have that choice.Then, a beautiful woman with a quick mind that could leave you staring at your shoes, utterly perplexed, came along. She told me that I comprehended an author with finesse. I thanked her, of course. But... did I? In the middle of this constant—and often tiresome—analysis that I cannot escape from, can I even begin to grasp the concept of anything at all?There is meaning, somewhere. But I fear it will keep evading our presence until... Ah. Choose the metaphor you like.This is getting alarming.A couple of minutes later, another lovely woman said that this was clever. I am not sure of that since I believe Goodreads would delete this in a heartbeat. But, oh well.Nothing to be done.The second I finished writing this, a third woman, equally stunning and of enviable wits, appeared. This good friend that I so admire, asked me something like \"Can we keep waiting even when he makes an appearance?\" And that made me ponder. Are we prepared for such a visit? Us, simple mortals, are we ready to face that kind of revelation? We are still waiting by that tree. Still complaining about so much waiting. But I wouldn't know what to do if...I may be mistaken, though. I have the feeling I thought about this yesterday. Not sure what day is today but I definitely thought about this... yesterday. God.Either I forget immediately or I never forget.I was about to leave when another kind man approached and left a lovely comment about the quality of this review. I often disagree but that is how my head functions. And it is always nice to read that, so I thanked him.It's the normal thing.After some time—do not know how much time since I can never measure it—another friend stopped by. He was asking when to read a certain book. He was not waiting for Godot, he was waiting for the right time. Oh. That might just be him...No. Ah, yes. Time. That unforgiving time that refuses to stop. Time flows, always. Always the minutes. Always the decades. Even if we remain in the same place, with the same glance, the same companionship: ourselves. I would like that friend to read this book as soon as possible. But I do not own the proper words to convince him. Hell, I do not own any word. They own me; a powerless captive. So, I think, I believe, I cannot say much.We wait... A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let it go to waste. Come, let's go to work! In an instant all will vanish and we'll be alone once more, in the midst of nothingness!Or worse, we won't be here at all....you have to decide, my friend.Later, another friend came along and said that this review was his favorite of the year so far. And I thought that was a lovely compliment. The problem is that I kept thinking. And analyzing. And in further reflection I said to myself, \"okay, I know I cannot measure time, I know that I am not sure if I am still living a yesterday or I am already living my tomorrow because this permanent sense of ennui that fills each day makes me forget everything, but I am aware that the year has just started.\" And here we are, standing on this immense world with a myriad of possibilities and its inexorable absurdity haunting us everyday—an absurdity that allows anything to happen—so the fact that this review full of nonsense is someone's favorite of the year that has just begun, made me think. A better one might be written tomorrow. Or in a minute. And then, that's it. Ah. Stop thinking.All I know is that the hours are long, under these conditions....Let us not waste our time in idle discourse!I will make sure to say this as soon as I see this friend. Because days will pass and time will pass and things must be said....the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more.But that endless process does not apply to our ephemeral nature.\"Lovely musings\", another friend wrote a couple of minutes ago. But when you think about it, there's nothing much to do, really. We are always looking for something new. Something else. Nothing much for me to find.It'd pass the time, they say. I haven't met anyone yet with the ability of breaking that vicious circle. We are here to spend time... And watch the sky as it changes its colors. A constant feeling ofanother day done with. We want to move, we say we'll go, we stay right here, like a not so lucky man with a rope around his neck.Honestly.One is not master of one's mood.As I was about to conclude with this illogical ode to the absurd, this dull melody that echoes the unpredictable nature of things and the tiresome search for what we are not meant to know, two more friends came along. The first one claimed to have seenhim, the reason of it all. Apparently, he was trying to remember something. And at a cafe, no less! Whereas some of us are part of this useless but inevitable seek of meaning in life, trying to fill the gaps with something that might embody some source of comfort rather than simply embrace such absurdity of existence, hope for nothing and achieve a sense of freedom—if not freedom itself—Godot is passing the time at a cafe, completely unaware of our existence and our strong desire to meet him, as we see our days go by. Days that no longer perceive a different color....habit is a great deadener.The last friend recommended me to watch the play that introduced me to these people that were waiting for Godot. And then mentioned another one. I cannot think of a better ending to this preposterous review. To postpone for a while this awfully exhausting search for meaning and enjoy another play that will probably make me think of that search almost immediately.Human nature, my friend.To be continued.If you write.Jan 12, 16* Also onmy blog."

They are quite meaningless, but yellow dots please my Scandinavian eyes.It is about nothing, really. ButNothingwas already taken by Henry Green - and also filled with so much of everything - that Samuel Beckett probably thought he'd wait and see if he could find a better title than nothing. While waiting, he gave it a working title, and that's what the play turned into. The process became the end product, and the waiting for something became something of its own.As for the characters. They talk, therefore they are.One of them asks me:\"Are you ready to write?\"And I say: \"Yes, let's write!\"But I don't move."

        "user_review": "Book Review4 out of 5 stars toWaiting for Godot, written in 1952 bySamuel Beckett. Mankind in general is made up of both passive and active people. In Samuel Beckett's absurdist play Waiting for Godot, there are four characters who can be directly compared to universal mankind. Estragon and Vladimir are considered passive people because they sit back and let life pass them by, unlike Pozzo and Lucky, who are active people because they live new adventures from day to day. Samuel Beckett's play is a direct commentary on universal mankind and shows that the world is made up of \"couch potatoes\" and \"Energizer bunnies\" who have distinct differences.Estragon and Vladimir are the passive people and could be considered the \"couch potatoes\" of today's world. They sit around and do the same things day-in and day-out. \"Couch potatoes\" get up, watch TV, sleep, watch TV, eat, and rarely expend any energy. Estragon and Vladimir have daily rituals of removing boots, eating carrots, waiting for Godot, talking of beatings, and forgetting what they did the day before. Both \"couch potatoes\" and Beckett's characters do absolutely nothing and as a result, the days run into each other with no boundaries. There is confusion and chaos everywhere. Throughout his play, Samuel Beckett's characters portray elements of mankind who do nothing and live in a world of inaction and laziness. They are passive like Estragon and Vladimir.However, Pozzo and Lucky show the active elements of universal mankind. They could be considered the \"Energizer bunnies\" of today's world. Lucky runs around, foams at the mouth, recites incomprehensible speeches, and carries his master around subserviently like a true slave. From day to day they visit new places and meet with Estragon and Vladimir in different atmospheres. Pozzo also is very active like an \"Energizer bunny.\" He, as well as Lucky, \"keep on licking and never take a licking.\" Together they are constantly on the move from new place to new place. Similar to the real people of the world, Pozzo and Lucky are active. The active people will hop a plane to Paris one day and the next be swimming in Sydney, Australia. They live new adventures daily like Pozzo and Lucky. The characters in Samuel Beckett's play are directly related to universal mankind who at times can be an active people.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

        "user_review": "PASSARE IL TEMPOIl film francese di Emmanuel Courcol (2020).L'occasione per due parole intorno al capolavoro di Samuel Beckett mi è offerta da un film francese che ho visto di recente.Film francese (Un triomphe – The Big Hit – Un anno con Godot) che si ispira a un fatto successo in Svezia nel 1985: cinque detenuti, impegnati dal carcere come attori di teatro, approfittarono di una replica teatrale per evadere.Fatto che aveva già ispirato un film svedese del 1999:Vägen ut – Breaking Out, del quale è possibile esista anche un remake americano.Il film francese parte da un attore in cattive acque – l'unico lavoro che sembra avere è insegnare l'haka maori a dirigenti e impiegati di qualche azienda, scena che fa ridere ma mette anche alquanta tristezza – che accetta di sostituire un collega nell'incarico di insegnare recitazione ai detenuti.Che sono cinque, poi diventano sei – ma uno lascia il posto a un altro.Il nostro attore si inventa dunque regista, pur non avendola mai fatto. Ma un po' di esperienza se l'è fatta lasciandosi dirigere da altri. E forse è arrivato il momento di togliersi qualche sassolino dalla scarpa.Capisce presto che l'occasione per fare qualcosa di diverso, di meritevole, di rimarchevole è ghiotta: e così, appena possible sostituisce il testo di studio e pratica, dalle favole di La Fontaine adAspettando Godot. Ottima scelta.Certo, conoscere il testo di Beckett aiuta: perché è più facile fare il collegamento tra i vagabondi del drammaturgo irlandese (errante proprio come il suo concittadino Joyce) e i detenuti, tra l'assurdità della vita di chi aspetta Godot – che non arriva mai, ed è più che probabile che chi lo aspetta, non lo conosca affatto, questo Godot – e l'assurdità della vita carceraria, che è basata sull'attesa. Attesa quotidiana: del pasto, dell'ora d'aria, delle visite, della posta. Attesa della fine della pena, attesa della liberazione.A ben guardare anche la ripetitività di gesti e parole della coppia di vagabondi Vladimiro ed Estragone rispecchia l'immobilità e reiterazione esasperata della vita dietro le sbarre.Il film francese m'è parso perfetto per come rispetta i canoni del genere (o, sottogenere). Per come sa toccare la giusta corda al momento giusto. Il cast è ottimo: nessuna star, tutti azzeccati, bravi e convincenti.Forse c'è un po' d'accumulo, un po' troppe vicende personali. Tutto il contrario dell'approccio scarno di Beckett, che probabilmente direbbe, Meno è meglio. Ma un palcoscenico è luogo diverso da uno schermo.Quando raccontarono a Beckett quello che era successo in Svezia, il premio Nobel fu contento e commentò che gli sembrava un finale perfetto.Il film svedese di Daniel Lind Lagerlöf (1999)."

Es una obra en la que no pasa nada y aún así pasa de todo.Beckett dio el puntapié inicial del \"Teatro del absurdo\" a partir de la puesta en escena de su obra al año siguiente de que fuera publicado su libro y nunca dejó de representarse en algún lugar del mundo.Eso es lo que sucede con las genialidades: llegan para quedarse y nunca desaparecen. Son eternas.El minimalismo y la austeridad de la obra que sólo posee dos actos y con apenas un árbol en escena además de los personajes, son suficientes para saber si Vladimiro y Estragón, que esperan a un tal Godot (vaya nombre interesante) lograrán encontrarlo, pero a su vez divierten al lector con sus ocurrencias y las acciones que se suceden junto a sólo tres personajes más, los increíbles Pozzo y Lucky y un muchacho, que aparece de vez en cuando.Los diálogos son cortos, ágiles y los personajes hacen reír al lector. Imagino que los actores en escena deben generar muchas más carcajadas. Una cosa es imaginarse la situación y otra es ver a los actores encarnando a Pozzo y Lucky tirando uno de una soga atada al otro.Realmente, es increíble como con tan pocos elementos puede un escritor lograr algo tan divertido y por sobre todo tan bien escrito (aunque le haya llevado casi un año terminar de escribir la obra).Como decía en mi reseña de Macbeth, no es el teatro uno de mis formas literarias predilectas pero cuando leo libros como este, tan brillantes, lo disfruto al máximo.\"Esperando a Godot\" es una obra de teatro en la que también nos encontraremos con dosis de existencialismo, descubrimos lo absurdo que solemos ser algunas veces los seres humanos, y para ello sólo basta con leer las reflexiones de Vladimiro o el alocado y único discurso de Lucky.En una escena Estragón dice:\"Todos nacemos locos. Algunos lo siguen siendo.\"Probablemente es esta una verdad en la que yo me incluiría (y que tal vez otros deberían considerarla)."

It is morning, the sun is shining, there is yet hope for us. We wait...for something or someone to diminish this boredom and loneliness, to give some meaning to what we call \"life\". We wait. The night falls. Everywhere is dark. There is nothing, everything is dead but a tree. We decide to end it all. But there is no rope to hang ourselves with! What if we wake up tomorrow and wait some more; hope some more? What if tomorrow would be different? If not, we can always bring a piece of rope with us the next time we go to the tree."

( بدون طرح به مفهوم بی داستان و نه بدون طرح کلی نمایش. چرا که در تمام نمونه های این سبک، طرح کلی موجود است.)نویسندگان این حوزه دو موضوع مهم را به صورت مشترک در آثار خود بیان می کنند:ناتوانی انسان در مراوده و تعامل معنی دار و اضمحلال فردیت.انسانی که به تصویر کشیده می شود انسانی است که فردیت خود را باخته و در نتیجه به طرزی منزوی و از خود بیگانه زندگی می کند یا با تکرار الگوی رفتاری غالب، هم رنگ شده با جماعت خود را از دست رفته می یابددر کائناتی که ناگهان همه توهمات و بارقه های امید ناپدید شده اند، انسان ناچارا احساس غریبگی می کند. وضعیت او به وضعیت فردی تبعید شده می ماند که هیچ علاجی برای دردهایش وجود ندارد، زیرا از خاطراتش درباره موطنی از دست رفته محروم است و ایضا امیدی هم به رسیدن به سرزمین موعود ندارد. این جدایی بین انسان و زندگی او، بین بازیگر و زمان و مکان نمایش، حقیقتا احسا�� معناباختگی را به وجود میاورد. کاموسقوط فردیت با از میان برداشتن تمایز میان شخصیت ها و جابجایی نقش ها در پایان نمایش نشان داده می شود. زبان در آثار ابزورد یاد آور اوهام و از هم گسیختگی دنیایی وهم انگیز است.زبانی که به کار گرفته می شود انزوای انسان در دنیا و ناتوانی وی از مراوده را نشان می دهد.بنا بر عقیده بکت،این ناتوانی از مراوده در نتیجه از زبان ناشی می شود،یعنی زبان خود مانع مراوده است.اما به زعم یونسکو انسان ها در مراوده ناتوانند چون در واقع چیزی برای مراوده ندارد.در نمایشنامه های ابزورد،هرگز چیزی روشن نمی شود،عملی صورت نمی پذیرد، هرگز پیامی منتقل نمی شود. بنا به گفته یونسکو نمایش ابزورد پیامی را تعلیم نمی دهد بلکه نوشته می شود تا تنها سخنی را مطرح کند\"در انتظار گودو\"در انتظار گودو فراخوانی پرشور برای نوعی ایمان جدید و از این منظر نمایشنامه ای بسیار دینی ست. مشکلی که در این نمایشنامه مطرح می شود یقینا ماهیتی مابعدالطبیعی دارد. چاره این موجودات حزن زده نه پیشرفت اقتصادی، سازگاری روانی و داروهایی که پزشکان تجویز می کنند، بلکه تعریفی جدید از انسان و رابطه ای جدید با عالم هستی است.انسانی که تا این حد محتاج معنویت است یا تعریف های کهنه شده از انسان و خدا را تجدید نظر خواهد کرد و یا اینکه به دنبال تعریف های جدید خواهد بود. کرنودلنمایش های بکت بیش از دیگر آثار ابزورد فاقد پی رنگ هستند. چند صدایی بودن نمایش به جای بسط خطی، تماشاگر را با ساختاری سازمان یافته از گزاره ها و تصاویر روبرو می کند، عبارات و تصویرهایی که در یکدیگر نفوذ می کنند و فقط در تمامیتشان است که می توان درکشان کرد، نه اینکه درون مایه هایی متفاوت اما هماهنگ باشند که با تعامل هم زمان ارائه ی معنا کنند.در انتظار گودو را می توان مهم ترین نماینده تئاتر ابزورد دانست. نمایشنامه 5 شخصیت دارد: ولادیمیر (دی دی) - استراگون (گوگو) - پوتزو - لاکی و پسربچه پیغام رسان. دو پرده این نمایش در مکان و زمان مشابهی اتفاق می افتد. درخت بیدی خشک،روی تلی کنار جاده ای بیرون شهر،دور افتاده و غریب. ولادیمیر و استراگون دو ولگرد هستند که روز را در انتظار گودو به شب می رسانند.گودو کیست؟ شخصیتی مرموز که هویت و وجودش هرگز فاش نمی شود، با این حال قرار است چیزی را برای ولادیمیر و استراگون به ارمغان آورد. اما این چیز چیست؟ مرگ؟ نجات؟ دلیلی برای بودن؟ ولادیمیر و استراگون خود فراموش کرده اند که چرا در انتظار گودو هستند. استراگون این دلیل را به خاطر نمی آورد و ولادیمیر با شک می گوید شاید یک لطف خواسته ایم، چیزی نامشخص، شاید یک دعا.در واقع استراگون و ولادیمیر منتظر گودو هستند تا با آمدنش جریان زمان را متوقف کند.\" امشب شاید تو جاش بخوابیم، یک جای گرم و نرم. شکممان سیر روی پوشال. می ارزد منتظرش باشیم، مگر نه؟\"البته این قسمت در متن انگلیسی حذف شده است.بکت در پاسخ آلن اشنایدر کارگردان اولین اجرای آمریکایی در انتظار گودو درباره شخصیت گودو گفته است:نمی دانم گودو کیست،اگر می دانستم که در نمایشنامه می گفتم.با این حال انگیزه های قوی بسیاری وجود دارد که ما را وسوسه می کند گودو را نمادی از خدا در نظر بگیریم. گودو هرگز خود را نشان نمی دهد،ریش بلند سفیدی دارد(بر اساس صحبت های ولادیمیر) ، پیغام رسانش کودکی چوپان است (اکثر پیامبران شبان گله بوده اند و با این تمثیل شناخته می شوند). پیغام رسان برادر دیگری دارد که گودو به خاطر دلایل نامعلوم با وی بد رفتار است.آیا بکت به هابیل و قائن و ماجرای نپذیرفته شدن هدایای قائن اشاره دارد؟ ولادیمیر و استراگون از گودو هراسان اند و در هر دو پرده هنگامی که تصور می کنند گودو در حال آمدن است هراسان شده و سعی در پنهان کردن خود می کنند. آیا این بخش اشاره به ترسان شدن آدم و حوا و پنهان شدن از خدا دارد؟ هنگامی که پوتزو در پرده اول با اقتدار وارد می شود هر دو ترسیده و وی را با گودو اشتباه می گیرند.به هر حال گودو چه اشاره به مداخله یک عامل ماورای طبیعی داشته باشد و چه نماینده انسانی اسطوره ای نجات دهنده ی موعود باشد، ماهیت او در درجه دوم اهمیت قرار دارد. موضوع نمایش شخص گودو نیست، بلکهکنش انتظار و معضل زمانبه عنوان جنبه ای خاص و اساسی از وضعیت بشری ست. ما در زندگی همیشه منتظر چیزی هستیم وگودو نشانگر غایت انتظار ماست و بس، یک شی، یک حادثه، یک فرد و یا مرگ. همچنین در انتظار است که ما کنش زمان را در ناب ترین و واضح ترین حالت خود تجربه می کنیم.تعدادی از جملات این نمایشنامه در دیگر آثار بکت نیز وجود دارند که مهم ترین آن، عبارت\"نمی دانم آقا\"ست که توسط پیغام رسان گودو بیان می شود.این عبارت در مولوی نیز تکرار می شود و شاید صدای آن تبهکاری ست که سال ها پیش بکت را مجروح کرده است. بکت در سال 1937 توسط یک زورگیر در خیابان به شدت مجروح می شود. ضارب پس از گرفتن کیف پول بکت، بی دلیل وی را با چند ضربه ی چاقو مجروح می کند. بکت پس از بهبود با ضارب خود در زاندان ملاقات می کند و از آن تبهکار می پرسد که چرا وی را جاقو زده و او پاسخ می دهد :نمی دانم آقابا آن که ولادیمیر و استراگون فردیت خود را از دست داده اند،اما می توان میان آن ها تمایزهایی اساسی در بررسی های دقیق تر قائل شد.می توان بر حسب الگوی نمایش ��ای کمدی، ولادیمیر و استراگون را شخصیت های قالبی \"مرد جدی و آقای کودن\" در نظر گرفت که مکمل یکدیگرند. در تمام تصمیم گیری ها،ولادیمیر نقش نهایی را دارد. این ولادیمیر است که گفتگو ها را آغاز می کند و به پیش می برد،اما استراگون در جواب حرف های بی معنی می زند و گفتگو قطع می شود. این ولادیمیر است که مرتبا متذکر می شود که آن ها باید منتظر گودو بمانند. اوست که از پسرک پیام رسان سوال می پرسد، فکر می کند و سخنانش گاهی چاشنی فلسفه دارد، به نیازهای جسمی خود و استراگون توجه می کند و اوست که از استراگون محافظت می نماید. در عوض استراگون مرتبا به امور معمولی توجه تام دارد.درد پا،مشکل پوتین ها، انتخاب هویج و نه جای شلغم، درخواست پول و استخوان های باقی مانده از پوتزو. می توان نتیجه گرفت استراگون شخصیتی دون مرتبه است و هیچ دل نگرانی دینی و فلسفی ای ندارد. با این حال تمام این تفاسیر تاثیری در رسیدن به نتیجه ( ملاقات با گودو) ندارد،آنان که در جستجوی معنا سخت در تلاشند، زودتر از کسانی که منفعلانه منتظر پیدا شدن معنا هستند به آن دست نمی یابند.استراگون و ولادیمیر هر دو درگیر محنت هستند. بکت به طور ضمنی به تعریف بعد فلسفی \"مسئله رنج\" پرداخته و میان وجهدرد کشیدنورنج بردنتمایز قائل شده است.استراگون از ناحیه پادرد می کشدو ولادیمیر بابت مشکلی در دفع ادراررنج می برد.حالت خوابیدن استراگون به صورت جنینی،تصویر بازگشت به رحم مادر و گریز از بودن را به تصویر می کشد (بنا به گفته ی گوگنهایم بکت خاطره ی وحشتناکی از زندگی در رحم مادر به یاد داشت. او مدام از این خاطره رنج می کشید و با به یاد آوردن این احساس که در حال خفه شدن بود مدام منقلب می شد) . سپس خوابی که استراگون می بیند و کلمه ای از آن را بیان می کند...سقوط... هبوط به این دنیای بی معنا؟دو شخصیت دیگر،پوتزو و لاکی بر خلاف استراگون و ولادیمیر، آنتی تز یکدیگرند اما در عین حال از طریق جسمانی و فراجسمانی با یکدیگر در ارتباط و اتصال اند.می توان آن ها را دو قطب متقاب�� در نظر گرفت.پدر در مقابل پسر، مادر در مقابل فرزند (طناب به منزله بند ناف)، ارباب در مقابل برده، دلقک سیرک در مقابل حیوان تربیت شده ( پوتزو وسایل سیرک شامل شلاق،چهارپایه،طناب و ... را در اختیار دارد، ورود آن ها مانند شروع یک نمایش مضحک سیرک است) و یا بر اساس نظریه فروید خود در مقابل نهاد.استراگون و ولادیمیر به وضوح برتر از پوتزو و لاکی هستند. نه به خاطر باورشان به گودو، بلکه چون به اندازه آن دو ساده لوح نیستند.آن ها به کنش،ثروت یا عقل اعتقادی ندارند. آنان آگاهند که همه آنچه در زندگی انجام می دهیم در مقابل کنش ذاتا توهم زمان، هیچ است. آگاهند که خودکشی می تواند بهترین راه حل باشد، بنابراین آن ها به لاکی و پوتزو برتری دارند چون کمتر خودمحورند و کمتر از آنان توهم دارند. اوا متمن،روانشناس یونگی بر این باور است کهکارکرد گودو این است که وابستگان به خودش را ناهشیار نگه دارد.از این دیدگاه امید و عادت به امیدواری که بعد از همه این ها ممکن است گودو بیایدآخرین توهمیاست که ولادیمیر و استراگون را از مواجهه با خودشان و موقعیت انسان باز می دارد. در لحظه آخر پیش از هوشیاری که چیزی نمانده ولادیمیر بفهمد در رویا بوده است و باید بیدار شود و با دنیا - همانطور که هست - روبرو شود، پیغام رسان گودو می رسد و دوباره او را به انفعال توهم می کشاند. بکت در مقاله ای در ارتباط با پروست،به طور ضمنی به این جنبه از در انتظار گودو یعنی \"عادت امید داشتن\" بیان می کند :عادت زنجیری است که سگ را به استفراغش می بندد، نفس کشیدن عادت است. زندگی عادت است یا ترجیحا توالی عادت هاست جون فرد در اثر تغییر پی در پی،توالی فرد هاست. پس عادت نام میثاق های بی شماری ست میان بی شمار سوژه که مجموعا فرد را می سازد و بی شمار ابژه وابسته شان. دوره های گذار که سازگاری های پی در پی فرد را از هم جدا می کند نمایانگر نواحی پر مخاطره ای در زندگی فرد است. پر خطر، بی ثبات، پر درد، پر راز و خلاق، وقتی لحظه ایرنج هستی جای ملال هستیرا می گیرد.گسنر در رساله ای خود درباره بکت عنوان می کند که در این اثر چهار شخصیت نمایش در مجموع 45 بار از وضعیت قائم که نماد شان انسانی ست خارج می شوند.شروع نمایشنامه در هر دو پرده با این عبارت است:کاری نمی شود کرد.این جمله به صورت های مختلف و در موقعیت های گوناگون در نمایش تکرار می شود و فضای کلی نمایش را مشخص می کند.قرار نیست در این نمایش کاری انجام شود و اتفاقی رخ دهد. ولادیمیر و استراگون هیچ کاری نمی کنند.در واقع آنان بی عملی را کم خطر ترین عمل ممکن یافته اند.مضمون دو دزد بر روی صلیب مضمون عدم قطعیت در امید به رستگاری و بخشوده شدن است، چیزی که بر تمام نمایش سایه افکنده است. هنگامی که از بکت در ارتباط با مضمون در انتظار گودو سوال شد وی چنین پاسخ داد: در نوشته های آگوستین قدیس جمله شگفت انگیزی هست، کاش لاتین آن را به یاد داشتم. به زبان لاتین حتی از زبان انگلیسی زیباتر است.\" ناامید نباشید،یکی از دو دزد رستگار شد. مطمئن نباشید، یکی از دو دزد به لعنت ابدی گرفتار شد.\"کاربرد نماد های مسیحی در نمایشنامه واضح است. کتک خوردن استراگون و خوابیدن در نهر یادآور مثلسامری نیکو* در عهد جدید است،با این تفاوت که دیگر نجات دهنده ای به داد استراگون نمی رسد. دو ولگرد در صحنه و تلی که بر آن درختی نیمه خشک قرار دارد و در حاشیه دورافتاده قرار گرفته است، می تواند یادآور وقایع جمعه الصلیب باشد (تلی بیرن از شهر = تپه جلجتا، دو ولگرد = دو دزد، چوب = صلیب، نماد رستگاری در بهار).ولادیمیر به آمدن گودو در آن شنبه موعود اشاره می کند.آیا امروز شنبه است؟ آیا این همان شنبه مابین جمعه الصلیب ** و یکشنبه رستاخیز است؟آن فضای خالی میان تاریخ؟ شنبه ای که با یاس، ترس حواریون، سکوت و غیبت خدا و انتظار همراه بود؟ بر خلاف کتاب مقدس در پایان این نمایش، تاریخ در همان شنبه ی سکون می ماند و هیچ یکشنبه رستگاری و قیامی در کار نیست.ولادیمیر و استراگون در حین مرور خاطرات،به افتادن در رودخانه و غرق شدن استراگون اشاره می کنند.این را نیز می توان اشاره ای به تعمید آب و تولد تازه در نظر گرفت. به کار بردن نام هابیل و قائن در نمایش،علاوه بر ارزش نمادین، نشان از جهان شمول بودن شخصیت های نمایش دارد.از میان تکنیک های خاصی که بکت در این نمایشنامه به کار گرفته است می توان به آشفته اندیشی زمان و مکان و مبتذل نشان دادن احساسات آدمی اشاره کرد(ولادیمیر و استراگون یکدگیر را در آغوش می گیرند،اما فورا به خاطر بوی سیر از یکدیگر فاصله می گیرند).در انتظار گودو مانند دیگر آثار ابزورد،ساختاری دورانی دارد. یکی بودن زمان و مکان در هر دو پرده،تکرار ریتمیک وقایع و تکرار شعر در ابتدای پرده دوم نشان از تسلسل باطل وقایع دارد. از شروع و پایان نمایشنامه مشخص است که تمام این وقایع با تفاوت اندکی در جزئیات،بارها و بارها تکرار شده و تکرار خواهند شد.بکت در این اثر یگانه نقطه قوت انسان نوین را به تصویر کشده است :انتظار!در انتظار...* - مثل سامری نیکو: روزي يكي از معلمين شريعت آمد و از راه امتحان از او پرسيد: «اي استاد، چه بايد بكنم تا وارث حيات جاودان شوم؟» عيسي به او فرمود: «در تورات چه نوشته شده؟ آن را چطور تفسير مي کني؟» او جواب داد: «خداي خود را با تمام دل و تمام جان و تمام قدرت و تمام ذهن خود دوست بدار و همسايه ات را مانند جان خود دوست بدار.» عيسي فرمود: «درست جواب دادي. اين كار را بكن كه حيات خواهي داشت.» اما او براي اينكه نشان دهد آدم بي غرضي است به عيسي گفت: «همسايه من كيست؟» عيسي چنين پاسخ داد: «مردي كه از اورشليم به اريحا مي رفت، به دست راهزنان افتاد. راهزنان او را لخت كردند و كتک زدند و به حال نيم مرده انداختند و رفتند. اتفاقا كاهني از همان راه مي گذشت، امّا وقتي او را ديد از طرف ديگر جاده رد شد. همچنين يک لاوي به آن محل رسيد و وقتي او را ديد از طرف ديگر عبور كرد. پس از آن يک مسافر سامري به او رسيد و وقتي او را ديد، دلش به حال او سوخت. نزد او رفت، زخمهايش را با شراب شست و بر آنها روغن ماليد و بست. بعد او را برداشته، سوار چهارپاي خود كرد و به كاروانسرايي برد و در آنجا از او پرستاري كرد. روز بعد دو سکه نقره درآورد و به صاحب كاروانسرا داد و گفت: 'از او مواظبت كن و اگر بيشتر از اين خرج كردي، وقتي برگردم به تو مي دهم.' به عقيده تو کدام يک از اين سه نفر همسايه آن مردي كه به دست دزدان افتاد به حساب مي آيد؟» جواب داد: «آن کسي که به او ترحم كرد.» عيسي فرمود: «برو مثل او رفتار كن.» لوقا 10 : 25 - 37** - جمعه ای که مسیح به صلیب کشیده شد"

        "user_review": "Bulgarian review below/Ревюто на български е по-долуIn many of the film scores which he composed, Hans Zimmer includes a ticking clock motif. In \"Dunkirk\" he even used the so-called Shepard tone – an auditory illusion whose pitch sounds like it is constantly ascending, although it remains the same. In his play Samuel Beckett also hangs an imaginary giant clock (perhaps on that same lonely tree where the characters want to hang themselves) to tick time away for Estragon and Vladimir, but gives up the suspense technique. There is no suspense. There also seems to be a vacuum of time, though we can clearly hear the ticking, which shows that time is actually passing. There is only endless waiting.\"Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!\"Beckett was inspired for his play from Caspar David Friedrich's painting \"Two Men Contemplating the Moon\". The sombre figures and the silhouette of the dead tree eerily contrast the golden moon in the distance. In the same way both V. and E. are constantly straining their eyes to see their shining moon on the horizon – their Godot – but what they lack is dynamics.\"The air is full of our cries\", says Vladimir.\"But habit is a great deadener\". And the habit of doing nothing when you are muffled by the long cold fingers of meaninglessness doesn't let its victims escape easily. In an interview,Maria Popovasays\"Critical thinking without hope is cynicism. Hope without critical thinking is naïveté\". V. and E. naively hope that their salvation will come from outside, not from themselves. That is why they are caught in the impossible vicious circle of waiting for someone to bring meaning to them, but the meaning in their existence is to wait for someone to bring meaning to them.\"We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the impression we exist?\"We humans are great specialists in giving ourselves the impression that we exist. Even to delude ourselves that the things we do are somewhat meaningful. We would have gone mad otherwise. Maybe we have?\"We are all born mad. Some remain so\". Godot is an allegory of what we all are waiting for. Probably also what we turn into while waiting. Perhaps the meaning is to search for meaning, not to expect it to come to you. Maybe there is no meaning. Where are you, Godot?Beckett's play is a representative of the theater of absurdity and its scrutiny of existentialism. Life is empty in anticipation of Godot, even communication is a broken wing of a bird, irrational, losing its own thread, a half-life. Samuel Beckett, who prefers\"France at war to Ireland at peace\", who, in his own words, writes because he's fit for nothing else, in his play expresses that mute frantic scream we would all emit if absurdists are really right. They suspect that existence has no meaning, but since this cannot be proven, we have the choice of committing suicide or not. Vladimir and Estragon also consider hanging themselves in a very matter-of-factly tone a few times.\"All evening we have struggled, unassisted.\"It's almost unbearable to be left to your own devices and your choices. Wondering whether to head for the unfamiliar, not knowing how dangerous it is or stay in the dreadful familiar whose degree of dreadfulness you already know. From an evolutionary point of view we are designed to place sure bets because there is always a swarm of bad things lurking in the dark. The unfamiliar is darkness. In fact, with the night approaching, V. and E. calm down, as if their trial is over for the day – night is a metaphor for death, and when you are dead, you are not expected to continue the painful search for meaning.\"Waiting for Godot\" is quite an abstract play which is subject to all sorts of interpretations. Beckett was annoyed by this and wondered why people try to complicate something that was otherwise so simple. A literary critic said that virtually nothing happens in the play. What is more, since Act II is almost a repetition of the Act I, then nothing happens twice. Will there be any point reading \"Waiting for Godot\" then? There will – because of the lifeless atmosphere that is a reflection of life – life is also very illogical at times, because of the irony and the fragments of pungent insight. And to search for a meaning for yourselves. Always for that.\"That's how it is on this bitch of an earth.\"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~В доста от филмите, за които е композирал музика, Ханс Цимер включва мотив с тиктакащ часовник. В \"Дюнкерк\" дори използва т.нар. тон на Шепард – звукова илюзия, при която ни се струва, че чуваното непрестанно се усилва, макар то да остава същото. В своята пиеса Самюел Бекет също обесва въображаем гигантски часовник (може би на онова самотно дърво, където и персонажите искат да се обесят), който отмерва времето за Естрагон и Владимир, но се отказва от похвата с нагнетяване на напрежението. Напрежение няма. Време също като че ли няма, въпреки че отчетливо чуваме цъкането, което показва как то всъщност си отива. Има само едно безконечно чакане.\"Нищо не се случва, никой не идва, никой не си отива, ужасна работа.\"Бекет се вдъхновил за написването на пиесата си от картината на Каспар Давид Фридрих \"Двама души, съзерцаващи луната\". Мрачните фигури и силуетът на мъртвото дърво леко зловещо контрастират на златистата луна в далечината. Така и В. и Е. непрестанно напрягат взор да видят своята грееща луна на хоризонта – своя Годо – но това, което им липсва, е динамика.\"Въздухът е пълен с нашите крясъци\", казва Владимир.\"Но навикът е голям заглушител\". А навикът да не правиш нищо, когато си скован от студените дълги пръсти на безсмислието, не пуска никак лесно жертвите си. В едно интервюМария Поповаказва, че критичното мислене без надежда е цинизъм, но надеждата без критично мислене е наивитет. В. и Е. наивно се надяват, че спасението им ще дойде някъде отвън, а не от тях самите. Затова са и хванати в невъзможния кръгов капан на това да очакват някой да им донесе смисъл, но смисълът на битието им да е да чакат някого, който да им донесе смисъл.\"Винаги намираме нещо, а, Диди, за да си даваме вид, че съществуваме, нали?\"Хората сме големи специалисти в това просто да си даваме вид, че съществуваме. Дори да се самозаблуждаваме, че нещата, които вършим, все пак имат някакво значение. Бихме полудели иначе. А може би сме?\"Всички се раждаме луди. Някои си остават\". Годо е алегория на онова, което всички чакаме. Вероятно и на това, в което се превръщаме, докато чакаме. Може би смисълът е да търсиш смисъл, не да го очакваш сам да дойде при теб. А може би го няма никакъв. Къде си, Годо?Пиесата на Бекет е представител на театъра на абсурда и неговото вглеждане в екзистенциализма. Животът е безсъдържателен в очакване на Годо, общуването дори е пречупено крило на птица, ирационално, губещо собствената си нишка, в период на полуразпад. Самюел Бекет, който предпочита\"Франция във война, отколкото Ирландия в мир\", който по негови думи пише, защото за друго не го бива, изразява в пиесата си онзи ням неистов вик, в който всички бихме зинали, ако абсурдистите наистина са прави. Те подозират, че смисъл да се съществува наистина няма, но тъй като това е непроверяемо, ни остава изборът дали да се самоубием или не. Владимир и Естрагон също обмислят обесване със съвсем делничен тон на няколко пъти.\"Цяла вечер се борихме, оставени сами на себе си.\"Почти непоносимо е да си оставен сам на себе си и на изборите си. Да се питаш дали да тръгнеш към непознатото, което не знаеш колко е страшно, или да останеш в ужасното познато, което все пак знаеш колко е страшно. От еволюционна гледна точка ни е заложено да играем на сигурно, защото в мрака винаги дебнат много лоши неща. Непознатото е мрак. Всъщност с наближаването на нощта В. и Е. се поуспокояват, все едно изпитанието им за деня е приключило – нощта е метафора на смъртта, а когато си мъртъв, от теб не се очаква мъчително да търсиш някакъв смисъл.\"В очакване на Годо\" е доста абстрактна пиеса, която е обект на какви ли не интерпретации. Бекет бил подразнен от това и се чудел защо хората се опитват да усложняват нещо, което иначе си е толкова просто. Един литературен критик казва, че в пиесата на практика нищо не се случва. Нещо повече – тъй като второ действие е почти повторение на първо, то нищо не се случва два пъти. Ще има ли защо да прочетете \"Годо\" тогава? Ще има – заради безжизнената атмосфера, която е отражение на живота – защото и в него невинаги има логика, заради иронията и откъслеците хапливи прозрения. И за да потърсите и вие смисъла. Винаги заради това.\"Такива ми ти работи на тая тъпа земя.\""

However, since its completion, the comedy ofWaiting for Godothas become commonplace. Because the humor could be said to be Three Stooges-esque at times, one could say this play was even behind the times. I say itcouldbe said, not that I say it is.DoesWaiting for Godotdeserve all the attention it has received? After all, it seems to state the meaning of life while asserting life is meaningless, and that's quite a significant statement. From the mouths of the characters Vladimir and Estragon, Beckett says that nothing in life matters. However, the characters contempt suicide, and that is the ultimate matter of life. That they then neglect to do so would indicate that they believe there to be value in life. Or is it that they are just too lazy to do even this deed, which would release they from having to do anything afterwards forever and always?Ah, but look at me, foolishly trying to make sense of it all when, if anything is clear, that is surely not what Beckett intended.Instead, let me explain why this received no better than a middling rating from me. It has too many Falstaffs. When everybody's a comedian real conversation turns into a comedian's lingua franca and much of the humor's basis of being funny in the first place is lost. In other words, we laugh at the absurdity of life, but if life is absurd the humor dissipates. InWaiting for Godotthe humor dissipated too much for me. There, I said it."

If you ask me which are the most valuable books I have, the answer will definitely have the first edition of all the Harry Potter books.This book deals with five fairy tales related to the magical world. The additional notes given by Professor Albus Dumbledore will provide you with a unique reading experience. My favorite, like many other readers, is the tale of three brothers, which was mentioned in Deathly hallows\"The quest for the elder wand nearly supports an observation I have had occasion to make many times in the course of my life that humans have the knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\""

Though, makes sense from her surname.(2) They went all-out for this audiobook: a full cast narration, music and sound effects.09/22/2023 (3)- Second Half(1) The last half of the book has two stories, \"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\" and \"The Tale of the Three Brothers.\"- \"Babbitty Rabbitty\" is sort of a wizard version of \"The Emperor's New Clothes.\"- \"The Three Brothers\" is up there with \"Fountain of Fair Fortune\" as the two best stories here.(2) Overall, even the two standouts aren't all that special, it's just fun revisiting the wizarding world."

And muggle Arianna, my daughter, cannot but appreciate the umpteenth bedtime reading on the Rowling's universe. In fact, she listens carefully, wide-eyed, then she giggles, then she gets serious, again she laughs heartily, and so on. In short: the perfect goodnight.\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" tale deserves a special mention. It is a quite criticised story by the magical community, due to its bottom line in favour of the muggles. A father teach a lesson to his son, preaching love and tolerance for un-magic people, the muggles, that is to say... ourselves, the readers.And I, muggle for many generations, am so jaelous of all the un-muggles. Damn!Vote: 7,5«C'era una volta un vecchio mago gentile che adoperava la magia con generosità e saggezza a beneficio dei suoi vicini»Direttamente dalla Biblioteca di Hogwarts, commentate nientemeno che dal Professor Silente, arriva una raccolta di storie per giovani maghi e streghe, l'equivalente delle fiabe babbane per bimbi babbani (ossia per bambini non magici). E la babbana Arianna, mia figlia, non può non apprezzare questa ennesima lettura serale sull'universo narrativo della Rowling. E difatti ascolta con attenzione, occhi sgranati, poi sghignazza, poi si fa seria, poi di nuovo ride di cuore, e così via. La buonanotte perfetta.Menzione speciale merita la fiaba \"Il mago e il pentolone salterino\", racconto piuttosto criticato dalla comunità magica per via della morale pro-babbana in esso contenuta. In questa fiaba infatti si predica, attraverso una lezione che impartisce un padre al proprio figlio, amore e tolleranza verso il popolo non magico, i babbani, vale a dire... noi, i lettori.Ed io, babbano da svariate generazioni, provo invidia per tutti i non-babbani. Mannaggia!Voto: 7,5"

I fucking loved it. The stories were a mix of wonder and darkness, of hope and love, and the extra notes from both Dumbledore and Jo were the perfect addition to this wonderful little book. I only wish there were more stories! What a gem!"

        "user_review": "This didn't work at all for me. It felt too gimmicky. It felt like it was trying too hard to be part of wizarding universe rather than actually being part of it. Dumbledore's notes were here in an attempt to guide the reader though in actual fact they just made the experience much worse. They felt more patronising than anything really.That being said, it's a fun attempt to create a foundation for Rowling's already vast and complex fantasy world. But I don't think it needs it. If you look at Tolkien andThe Silmarillion,that book actually added something to middle earth. It builds upon the groundwork and explores the full history of the writing. It gives you so much more detail. Granted, this is an altogether different creature, but I don't think it adds much to the wizarding world. There are glimpses of this book through the full Harry Potter series, and we hear about its nature, but I don't think seeing it here changes much.If anything, my perceptions of the book are lessoned because it just didn't live up to expectations. It's supposed to be this legendary book containing dark stories perhaps a bit similar to Grimm's fairy tales in the real world. Generations and generations of wizards have read it and it is always raved about by the characters. It's supposed to be something fantastic, and it's not. It's a book of very, very, basic stories that do not have the ability to stand on their own feet. It cannot be read in isolation from the main work and it is terribly short lacking any sense of substance or literary merit.All in all, it's a book written for the strongest of Harry Potter fans. I love the series too, but because of this it doesn't mean this book is automatically going to receive my admiration. It's a good idea, though it is very poorly executed."

How can I not love an alleged children's writer who mentions murder, mutilation, cannibalism, adultery, and bestiality all within the span of 110 (ultra-short) pages? The stories are on the meh side, but Dumbledore's commentaries showed a smart, literary eye that reminded me briefly of Pale Fire. I'm all, \"Hey, JK, you did your thang.\" Be that as it may, I'm a bit offended by the Dumbledore's anti-anti-Muggle bias. I see nothing wrong with witches and wizards not wanting to associate with Muggles. I hate Muggles, they are the worst! And I have Muggle heritage myself (but don't tell anyone I said that, EEW EEW EEW!) so you know I can't be magicist. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I think, \"Go back to where you came from, Mudblood!\" So I did -- but the staff at New York Presbyterian wouldn't take me back."

I absolutely loved these stories, as well as Dumbledore's commentary. I learned some new things, and connected a few others. They were such a phenomenal addition to the books, especially Deathly Hallows. I will forever love The Tale of the Three Brothers, and it will always be a classic tale for me. I can't believe how much effort J.K. Rowling put into every single aspect of her series, just to make it that much more wonderful. I love how she wove magic into five completely different stories of her own making. This takes so much time, effort, and devotion and I will forever be grateful for all the love that she puts into her books. I will continue to reread these lovely tales whenever I need a little magic in my life. Hopefully in the future I will also read these to my children along with the Harry Potter series. Every addition to this amazing series brings me so much joy and I can't say enough good things. I highly recommend giving these a read! You won't be disappointed! She gave it her all and I could never give this less than 5 stars!"

It is their hardship and their tenderness that led them to gain what they wished for. The stories are not just stories. If you go by Dumbledore's notes and analysis, they'll relate you to Harry Potter books more and their teaching methods.It was a constant jump from fables to rational thinking that Dumbledore described. A great book to have in a Potterhead's collection, containing the stories that every child who wants to perform magic must be aware of."

It goes something like this: these tales were written by a wizard, by the name of Beedle, some centuries ago; they have been used as bedtime stories by generations of witches and wizards ever since; this volume is a translation from the original text, carried out by none other than Hermione Granger (Harry Potter's friend); also, the book includes a commentary for each of the tales, written by Albus Dumbledore (Hogwarts School's headmaster) himself; the footnotes only are by J.K. Rowling. And, last but not least, these tales (especially the last one) are mentioned in the previous book of theHarry Potterseries and reveal the origin of the Deathly Hallows.This device gives a fantastic sense of complexity and reality to these tales. But what is perhaps more touching are the moral commentaries, which address the topics of charity and cooperation, friendship and love, human foolishness, and death.The copy I own is a lovely, ancient-looking, limited edition facsimile, with silver-coloured pieces on the cover of the original handwritten and illustrated text that was initially sold at the flabbergasting price of £2 million to Amazon, through a charity auction."

I loved the connection this book establishes with the main frame of the story. The tale of three brothers and death no doubt was heard and was fabulous.What made the book immersing was the moral giving stories that fills the young magical mind with the essence of good and bad. The teachings and controversies drawn from the interpretations are no different than the muggle world.Books are banned, content is censored! Humor laden analogy is a JKR signature.My favorite part has to be the message scribbled by Dumbledore himself at the end of every story.The hopping pot instills you with the ideology that you must help others if you can. The message is loud and clear - face the consequences should you go immoral.Laced with emotions and selfless love are the stories of three women who seek redemption.Though,Babbity Rabbitytakes the cake with her wit smacked aura.Verdict: Future schedule - reading this to my children pretending ourselves to be James and Lily Potter."

Upon my arrival to the inside of the store, I saw a table decorated with a single blue balloon, and a plastic tablecloth. Taped across the front of the small buffet table was a sign that said \"Join us at 12:01 for Tales of Beedle the Bard!\" Needless to say, I squealed aloud with delight, and my best friend blushed with embarrassment at being seen in public with a squealing Harry Potter fan. I could hardly believe that I had forgotten the realease date for the storybook Harry Potter fans everywhere were waiting for! Of course, I searched frantically for my wallet, but it was nowhere to be found, lost in the abyss that is my purse. As I began to walk away with my head hung low, Kristen, the dearest friend I've ever known, then took me by the hand and led me back to the table. She told me that she would buy me the book as an early Christmas present, but I had to promise to love it. And that very night, after I had finished the book, my promise was kept, and I loved it."

Der Inhalt des Buches besteht aus 5 Märchen, an deren Ende jeweils ein Kommentar von Albus Dumbledore folgt. Am besten hat mir natürlich das Märchen von den drei Brüdern gefallen, welches man ja auch schon aus den Filmen kennt (hat es noch jemand außer mir in Hermines Stimme gelesen?!) Für alle Potterheads einfach ein Must-read, welches auch einfach sehr hübsch aufgemacht ist und im Bücherregal nicht fehlen darf!"

        "user_review": "I'm having a hard time deciding which is my favorite tale, but I'd lean towards The Fountain of Fair Fortune, with the The Warlock's Hairy Heart coming in a close second (if only it had been executed a little better!).Keeping in mind that these are wizarding fairy tales, with commentary by Dumbledore and translated by Hermione (oh MAN, wouldn't it be awesome to get into a crazy discussion about Hermione as a biased translator? Dumbledore's comments are obviously 100% biased) - the book is really quite cute. It shouldn't take you much more than 30 minutes to read it but I was expecting a short read(and honestly, my #1 complaint is the binding -t he book just feels awkward, and I am dreading when the spine is obviously cracked open).Spoilers start here:Tale #1: The Wizard and the Hopping Pot: The most obvious morality tale in the book. A young man inherits his father's cauldron and his father's requests for aid from needy (but humble & worthy!) Muggle neighbors, resists with an attitude, and is taught a lesson in charity. I found Dumbledore's notes more interesting than the tale itself.Tale #2: The Fountain of Fair Fortune: Almost a Wizard of Oz-type story; a Muggle Knight and 3 witches quest for their greatest wish to be granted at the Fountain of Fair Fortune, but end up solving their problems on the journey. I really think JKR could have expanded this out into much more of a short story, although it does make sense in the fable/fairy tale format. Really quite cute, and the \"happiest\" of the bunch.Tale #3: The Wizard's Hairy Heart: Obviously the darkest tale; a man turns to the Dark Arts and cuts himself off from enjoying life by literally taking his beating heart out of his chest so he will never be hurt. Dumbledore's notes sort of point towards the ZOMG TERRIBLE HORCRUX IS TERRIBLE idea, but never outright says, so this Tom Riddle kid TOTALLY ate this one up at the Muggle orphanage--OH WAIT, HE TOTALLY DIDN'T.Tale #4: Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump: A really stupid Muggle king wants to wipe out witches and wizards, gets scammed by a con man, but his dishwasher is a real witch and not only stops the persecution but even gets a gold statue through her own cunning. I think this was my least favorite out of the 5.Tale #5: The Tale of the Three Brothers: We know this one from Deathly Hallows, but 3 brothers run into Death, get the Elder Wand, the resurrection stone thing, and the Invisibility Cloak. Brothers 1 and 2 are totally dumb and die pretty quickly, but Brother 3 knows meeting Death is inevitable, but hides and lives into old age. Again, Dumbledore's notes are very vague, and full of, NOW, THIS WAND/STONE BUSINESS IS TOTALLY FOLKLORE (also, can I just say how much the term Deathstick amuses me to no end??) BUT INVISIBILITY CLOAKS RUUUULE.Overall, it's sort of cool to think how these tales might have played into the upbringing of some of the characters. The Weasley kids probably heard all of these 10 million times.Oh, AND! I forgot, my favorite part is when \"Dumbledore\" goes into as close as he can get into a rant about censorship concerning the content of the tales (the Malfoys across the ages are big into banning books). It's even more funny considering HP's history, and the fact that JKR was nice enough to let Dumbledore give the gentle smackdown."

The five fairy tales are all interesting in their own right and then the critiques by Albus Dumbledore are delightful. It was interesting to note that part of the proceeds of the sale of this book went to a children's charity. That is pleasing.I am glad I eventually got around to reading it and can now pop it back on the shelf next to the complete set of Harry Potter."

Ova priča je u čarobnjačkom svetu toliko jaka i važna da je iz nje proistekla najveća znana legenda - onaj čarobnjak ili veštica koji uspe da objedini sve tri relikvije smrti postaće nepobediv, a relikvije su ništa drugo do predmeti koje je Smrt dala braći na poklon nakon što su je prevarili.Odmah moram napomenuti komentare koje ostavlja Albus Dambldor nakon svake od ovih priča, dajući im novu dimenziju i pobliže nam predstavljajući ne samo čarobnja��ki svet, već i način na koji funkcioniše svaka osoba, bila ona normalac ili čarobnjak. Za mene su ti komentari možda i najbolji deo knjige, uz simpatičnu opasku da nijedna veštica zapravo nije pokušala da objedini sve tri relikvije smrti.Pored pomenute \"Priče o Tri brata\", tu su još četiri priče: \"Čarobnjak i skakućući lonac\", \"Vrelo velike sreće\", \"Veščevo kosmato srce\" i \"Baka-zekonja i njen Cerekajući panj\". Svaka je dragocena i poučna, a ujedno propraćena već pomenutim komentarima. Volela bih da izdvojim \"Vrelo velike sreće\" jer je kroz avanturu tri veštice i normalskog viteza odlično prikazana činjenica da smo mi sami tvorci svoje sreće i da nema te magije koja nam može pomoći ukoliko ne pomognemo mi sami sebi.Više nego toplu preporuku bih dala i audio verziji ovih priča koje su svojevremeno na mene ostavile izuzetan utisak."

Rowling uses double spacing, huge margins and mediocre pencil art (that she drew) to stretch out what should have been some short stories published on the internet, a magazine, or saved for inclusion in a bigger book. The tales are all very concise, you can tell she tries hard to make them deep and classical, but they fall short, and most fail to draw you in or make you interested. After each story is a boring (almost arrogant) review by Dumbledore, who tries to convince you how great and meaningful they are. The longest story in the book, about the brothers involved with the Deathly Hallows, is just repeated word for word from the last book in the Harry Potter series. You will glean a few tiny tidbits of information you never knew about some of the unimportant characters from the series (such as Sir Nicholas the Ghost), but otherwise this 'book' will be forgotten. A shame since I loved the main series."

        "user_review": "The book jacket tells us that this was the first book (published 1967) that introduced Jewish culture to a wide American audience.The story centers around two boys growing up in the Jewish neighborhood of Williamsburg in Brooklyn in New York City of the 1940's. The main character is a high-school aged boy who lost his mother years ago and is raised by his father, a teacher at a Jewish school, and a housekeeper. They are devout Orthodox Jews.Due to a baseball injury, he makes friends with another devout Jewish boy who is a Hasidic Jew, destined to inherit his father's position as a rebbe (tzaddik). The boy is so exceptional – the main character's father says he has a mind that is seen once in a generation -- that the father encourages him to befriend the boy. Both boys are exceptional scholars. In addition to going to school from 6 am to 6 pm and then coming home to do hours of homework they manage to read 3 or 4 books of outside reading each week. The Hasidic rebbe raises his son \"in silence\" – never talking to him outside the context of Torah lessons.We follow the two boys through various troubles. World War II enters into the story. As the boy recovers from his sports injury to his eye in the hospital, he listens to radio news about the D-Day landing. The war ends in 1945, news of the horrors of the Holocaust is absorbed by the community, and shortly after (1947) Israel is founded. The main character's father becomes a fund-raiser and a political advocate supporting the establishment of the Jewish state. This causes a rift between the boys because some members of the Hassidic community thought it was blasphemy to re-establish Israel prior to the coming of the Messiah.Interspersed with the plot, the book gives us details of other differences between Orthodox Jews and Hasidic Jews. The latter culture grew out of the Eastern European Jewish tradition (Ashkenazi) after the mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against the Jews, known as the Chmielnicki uprising. This took place in Poland in the 1600's.The community was so devastated (100,000 killed) that its faith was impacted. False messiahs and mysticism appeared (which generated the Kabballah). Non-sensical scholarship (pilpul, which reminds me of 'how many angels on the head of a pin' in the Christian tradition) was pursued by some. The tzaddiks evolved – rebbes of inherited position who are so revered that their followers want to touch them. Another permutation of the faith was gematria – assigning numerical values to letters and words in the Torah and searching for multiple meanings through what outsiders would call numerology.We follow the boys as they mature, and they don't necessarily fall into the paths expected of them.This is a good read. The author does a good job of interspersing the cultural and historical details into the narrative so that it remains a novel, not a sociological text. (I should add that many of the words I've used in this review have alternate spellings from those used in the edition I read.)photo of Chasidim in Williamsburg from vosizneias.com"

Il racconto continua ancora per qualche anno (dal1944 al 1948), porta i due ragazzi dal liceo al college, la Palestina diventa Stato di Israele (della Nakba neanche un accenno)…Meglio prepararsi a lunghi squarci di argomenti di cultura varia, dalla matematica alla storia alla filosofia.E meglio prepararsi a non incontrare donne: le poche che compaiono sono appena più che tappezzeria, e probabilmente la più presente è la governante a mezzo servizio di casa di Reuven, figlio unico e orfano di madre. Il mondo è degli uomini: padri e figli maschi.Il finale scatena commozione, credo sia difficile evitarla.Danny l'eletto."

To my surprise, I quite enjoyed reading this as it immersed me in a world of logical reasoning and critical thinking, which to me have always seemed incompatible with the study of any religious texts, without losing your faith.Zionism is also a theme the book touches upon, in particular the radically different views within the Jewish communities.The story is told in a rather straightforward style, and has a sad tone throughout. I believe it were this tone and writing style that prevented me from really loving the book, although it's not always clear why I liked a book, but didn't love it.The book immerses the reader not only in a fundamentalist atmosphere, but also in a man's world, in which women are almost totally absent. This book at least offers women a glimpse in these men's peculiar world.\"You ought to get yourself a girl, it's a wonderful tonic for a suffering soul\"This was by far the best advice Reuven gave to his friend Danny.7/10"

        "user_review": "Danny Saunders was raised in silence to save his soul. His father saw that his mind was so keen that his soul would be lost if there was not some awful tragedy to break his soul into a living space. So his father raised him in silence, never speaking to him until Danny learned to listen to that silence, to hear in the silence the cry of millions of his people as they were slaughtered, starved, beaten, and experimented upon by Hilter's army. It did not make Danny a rabbi, but it saved his soul in the end. It gave him the ears of a psychologist as he could listen to that silence.As I read this, I kept thinking about how God has raised us in silence. We are only allowed communication with him in certain ways, through rituals, through scripture. All else is silence. In this silence, we long for a closer relationship. We suffer. We hold respect for God and the methods used for communication. And in that silence, we hear the suffering of the world, of each child that dies every five seconds of hunger. We hear that silence, and, I hope, it gives us a heart."

        "user_review": "Chaim Potok's 1967 novel,The Chosen, mostly set during WWII, is a fascinating study of two families, linked by ethnic roots, religion & geography but still held at a considerable distance from each other.At the center of the novel are Danny Saunders & Reuven Malther, both Orthodox Jewish boys of the same age living in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, a very diverse, polyglot area of New York but with intensely self-contained pockets of families defined in critical ways by the specific synagogue or church they attend.And what could be a more democratic, all-American way to bring the two lads together than the game of baseball, except that these two teams seem to taunt one another from the sidelines, with Danny's ultra-Orthodox, Hasidic team regarding their somewhat less Orthodox opponents as only marginally Jewish, calling themapicorsimor apostate Jews & as such, a threat to their way of regarding the world, marked by a much stricter code of dress, behavior & interpretation of the Talmud, the foundational book of Judaism.The Hasidic team also speaks Yiddish rather than English, being far more protective of their particular way of life in a country that seems to pride itself on the erasure of formal differences. But when Reuven pitches & is struck by a batted baseball hit by Danny, breaking Reuven's glasses & imperiling his eye with broken glass, the two boys become rather dramatically connected in what will eventually become a lifelong bond.Both Danny & Reuven are gifted students, attending the same school but different synagogues & yet both boys are driven to expand their own quite separate universes, with a public library being another point of commonality for them. As Danny delves into Freud & psychology, Reuven keenly explores symbolic logic.Throughout the novel, while both Danny & Reuven study the Talmud to the exclusion of most everything else, for both boys are the sons of rabbis & expected to follow their fathers in that path, Reuven is given far greater flexibility to expand his mind, while Danny is very circumscribed by Hasidism & its traditions, including having had his wife chosen for him ages ago.Added to that, Danny's father is atzaddik, an exceedingly righteous spiritual leader, from many generations of such rabbis, afforded great authority & almost magical powers within his Hasidic congregation. As the bond grows between the boys after Reuven forgives Danny for seeming to intentionally injure him with a batted baseball, they discuss their dreams, with Danny's future much more rigidly defined...I have no choice. It's like a dynasty & if the son doesn't take his father's place, the dynasty falls apart. My family has been our Hasidic people's rabbi for 6 generations & I can't just walk out on them now. I'm a little trapped. Danny turned away from the window & began to play with his earlock (braided hair), caressing it & twirling it with his index finger.Then he shook his head & declared that the world was a crazy place because while Reuven doesn't have to be a rabbi but wants to be one, Danny has to become a rabbi but doesn't want to be one.Throughout the novel, Reuven's father is a source of consolation & guidance for his son, while Danny's father is marked by rigidity, only willing to speak with his son about the Talmud. Nevertheless, the two boys continue to share confidences & to support each other, at least until they are midway through a Brooklyn rabbinic college that also allows courses in science, with the Talmud studied from 9 until 3 & the afternoon devoted to \"secular\" courses.There is a very memorable scene inside Danny's synagogue, with his father, Rebe Saunders, avidly testing his son & rabbi-in-training on the Talmud in the midst of the congregation, with Reuven having been invited to attend the evening gathering but feeling rather like an alien in their presence.The sense of distance was palpable for Reuven, especially with the male members having blocked the steps to the synagogue, allowing him to enter only because Danny took his arm, causing the other Hasidic members to part in a wave, almost akin to the Red Sea suddenly allowing a pathway.However, after WWII & the extent of the Holocaust comes to light, the issue of the creation of the state of Israel causes the 2 families to come to an impasse, with Reuven's father manifestly Zionist and Danny's father contending that there can be no Israel until the Messiah comes to lead the Jewish nation, not a secular leader, a \"Jewish goy\" like Ben Gurion. At this point, Danny is forbidden to even speak to Reuven.The Chosenis a tightly-paced, wonderfully sensitive novel about both transitions & transformations that are at times subtle & at other times almost revolutionary for the two boys, as well as their families. Additionally, it is a novel that speaks of the importance of forgiveness & reconciliation.And it also considers the value of silence, as when Danny confides in Reuven, bewildering his friend by stating that, unlike other rabbis, the role of atzaddikis to know how to silently carry the weight of pain on his shoulders, embodying the suffering of his people...There's more truth in this than you realize. You must learn to listen to silence, Reuven. I've begun to realize that you can listen to silence & learn from it. It has a quality & a dimension all its own. It talks to me sometimes. I feel myself alive in it. It talks & has a strange, beautiful texture. Sometimes it cries & you can hear the pain of the world in it. It hurts to listen to it then. But you have to.I won't in any way reveal howThe Chosenconcludes but Chaim Potok's deeply expressive & highly recommended novel points to the importance of tradition but also the need for children to be allowed to create their own narratives in life, sometimes quite at odds with the ones their parents envision, a very American book but one with qualities that seem universal.*While I was previously aware of the novel, it was especially recommended by Prof. Barry Wimpfheimer as a part of an Adult Education course on the Talmud that I recently took part in at Northwestern University. And in some very important ways, the novel seems to parallel some aspects of Prof. Wimpfheimer's life, as shared with his class.**Photo images within the review include the author, Chaim Potok; 2 Jewish lads in the midst of a baseball game (one Hasidic, the other not); & lastly, Hasidic schoolboys in Brooklyn."

        "user_review": "The Jewish Talmud exhorts a man to do two things for himself. First, acquire a teacher. The other is to choose a friend.Danny Saunders got the package deal when he made the acquaintance of Reuven Malter. Theirs is a Jonathan and David friendship, the two-bodies-with-one-soul type of friendship that happens rarely in a lifetime.As the oldest son of the tzaddik (righteous leader) of a strict, Hasidic Jewish sect, Danny is the chosen. Upon the death of his father, he will be expected to step up as head of the dynasty. Thus his father, the brilliant but eccentric Reb Saunders, focuses his full attention upon the proper upbringing of his son.But what is a proper upbringing for a genius? Listen to the agonizing dilemma of Danny's father:\"A man is born into this world with only a tiny spark of goodness in him. The spark is God, it is the soul; the rest is ugliness and evil, a shell. The spark must be guarded like a treasure, it must be nurtured, it must be fanned into flame. {Snip} Anything can be a shell....anything. Indifference, laziness, brutality, and genius. Yes, even a great mind can be a shell and choke the spark.Reuven, the Master of the Universe blessed me with a brilliant son. And he cursed me with all the problems of raising him. Ah, what it is to have a brilliant son! Not a smart son, Reuven, but a brilliant son, a Daniel, a boy with a mind like a jewel. Ah, what a curse it is, what an anguish it is to have a Daniel, whose mind is like a pearl, like a sun. Reuven, when my Daniel was four years old, I saw him reading a story from a book. And I was frightened. he did not read the story, he swallowed it, as one swallows food or water. There was no soul in my four-year-old Daniel, there was only his mind. He was a mind in a body without a soul. It was a story in a Yiddish book about a poor Jew and his struggles to get to Eretz Yisroel before he died. Ah, how that man suffered! And my Daniel enjoyed the story, he enjoyed the last terrible page, because when he finished it he realized for the first time what a memory he had. He looked at me proudly and told me back the story from memory, and I cried inside my heart. I went away and cried to the Master of the Universe, 'What have you done to me? A mind like this I need for a son? A heart I need for a son, a soul I need for a son, compassion I want from my son, righteousness, mercy, strength to suffer and carry pain, that I want from my son, not a mind without a soul!\"Reb Saunders makes a very unusual choice for his son. He chooses to raise him in silence. Except for weekly dialogue over the Talmud and Torah, no words pass between father and son. Though it seems cruel, it is the father's best hope that the suffering it creates will fan into flame that spark of a soul that lies within Danny.Reuven becomes the counter-balance for Danny's relationship with his father. As a more liberal Jew, Reuven is able to bring a rational element into an otherwise emotionally volatile situation. Without their friendship, it is easy to see that Danny would crumple either from rage or simply from the heavy load of expectation he carries as a burden.Ultimately, Reb Saunders can claim at least partial victory for his son's upbringing. Danny will break the the multi-generational traditions of his ancestors; he will not step into the chosen role of Tzaddik. Rather, he will be a \"tzaddik for the world\", a different kind of a healer in his chosen field of psychology. But he will remain a practicing Jew, a man with a soul in whom the spark of life burns brightly.I loved this book. It was fascinating to look behind the scenes at the traditions of the most orthodox sect of Judaism. The Jews have remained a people apart, separate from the nations. This story gives a glimpse of the challenges they incurred as a people group after WWII. The struggle was to keep their traditions intact, but at the same time to acclimate to their new home country of America. Rich, rich, rich. I have scouted out two others by the same author The Promise, which is a sequel to The Chosen, and My Name is Asher Lev, which some feel is Chaim Potok's best work."

Vi è però molto di più : il rapporto di due figli coi rispettivi padri; il fronteggiarsi di due diverse concezioni e tradizioni pur all'interno della stessa religione ebraica...Le vicende si svolgono a New York, nel quartiere dove gli ebrei immigrati dall'Europa hanno ricostituito le loro comunità.Il periodo è compreso tra gli ultimi anni della Seconda Guerra Mondiale e i fatti successivi alla proclamazione dello Stato di Israele nel '48. Il momento storico è cruciale: l'olocausto in Europa; la comunità ebraica in America che si sente l'unica rimasta indenne, quindi responsabile di rappresentare anche chi non c'è più. Poi il Movimento sionista per la riedificazione di uno Stato ebraico in zona mediorientale, con il fronteggiarsi di due diverse posizioni: chi agisce a favore del progetto e chi vi si oppone per il timore, in caso di riuscita, di una gestione ormai non in linea con le tradizioni originarie ma protesa ad una mentalità sostanzialmente laica, 'americanizzata' .La parte preponderante del libro, e comunque sempre presente, riguarda però l'aspetto relazionale/affettivo : Potok delinea grandi figure di padri, per i quali l'educazione dei figli è questione di rilevantissima importanza. Aleggia poi fra le pagine un grande senso di rispetto per le opinioni altrui e soprattutto per chi le esprime. Si vive con forti valori (\"L'uomo deve colmare la sua vita di significato\") ; c'è poi una tensione all'approfondimento capace di sorprendere chi mentalmente avesse già emesso giudizi stando alla superficie delle questioni. Lezioni di vita anche per chi, come noi, si sente distante da quel mondo rappresentato.Il libro presenta una struttura a cui solo le opere grandissime possono aspirare : nulla di troppo, nulla di troppo poco. In più si respira un'atmosfera di accoglienza che consola e dà speranza : anche il dolore talvolta può essere un percorso necessario di crescita.Si tratta di un testo per certi aspetti sapienziale, da cui si esce arricchiti e maggiormente riconciliati con se stessi e con gli altri.E' importante sapere che le vicende proseguono in un libro successivo almeno altrettanto bello : \"La scelta di Rewen\"."

It is a story of the friendship between two very different Jewish boys growing up in Brooklyn. It is also a story of the relationships between fathers and sons. Although the story is fictional, it provides an introduction to the history of Jews in Europe and even briefly touches on the very early days of the modern state of Israel.It is a story and a book that I shall never forget."

        "user_review": "Note, July 9, 2023: I've just edited this review slightly, to correct a typo.Over time, as I remember books I've read and continue to reflect on them, they sometimes rise or sink in my estimation. This one has steadily risen since I first reviewed it, and I've accordingly awarded it a fifth star.The central theme ofThe Chosenis the possible difference between our inherited religious tradition vs. the genuine will of God for our lives; and its central moral question is, how far (if at all) do we have an obligation to let the former define who we can become? Both boys in the book have to grapple with this; it's most obvious for Danny, \"chosen\" from infancy to succeed his father as a rabbi of the super-orthodox Hasidim, with their almost medieval traditions (a role he's not at all cut out for), but Reuven also faces it in his yeshiva, when he realizes that his own study of the Old Testament leads at times to different conclusions than those of his rabbinic tradition. Himself Jewish, Potok doesn't demonize tradition; he delivers a serious, nuanced and balanced look at its role. Though they're presented here in a Jewish context, the religious issues he deals with here are profoundly important for Christians (or persons of any faith) as well.Like all great novels, this one has other dimensions as well. (The meaning of the title is also multi-faceted: Danny is \"the chosen,\" but Reuven is also \"chosen\" across sectarian lines to become his friend; and at a deeper level, Israel itself was chosen by God as the vehicle for His revelation to mankind.)For Gentile Christians like myself, another rewarding feature of this book is the window it provides into Jewish culture and thought, especially the American urban Jewish culture that had so great an influence on the shaping of our country in the decades after the story takes place. Prior to reading this book, I really knew nothing at all about Hasidic Judaism, its origins or particular beliefs; so all of the historical information Potok seamlessly provides was fascinating to me."

        "user_review": "I came across this book in a \"must-read\" list and then luckily, saw it in a second-hand bookshop that I love visiting. Literature spun around the world wars has been my all-time favourite read; I find that the experiences born from human tragedies of this magnitude are honest and deeply affecting.The Chosen takes you through the journey of two teenage boys, Reuven and Danny, growing up in Brooklyn during the Second World War. They belong to different Jewish sects because of which their religious practices and even their family lives are poles apart -- the book focuses on and in a way compares their contrasting paternal relationships. As these factors contribute in shaping their religious identities and personalities, they try to strike a balance between traditional family values and modernity in the world around them. The quiet strength of their friendship helps them to deal with the pressures of life and maintain their sanity in the face of the enormity and the hopelessness of war.It is not easy to empathize with people whose backgrounds and motives we don't comprehend. And even if we are aware of their reasons, we are usually not ready to see things from a different vantage point. This rings especially true when those people are conservative or follow orthodox religious practices. We dismiss their \"peculiar behaviour\" by attributing it to a limited world-view and an unprogressive attitude. Nevertheless, unlike some of us (including me), Reuven Malter, with his open heart, understands and accepts Danny's world and becomes a part of it. And just like Reuven, this book quietly takes a place in your heart with its simplicity and gentleness.\"The Chosen\" reminded me how important is the freedom of choice which we have (or not) and may take for granted, be it the freedom (not) to follow tradition, practice religion or pursue a career. Individual fulfillment should be the most important consideration in making such decisions. Sadly, some of us do not have the luxury of choosing.Amongst the many lessons that I will take away from this book, the most important one for me is that a good heart is far more valuable than a brilliant mind, and we should take utmost care to sow in it the seeds of love and compassion. I could do with a little less of Talmud discussions between the Saunders and Reuben, but they don't hamper the pace of reading as they are woven into the story. Overall, I really liked the book and will not mind reading it once again."

        "user_review": "Chaim Potok says in his foreword to the book that he wanted to write \"an encompassing metaphor. How to make a unity of such disparate entitles—the war in Europe, a childhood eye injury, the mesmerizing quality and dark menace of certain books, Freud, religion, psychology, mathematical logic, sacred texts, scientific text criticism, Zionism, the Holocaust.\"In that he did a great job. The book was beautiful and memorable. It teaches history and a few life lessons, but overall, I found it tedious, boring. I continued reading it because the story will last in my mind, and I knew that I could never consider that it was not a great novel.A rabbi teaches his son, Danny, the Talmud but otherwise never speaks to him. It is the Hasidic way to teach. The silence causes suffering, but it is through this suffering that he is to learn compassionate and how to find his own answers in life. This is true. In my own life the silence from the Jehovah's Witnesses, the shunning, caused me suffering, but out of that I learned to have compassion for others who suffered and are suffering. Finding my own answers in life, well, maybe there are no real answers, but that is now okay.Then there is the boy Reuven, whose father is a teacher that studies the Talmud with him, but they are Orthodox Jews. Reuven's relationship with his father is one of admiration because his father is approachable, warm, and kind towards him; it contrasts with Danny's own relationship with his dad.The relationship between the fathers and sons, and between the boys, made this story work somewhat for me. Still, I didn't want to read a blow by blow account of a baseball game that lasted throughout entire first chapter, nor did I like hospital stories which took up a few more chapters.I thought after the baseball game, and then the hospital stay that the book would pick up, but then Danny was interested in psychology, mainly Freud. I had lost interest in psychology after 3 college courses, and I continued to lose interest in it when some of the Jewish men that I had dated back then wanted to analyze me. Maybe they became psychologists and don't have to use dates for their case studies, but I understand that they still can't stop analyzing their family members. So by now, as I am reading this book, I am irritated with it and an thinking of my women Jewish friends who I knew back then, who, when they would hear something that they didn't like, said, \"Oy vey.\" I silently screamed, \"Oy vey\" over and over again.So while Danny wanted to become a psychologist, his father wanted him to become a rabbi. He was depressed over this but Freud's thoughts on the human condition depressed him even more. Psychology can do that, but religion can as well. I considered him stuck between a rock and a hard place.And so yes, there was religion, the long lessons that each boy had to learn when their fathers taught them the Talmud. They learned it inside and out, and my own mind was screaming inside and out, yet I also knew that this way of learning could be applied to other curriculums. It is just that have grown sick of religion over the years, over my own struggles to find answers in life. I am sick of the shunning that goes on in them, of the righteousness, of believing that your religion is right and all others can go to hell or wherever their lack of faith takes them.I wanted to read a book about Jewish boys growing up in Brooklyn, N.Y., but I didn't want to read one that was academic. I thought more along the lines of their playing, not baseball, but in the creeks catching pollywogs. I also thought more along the line of their stealing apples out of a fruit stand that was outside of a store. But then I thought about my own Jewish friends who were in college, and none of us where interested in anything other than college, and well, men. We were past the age of pollywogs, but as I grew older I came back to the pollywogs.As I read this book I saw how the American Jews reacted to the end of WWII when they learned that 6 million Jews had been murdered with many being gassed and then burned in incinerators. My mind went back to two weeks ago when my husband and I were driving past a funeral home, and the smoke was coming out of the chimney of the crematorium; I cringed, thinking of those gas chambers in Auschwitz. I thought how uncivilized it was and how horrible to have it at the edge of our town. Maybe there is a reason that hell is beneath the earth.Then I went back to thinking of how Danny's father reacted to the fact that some of his family was murdered during the holocaust, and how he became depressed and emotionally disturbed, which lead me to thinking of how close Jewish ties were and still are, and I thought of how I didn't relate to any one race or religion, but that I mourned for the world, but also I feel that doing so has never affected me as much as it did them; it is too scattering, because there isn't that same sense of loss that you have with a family, with a close knit culture. Yet we must care for everyone and not limit ourselves.And as the years went by in my own life, as I learned more about humankind, I grew to believe that there is nothing that man cannot and will not do to another human being once he considers him his enemy. I learned how it doesn't make much to turn a friend, a family member, or even a group of people into the enemy. But both religion and politics divides us like this, and other expectations do as well, and there is probably no way to get around it. Still, I have to hold on to the belief that some men will never change; they will always remain humane.Now, American politics reminds me of how Hitler came to power, and while I still read non-fiction books, when things get too heavy in regards to the news, I like to pick up a book about childhood memories; it is my own therapy. This book was not therapy.I think of how Americans, according to an article in the Aarp Magazine, are having health problems due to the news, and those who need therapy don't talk about their own problems in therapy, they just talk about Trump. But America, outside of the men and women in the military, has not faced war in their homeland since the Civil War, and I know that some Americans fear that this can happen here, or that our world will just be blown up. They don't know what real fear feels like, yes, they know of the sleepless nights, of the worry, but they don't understand the suffering. No one does that has not experienced it."

        "user_review": "At its core The Chosen is about the relationship between two Brooklyn boys Danny and Reuven, the world they grow up in, and their relationship with their fathers. Both are Jewish, but while they share the same faith, they belong to radically different portions of that faith. Danny isHasidic. What's more he is the son of aRebbeand expected to take up the mantle with the passing of his father. Reuven, on the other hand, is part of modern Orthodox Judaism and is the son of a Talmudic teacher.While growing up mere blocks from each other they do not cross paths until a baseball game brings them together... and then sends Reuven to the hospital when Danny slams a line drive into Reuven's face, breaking his glasses and sending glass into his eye. So, not the best foot for a relationship to get off on. Danny visits Reuven in the hospital and while Reuven is initially hostile to Danny his father convinces him to give Danny and chance and they begin to become friends.The relationship between the two boys blossoms as they grow up. We discover Danny is brilliant, with a once in a generation mind who fears being trapped into the role of his people's Rebbe. His father only speaks to him when they discuss the Talmud and forbids him from reading world book such as Freud and Darwin. Reuven, while still very smart, is much more mathematically inclined than Danny. In spite of their differences they become great friends, spending many evenings and Sabbaths together. In the background WWII is coming to a close and the horrors of the Holocaust are being reveled.This leads to the big clash in the book, Zionism. Immediately post-WWII, when the full horrors that had been visited on the Jews was made widely known there was a resurgence inZionism, specifically a homeland in British Palestine. While many Jews were in favor of a return to their historic homeland, the more religious ones (such asEdah HaChareidis) thought that their could never be a Jewish state until the return of Messiah. Danny's father passionately felt this way while Reuven's father was an ardent Zionist. This matter was further complicated byJewish terrorist attacksas well as attackes by Arabs and the British on Jewish neighborhoods and immigrants. It was a huge mess and naturally the boys are caught in the middle with Danny's father forbidding Danny from seeing or interacting with Reuven.Potok's writing in conveying all the emotions Reuven experiences throughout the book is stupendous. We see him grow both as a person coming into his own as a man and his relationship with Danny. We see his evolving attitude towards his own religion and how he chooses it to affect his life. Naturally Potok, an orthodox rabbi himself, treats all these conflicts with a deft and empathetic hand. There are no good guys or bad guys, just people trying to navigate the turbulent times they live in. Even the rather monstrous silent treatment Danny's father subjects him to comes from a place of love and compassion. The tragedy of the book is what circumstances people find themselves in through no fault of their own and how it affects their relationships with others. But such is the nature of life, so beautifully encapsulated by this novel."

        "user_review": "I'm really struggling with how to review this book. It was beautifully written. The relationships between Danny and Reuven and between Reuven and his father were real and touching. I enjoyed learning about different systems of Jewish faith and the interactions (or lack thereof) between their communities. The historic insights into WWII and its aftermath, particularly the realization among American Jews of the extent of the Holocaust and the formation of the state of Israel, were fascinating.But I was so distracted and disturbed by Reb Saunders's coldness toward his own son, his lack of willingness and/or ability to even talk to him outside of Talmudic discussion that it's difficult for me to get past it. His explanation toward the end of the book didn't really help. It was obvious that he loved his son and was incredibly proud of him, and that he truly believed that he made the best choice he could at the time in how to raise his son with a soul, though he admitted when asking for forgiveness from Danny, \"A wiser father...may have done differently. I am not...wise.\" My heart just ached for the pain and suffering he had put both himself and his son through. And I was especially disheartened that Danny said he may raise his own son in silence, too, \"if I can't find another way.\" I don't understand the reasoning behind being cruel to your child (because this was definitely emotional abandonment and neglect, if not outright abuse) in order to teach him compassion. There are better ways to teach compassion, even to intellectual geniuses like Danny.For more book reviews, visit my blog,Build Enough Bookshelves."

        "user_review": "Well, I just finished this book last night and I must say I was deeply moved by the whole experience. I remembered there was a reason I liked it so much back in high school. I love the relationship between the two main characters, Danny and Reuven. They've reminded me that there are definite friendships that I cherish highly, and that true friends are hard to come by. But when they do, you know in your heart that you will never leave them for the rest of your life. I guess after reading this, it's made me sit back and just realize that I do cherish and love my friends and that without them, I wouldn't be able to get through this life.I really like the parts of the book where it focuses on the relationship between the two boys and their respective fathers. You can tell each father loves his son immensely, but in different ways. I also like re-learning all the things about the Jewish community, at least as much as Chaim Potok talks about. Not being Jewish, I've found a lot of the history that I didn't know about and the Jewish customs so very intriguing. I've definitely been enlightened by this book, which I consider a good thing. Mr. Potok's writing is very direct as well as descriptive, and he has such a great way of writing. And there were one or two chapters that I was so moved by his writing, that I did indeed become a little teary-eyed.I highly recommend this book, especially if you want to reaffirm what true friendship means to you."

After that book I kept my eyes open for his books in every used book sale I used to haunt, and I collected quite a few over the years.But I haven't read them in ages, and late last year I began to feel like revisiting Potok. So I dug out all the titles I had, ordered a few others, set them up in reading order, and here we are.The Chosen was Potok's first novel. It tells the story of thr relationship between Reuven and David, both fifteen years old when we meet them and they first meet each other, during a baseball game between teams from two different neighborhood yeshivas. There is a frightening incident that binds the boys into a friendship neither expected but that each one needs more than they themselves realize.This is a dramatic, intense book. Through his remarkable characters Potok shares Jewish history, explores the relationships (or lack thereof) between people who are of one religion but different approaches to God within that religion, between fathers and sons, between a group of people and the world itself.I am thrilled to be reading Potok again! So thrilled that I started reading the sequel to The Chosen right away and got so lost in its pages that I forgot all about needing to write this review until the moment I reached the final page ofthatbook. So I have a little more 'work' to do today!"

They liked it, fascinated by the details of Jewish life and customs, and were eager to talk about the dynamics between fathers and sons. We had a great conversation about why the first fifth of the book is taken with a description of a baseball game. This is one of the few books I know, and certainly the most popular, that makes Talmud study sexy. One prisoner hoped that the Hasidic Danny and the Modern Orthodox Reuven would battle it out over Talmud. Did this book do for Talmud study what the Leon Uris's Exodus did for Zionism? Re-reading the Chosen, I was struck by the emphasis placed on Zionism as Reuven's father works feverishly—literally, every character is sick or sickly in this book—for a Jewish State back when that was something you could root for with little qualification. One reader stumped me at the end of our session: Why does the Talmud say that silence is more valuable than words?"

        "user_review": "There are a lot of Jewish people in Brooklyn. One of them is my wife, but most of them aren't. There are a bunch of Modern Orthodox Jews, and the US's largest population of Hasidic Jews, basedfamously in Williamsburg.They're both conservative; one major difference is that Hasidic Jews are anti-Israel, for complicated and dumb reasons. The Chosen is about a friendship between a Modern Orthodox Jew, Reuven Malter, and a Hasidic Jew named Danny Saunders. I only heard about Chaim Potok and this book recently, which surprised my wife; for her, The Chosen was a core high school text.There's a lot of attention to analysis of the Talmud, a dizzying body of arcane arguments about religious details. Some bookish men from both traditions dedicate their lives to learning about this stuff, which seems like a shame; here are these perfectly good readers who are not reading Middlemarch. If you want to know more about all that, you'll love this book. I found it interesting, mostly.The boys are footsoldiers in a larger debate / battle between opposing schools of Jewish belief,, deployed in a way by their fathers, who never meet face to face but are extremely aware of each other. They respect each other, but disagree vehemently. Danny's father, in a story so crazy it must be true, hasn't spoken to him since he was an infant; they discuss Talmud together but otherwise don't communicate at all. He's trying to teach him compassion. I suggested to my wife that we try this with our kid, and she was like \"Good luck keeping your mouth shut for more than thirty seconds,\" which is a decent point.It's a glimpse into a foreign and exotic world, even though it's like two neighborhoods away from me, and it's all interesting but it feels a little \"young adult\" to me. The story is written in simple language, and the message is overstated to make sure you don't miss anything. I don't think it's particularly great literature."

It's a story of friendship, of family love, of the relationships between fathers and sons, set against the background of Hasidic Judaism. This time, I'm unconvinced that raising a child in silence, as Danny's father does, will result in a compassionate child, but I am moved by Danny's struggle to be both himself and what his father and his father's followers need him to be. Reuven, the narrator, serves both as a channel for what the reader (who can't be presumed to know anything about Orthodox Jews) needs to learn and as a support for the brilliant Danny, without being diminished by his best friend's brilliance. In fact, Reuven's complementary abilities keep Danny from being unbelievable in his intellectual flawlessness; Danny acknowledges that he and Reuven think differently, and one of my favorite scenes is a class in which Reuven takes four days to explicate a difficult passage of the Talmud while Danny silently cheers him on. It's a brilliant book, emotionally challenging, and one I will no doubt come back to again."

One boy is a genius whose father will go to extreme lengths to preserve his faith in God.

A fascinating story, a page-turning friendship, and a rite of passage with the boys becoming men on two very different paths by the end."

I slogged through many of religious details and history and the lectures and debates.I loved Reuven's relationship with his father.

Even then, it was hit-or-miss at first; reviews started out as thumbnails and didn't come until later. Couldn't find this one but husband's list provides me with a backup. Early 2009, so maybe actually listened in 2008. Since we both listened, maybe a car trip. ...Double-checked and found I had listed after all. 2009!"

        "user_review": "I love how Chaim Potok is able to create a story about so many different things. There are dozens of topics within his books to discuss, enjoy and ponder, but he manages to twist and turn his story, so at its end, you get the Rubik's cube sides all neatly back to the same color.Like My Name Is Asher Lev, which I loved, Potok writes about a Jewish boy torn between his own genius and his orthodox father's expectations. Danny Saunders, a genius boy with a photographic memory, is destined to take his father's place as the community tzaddik, or spiritual leader of Hasidic Jews. To teach his son compassion, he parents him with silence, like his father did before him, and the only time father and son talk is when they discuss the Talmud, a Jewish book consisting of different rabbi's discussions of Jewish laws and ethics.But, the father-son relationship is only one side of the thematically complicated but narratively simple story. There is much food for thought about friendship (\"You think it is easy to be a friend? If you are truly his friend, you will learn otherwise\") which Danny's father, Reb Saunders, tells the narrator of the story, Reuven Malter, and certainly proves to be true. There is a fantastic development about the Zionist movement, and the opposition within the Jewish community against Israel to be created after the second World War. There is an interesting, albeit outdated, flirtation with psychology and Freudism. And much, much more...especially if someone could simply live inside my head and answer back whenever I had a \"and what do you think about this?\" moment.I find that one of Potok's greatest achievements is his ability to narrowly write a story that happens in a close, sheltered environment about a specific religious belief, and have it easily apply to many different beliefs and situations. I found myself thinking to myself most of today about how this story, about a community of ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jews, has a lot in common with my current community. This place, where I live, has the broadest spectrum of believers/non-believers, practicing/non-practicing, ultra conservative/ultra liberal members of my own religion. The characters in the story are living and functioning in an almost self-contained environment. Their schools are Jewish. Their sports teams are Jewish. Their stores, hospitals, friends and neighborhoods are Jewish. The conflict is not \"us vs. them\" but \"old us vs. new or changing us\" and \"holier us vs. secular us\". They don't see the world around them.Ding, ding, ding!!!Like poor Reb Saunders had to discover by isolating his son from his best friend, and what David Saunders knew, but didn't have the courage to proclaim, good exists in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. It exists down the street, where perhaps the homes aren't matching brown stucco craftsman style. It exists at the other school. It exists in literature and areas of study and even at the church with the different shaped spire. There is goodness everywhere.This belief of mine is fundamentally different from Reb Saunders, who explained that each person is born with a tiny spark of goodness which is enveloped in a shell of ugly and evil. It is the responsibility of the parent, the church, the community to protect that spark, encourage it, feed it so that it can grow and expand to eventually fill the shell and push out the evil.While there is certainly plenty of evil surrounding us all, I think it only gets more bold and has more room to grow when we huddle around our goodness. It, goodness, is bigger than we allow it to be. We need to link goodness to goodness and charge down the street, all ablaze together.Kind of a tangent, but I love books that make me go off down one. I can't say this book is a favorite, because it didn't make me feel the way a book needs to, but I'm certainly glad I've read it and happily encourage anyone who hasn't to do so."

I found the book initially to be a relaxing solace on my commute home after a busy day of work, soley because of its use of language and setting. But I hated the characters. All of them. Quoyle, a big, damp loaf of a man, as Proulx describes him, is the definition of pathetic. His daughters are brats. And his wife Petal is a two-dimensional device created solely as a catalyst for the story to come. In the beginning it felt a little forced. Then at some point in the second half, the book went from a nice little read to a ferocious page-turner, and I still am not sure how it became so compelling. There was no melodramatic conflict introduced. No secret codes to be found in paintings. Instead, Proulx builds her momentum slowly, slowly, taking you deeper into the lives of these characters, who started out so hard, unattractive, broken, and nasty. The thing of it is, they start to feel so honest. Before you know it, their presence is comforting. I found I wanted to be with them. Wanted to be in the boat with Quoyle. Wanted to see the green house. Wanted to go to the Christmas Pageant. Wanted to eat flipper pie with him and the girls. Wanted to welcome Aunt home.Quoyle finds redemption from a place that itself is bleak, full of hardship, and dying. I found this to be poetic and strangely uplifting. Its sort of the anti-coming of age story. No beautiful starry-eyed twentysomething trotting off to exotic locations or big cities here. Instead, the story of a middle-aged man who hates himself even more than he hates his circumstance, moving back to his modest roots, finding a lot of darkness in the places he comes from. He watches people fall on hard times and move away, endures monotony, deep cold, harsh storms and odd, forced relationships. And in the midst of it he finds friendship, love, and his own self-worth. I just thought it was beautiful. The scene near the end in which Quoyle prepares to attend the wake for one of his close friends, looks at his gigantic naked body in the mirror, and feels a surge of joy to be such an honest and satisfying moment of redemption. This dying place brings him to life, and eventually, for the first time in his life, he finds joy and peace. And he finds it in himself, not in the circumstances around him.It snuck up on me. I didn't realize until it was too late how hard I had fallen for this lot."

They are overweight or pock-marked or not quite attractive, in that left-behind kind of way They are all damaged in some way, usually by the loss of loved ones to nature.But the characters are small specks against the giant backdrop of rock, sea and storms. I'll call this an \"environmental novel\" of Newfoundland. Man and woman against nature. We think of an island as the intersection of land and water - two systems - but it's really the intersection of three great earth systems - land, water and atmosphere.Here we see Mother Nature in all her glory inflicting herself on the puny inhabitants of this rock coast. Wind, rain, waves, snow, storms, ice, seafoam, icebergs are really the main characters.Shipping News is the antithesis of the beach book.

        "user_review": "\"The Shipping News\" is E. Annie Proulx's second novel, published back in 1993. The book won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. She has a unique voice and her command of language is impressive. The strength of this book is her prose and strong sense of place. She writes in short staccato sentences, sometimes even using incomplete phrases, but with such inventive and fitting language. She seems to have a vast vocabulary but uses rare words sparingly. Her unpretentious talent is more from finding creative uses of everyday words. This talent is fitting for a story that largely takes place in a sparse, inhospitable place, with simple characters and results in real depth underneath these humble characters and locals.The story follows Quoyle, a hulk of a man, who's life begins with dysfunction and tragedy. He is a man adrift in upstate New York, deadened from abuse and ill treatment. The only positive thing he receives from his early life and broken marriage to an unfaithful and dreadful wife, is two daughters. An Aunt, Angis Hamm, convinces Quoyle to return to his ancestral home in Newfoundland where he finds work on the local newspaper. This is where the story really finds solid ground with Proulx deftly describing the local culture, language, and harsh climate of Newfoundland.If there is a weakness in this book, it's that the striking language, and intriguing side observations tended to distract me from the story line. There were moments where I became lost in the story and needing to backtrack or accept that I was lost for a bit, until I found enough clues to navigate back to familiar waters. While several key characters were fully formed, many of the secondary characters were one dimensional and never took shape in my mind. However, the strength of the prose and the rich setting were enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire story. There was just enough struggle and heartbreak to drive the story and we see real change in Quoyle.I finished \"The Shipping News\" feeling that Proulx is a better writer than character builder and story teller. But I still believe she's a talent and this is an important work. There is such great connection between her language skills and the setting and people of this book. The desolate location, angry ocean, and gritty town feel like the best, most recognizable character in the book, if that makes sense. Worthy of its acclaim and awards, I give it four and a half stars, rounded to five. An artistic tale of small triumphs and personal growth perched in the richly layered backdrop of a seaside northern town."

        "user_review": "During the years that I was the manager of a business, I had the wonderful good fortune to have on staff many people originally from Newfoundland. One aspect that I found fascinating is the similarities between that relatively small 'rock' and my holiday in southwest England many years ago. In England, I noticed that accents and the way certain things were said changed about every five miles. The same is true with Newfoundland. Definitions and phrases are different depending on where people lived. The most interesting part is that even though they would use different terms for the same things, they could still understand each other! Well, it's all English after all.This story follows a family from New York to Newfoundland where Quoyle's family is from originally. His Aunt travels with the family and is looking forward to a new start with Quoyle and his two daughters in the place she had left behind nearly 50 years before.The writing is very different and interesting. While they are in their small town in New York, the sentences are terse, choppy – very few articles and no conjunctions. Tight, compressed sentences that reflected their tight, compressed existence.When they arrive at their destination, everything changes – the sentences gradually grow and expand. There are poetic turns of phrase mingled with the mangled English of the Newfoundlanders. Quoyle, a would-be journalist starts to turn out interesting articles for the newspaper whose owner still goes out fishing whenever he can.I was enthralled with the people I met while reading and when this family saga ended - of loves lost and found; of careers begun, stalled, and begun again; of friendships and warmth and caring; of dark times and sad times and cruel times and joyful times – when it all came to an end, I felt I would give anything for a few more (like 10 or 20) chapters, even though the ending is perfect.This novel won several prizes, including both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. It is always a pleasure to me when a book I enjoy so much is given accolades and recognition, and this one is a perfect example."

        "user_review": "This was one of the first twenty books I added to my to-read shelf here on Goodreads nearly eight years ago. Along the way, I somehow acquired not just one but two copies of this Pulitzer prize winning novel. Either my memory of what I own failed me, or I really wanted to read this. In any case, it was high time I grabbed one of those copies from my bookshelf! Besides, it's so well loved, I was sure to be wild about it as well. I'm sorry to say that something went wrong here, friends. While I did respect Proulx's work, I'm not able to write a gushing review of it! I'm kind of stumped to explain exactly what happened.\"Here is an account of a few years in the life of Quoyle, born in Brooklyn and raised in a shuffle of dreary upstate towns.\"I'm all for the everyman or everywoman story. These are the kind of characters who appear to live rather ordinary lives; nothing flashy about these people. Kent Haruf and Elizabeth Strout write some of the best, in my opinion. John Williams'sStonercomes to mind immediately as well. There's a quality to their writing that makes me feel as if there is indeed something remarkable about these quiet folks after all. Their humanity shines through. I just didn't feel it here, and I'm having difficulty pointing out why. Perhaps it's all due to the writing style? Much of this novel is written in fragmented, choppy sentences - the sort your former high school English teacher would have gleefully marked up with the dreaded red pen in hand. Not that I mind this unconventional approach as a rule. I felt it lacked a kind of warmth here that would have been the perfect counterbalance to the stormy, frigid atmosphere of the Newfoundland setting.\"At last the end of the world, a wild place that seemed poised on the lip of the abyss. No human sign, nothing, no ship, no plane, no animal, no bird, no bobbing trap marker nor buoy. As though he stood alone on the planet. The immensity of sky roared at him and instinctively he raised his hands to keep it off. Translucent thirty-foot combers the color of bottles crashed onto stone, coursed bubbles into a churning lake of milk shot with cream.\"The setting is what truly stole the show for me entirely – that and the description of the old homestead, going back generations through the Quoyles, a family with a rather colorful, infamous history. Newfoundland is on my long list of places to visit someday. Proulx's powerful descriptions went a long way in putting some stunning images in my mind's eye. I wish that more of the plot had transpired at the old house. It was to this home that the protagonist, Quoyle, had fled with his two little girls and an aunt after misadventure and catastrophe struck. There was a delicious sense of foreboding whenever the house was described – I love it when a place becomes nearly like a living and breathing entity. My wish was not to be fully granted, however. A bit of a disappointment, I admit. I would have happily spent many more days beneath that nightmarish roof. I wanted more of this:\"The house was heavy around him, the pressure of the past filling the rooms like odorless gas. The sea breathed in the distance… But the house was wrong… Dragged by human labor across miles of ice, the outcasts straining against the ropes and shouting curses at the godly mob. Winched onto the rock. Groaning. A bound prisoner straining to get free. The humming of the taut cables. That vibration passed into the house, made it seem alive… he was inside a tethered animal, dumb but feeling. Swallowed by the shouting past.\"There's a motley crew of characters besides the Quoyle family. They were well described, but I can't say I ever latched onto a single one of them. There are some unhappy and tragic pasts that are revealed. I swear I'm not completely heartless, but these failed to move me! I was fully inspired by at least three more novels before this one. Let's just say that Anais Barbeau-Lavalette, Jeanette Winterson and Annie Ernaux are at least partly to blame for my lackluster response toThe Shipping News. My apologies to Annie Proulx who through no fault of her own failed to seduce me as these three women writers did. I know I'm in the unpopular minority with my three star rating, but I've always said I believe in second chances. I have a collection of her short stories waiting for another day.\"All the complex wires of life were stripped out and he could see the structure of life. Nothing but rock and sea, the tiny figures of humans and animals against them for a brief time.\""

        "user_review": "Like with almost every other Pulitzer darling, we accompany the protagonist for the entire ride, & this one is exceptionally literary in that brave, EveryMan-type way. This: the prototype for the ever ambitious, ever elusive Great (semi)American Novel in which the elements of clever prose, revamped/revisited personal histories, of second chances and redemption, are outstandingly clear and pitched at full blast. Many novels read like this, and usually the one in that particular year earns itself magnanimous acclaim. Yes, it tries to do everything right. But why is this not a contemporary classic (ahem, \"Middlesex\")? Because, after all, as the drama becomes more elevated, the protagonist becomes somewhat... uninteresting. As the atmosphere becomes a desolated (desperate?) return to simplicity, the token characters pile on--the thesis being that with more people around the sadness which is omnipresent is diminished. The only way to succeed in life is to partake in it. Bottom line.No, this one is not without its problems--this is not Graham Greene, it is not Toni Morrison, it is not Geoffrey Eugenides, after all. Alas, it suffers from similar ailments shared by other Pulitzer winners: it is, at times, a tad too superficial (\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\"); somewhat dull-ish, small, insignificantish (\"Breathing Lessons\"); dense (\"American Pastoral\") or even a little too long, overdone (sorry--\"Loneseome Dove\"). & it is thoroughly enjoyable, too. (Which is NEVER a detractor from the overall experience.)P.S. Several surprises await (in the last 12 pages) those readers who manage to reach the end. So... GET THERE, people."

Nothing that occured felt real or believed by the author herself (and it's not that I demand \"realism\"; One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of my favorites). It's that I felt like I could see the mechanisms behind all of her \"tricks\"...the anecdotes that characters told felt like ideas Proulx kept on a notepad before compiling them together for this novel. It read like the final project from a brilliant student finishing a course on creative writing.I'm not saying Proulx isn't a good *writer*...but I don't see her as a storyteller."

        "user_review": "The Shipping Newsis a wonderful read. We are introduced to Quoyle and follow him from his life and failed marriage in Mockingburg (!), New York through to his move and settling into Newfoundland with his two daughters, Bunny and Sunshine. There is a nearly Dostoyevski-level of tragedy underpinning the story - sexual assault, perversion, violence - which litters the road Quoyle travels down.There are a few innovative aspects to the text itself, the names and the grammar. Annie Proulx comes up with some of the most original names I have ever seen (Tert Card! Bunny! Partridge!) and this helps make the text more memorable and fun. The staccato sentence structure where she often drops the subject is a clever way of dropping us into a pseudo-interior dialog inside Quoyle's head. These two features give a unique dynamic to Proulx's writing.At the beginning of the story, Quoyle reminded me of Ignatius J. Reilly fromA Confederacy of Dunces, both physically and in terms of his lack of career, but fortunately for Quoyle, he quickly latches onto a friend, Partridge, and a career in journalism despite a rocky start.\"Quoyle didn't recognize news, had no aptitude for detail. He was afraid of all but twelve or fifteen verbs. Had a fatal flair for the false passive.\"(p. 8).Like Ignatius or even Augie March (The Adventures of Augie Marchto a degree, Quoyle is desperately trying to move beyond his limitations:\"In a profession that tutored its practitioners in the baseness of human nature, that revealed the corroded nature of civilization, Quoyle constructed a personal illusion of orderly progress. In atmospheres of disintegration and smoking jealousy he imagined rational compromise.(p. 10). Fortunately for him, he is able to surmount the early catastrophe with Petal and reconnect with his somewhat damaged, but still maleable kids and becomes a charming father figure. (Yes, I am skipping some detail here in an effort to avoid spoilers.)In his migration to the cold, windy north, he brings his aunt (herself full of incredible surprises) who imparts wisdom in little chunks:\"As you get older you find out the place where you started out pulls at you stronger and stronger...Probably some atavistic drive to finish up where you started.\"(p. 30). She is going back, with great courage, to a place where she personally suffered but where she will build herself up again despite her own setbacks.I wanted to mention that another characteristic of this book that makes it exceptional is the care the author takes to give a credible and poignant backstory to nearly all of the characters. None are mere cardboard cutouts of people. Even the crazy cousin has a moment of lucidity at the end. I found this to really bring me and bind me to the story.There is a lot of comedy in the novel - on arriving in Killick-Claw, Newfoundland, the scene in the Tickle (!) Motel, Bar & Restaurant was particularly hilarious off of Route 999 (about as far from anywhere as you can imagine!):\"Quoyle was the first to take a shower. Discoloured water spouted from a broken tile, seeped under the door and into the carpet. The sprinkler system dribbled as long as the cold faucet was open. His clothes slipped off the toilet and lay in the flood, for the door hooks were torn away. A Bible on a chain near the toilet, loose pages ready to fall. It was not until the next evening that he discovered that he had gone about all day with a page from Leviticus stuck to his back.\"(p. 55)Quoyle goes to work for the local paper, theGammy Birdand his male colleagues are all adorably bizarre. Nutbeem, Tert, and Billy plus his boss Jack - all described with care and humor. The book gets its title from Quoyle's column, The Shipping News, where he is to gather information on comings and goings from the port and which overtime he truly excels at while he gets used to the natural beauty (and unnatural human debris) of the area. Cleaning up around his house:\"When he came upon a torn plastic bag he filled it with debris. Tin cans, baby-food jars, a supermarket meat tray, torn paper cajoling the jobless reader...plastic line, the unfurled carboard tube from a roll of toilet paper. Pink tampon inserts.Behind him a profound sigh, the sigh of someone beyond hope or exasperation. Quoyle turned. A hundred feet away, a glistening back. The Minke whale rose, glided under the milky surface. He stared at the water. Again it appeared, sighed, slipped under. Roiling fog arms flew fifty feet above the sea.\"(p. 110). Her descriptions of nature are occasionally breathtaking like this one.In an important passage, Quoyle's colleague Billy gives him a metaphor for the schema for a man's life:\"Ar, that? Let's see. Used to say there were four women in every man's heart. The Maid in the Meadow, the Demon Lover, the Stouthearted Woman, the Tall and Quiet Woman.\"(p. 182). While I have a hard time relating that to my own experience, it definitely correlates directly to Quoyle. The Tall and Quiet Woman is clearly the wonderful Wavey (!) and the story of she and Quoyle is another wonderful highlight to this charming book.Each chapter begins with a quote, most often from a book of knots - the rope and knots being metaphors that are used throughout the novel. I really liked the last sentence of the story as well which uses this wonderful metaphor:\"Water may be older than light, diamonds crack in hot goat's blood, mountaintops give off cold fire, forests appear in mid-ocean, it may happen that a crab is caught with the shadow of a hand on its back, that the wind might be imprisoned in a bit of knotted string. And it may be that love sometimes occurs without pain or misery.\"(p. 355).Overall, this book was absolutely deserving of its Pulitzer Prize and made me want to read more work by this gifted author who, incidentally, was not published until she was in her 50s giving the present reviewer hope as yet! And I know I have to still see the movie with Kevin Spacey."

Perpetual motion and its status as \"currently reading\" on Goodreads together got me through it. I didn't care what happened to whom or how it would end, I just wanted it over. Amazing the things that passed for excitement and were given excessive air time in this novel: an incredibly detailed rendition of the kids' Christmas pageant; knitting; the uneventful daily commute and various mostly silent car rides. Enough to make you want to shout FIRE! and see if any of these characters does anything but look around slowly, gather up his belongings--carefully--and think about that phone call he wasn't now going to get to make about that boat motor. Sheesh! Then when something interesting was happening, or happened before but was just coming up in conversation, nothing much is made of it! It's all brushed under the rug as not being worthy of the words it would have taken to adequately describe. I don't give a rat's a$$ about the detailed description of the animal paintings on the children's cocoa mugs, but I would have liked to have heard how, exactly, Mrs. Yark managed to rescue them from the total destruction of her house and her entire town.And the names--nearly every one of them strange, and (to me) irksome. I couldn't decide through the entire book how to pronounce Quoyle--with a hard C or with a Kw. Wavey reminded me of Wavy Gravy. Petal. Marty for a girl. Beety. Last names (often used alone) were bizarre as well. Nutbeem. Pretty. Quoyle (double whammy, first and last). Buggit.One review called the book \"atmospheric.\" I'll give it that, if by Atmospheric they mean more \"cold pea soup, no crackers\" than \"Middle Earth with Orlando Bloom.\" Another (this one on the back of the book), \"a lyric page-turner.\" Whaaaa?Enough, glad its done; it drove me nuts. Good thing Proulx's Brokeback Mountain is a short story, because I still do want to read that."

        "user_review": "This is my first Proulx, so I didn't know if the unusual writing style is typical, or specially chosen for this particular story. I hope it's the latter, as it works very well.Update: I've now read the collection,Close Range: Brokeback Mountain and Other stories, which I reviewedHERE. Those stories use similar language, but somewhat toned down.It covers a couple of years (plus some backstory) in the life of thirty-something Quoyle: a big, lonely, awkward and unattractive man, always having or doing the wrong thing. He is a not very successful journalist in New York, who ends up moving, with his young daughters (Bunny and Sunshine) and aunt, to a small, somewhat inbred, community in Newfoundland where the aunt and his late father grew up. Somehow Proulx keeps the reader on the fence: he isn't especially lovable, and yet he elicits more sympathy than mockery in this reader.I think one weakness is that the mother of the girls is too horrible, and the manner of her departure from their lives stretched my credulity somewhat.LANGUAGEThe narrative style is the first thing to hit. It is very distinctive, continues throughout the book, and could be infuriating, though I didn't find it so. It is telegraphic and observational, reflecting Quoyle's job. There are staccato sentence fragments, and some overworked analogies, some of which are wonderfully vivid, and a few of which are laughably awful. Grammar sticklers may struggle to enjoy this book, but it's their loss - context is all, and in this context, I think it works.If I were as clever and witty as some of my GR friends (you know who you are), I would have written this review in the style of the book.Anyway, some typical examples:This is the entire opening paragraph of a chapter:\"The aunt in her woolen coat when Quoyle came into the motel room. Tin profile with a glass eye. A bundle on the floor under the window. Wrapped in a bed sheet, tied with net twine.\"Another whole paragraph:\"Near the window a man listened to a radio. His buttery hair swept behind ears. Eyes pinched close, a mustache. A packet of imported dates on his desk. He stood up to shake Quoyle's hand. Gangled. Plaid bow tie and ratty pullover. The British accent strained through his splayed nose.\"Analogies:* \"eyes the color of plastic\"* \"the sullen bay rubbed with thumbs of fog\"* \"On the horizon icebergs like white prisons. The immense blue fabric of the sea, rumpled and creased.\"* \"parenthesis around her mouth set like clamps. Impossible to know if she was listening to Nutbeem or flying over the Himalayas\"* \"In a way he could not explain she seized his attention; because she seemed sprung from wet stones, the stench of fish and tide.\"* \"eyes like a thorn bush, stabbing everything at once\"* The ghost of his wife, \"Petal's essence riding under his skin like an injected vaccine against the plague of love\"* \"Fingernails like the bowls of souvenir spoons.\" (That's the whole sentence.)THE TOWN AND COMMUNITYAspects of the town and its characters remind me of David Lynch's 1980s TV series \"Twin Peaks\": strange characters, often with impairments of mind, body or emotions, slightly strange names, odd superstitions, and dark secrets (murder, incest, rape, insurance fraud).The town of Killick Claw isn't prosperous, and the environment is still harsh, but it's better than when the aunt grew up there: \"The forces of fate weakened by unemployment insurance, a flaring hope in offshore oil money.\"The Gammy Birdis the local paper, and it's like no other: lots of adverts (many of them fake), deliberate typos and Malapropisms, libelous gossip (including a regular catalogue of sex abuse cases!), shipping news and \"we run a front-page photo of a car wreck every week, whether we have a wreck or not\". Poor Quoyle is bemused and has the uneasy and familiar feeling \"of standing on a playground watching others play games whose rules he didn't know\".THEMESKnots are the most obvious one. Each chapter opens with a quotation pertinent to what it contains, and many are fromAshley Book of Knots, which Proulx found second-hand, and gave her the inspiration and structure she sought. Knots feature in the plot metaphorically (in terms of being bound or adrift), in a more literal and superstitious sense. Rope can be wound and knotted to make good a wound or separation. We also learn that Quoyle's name means \"coil of rope\", and I suppose he is pretty tightly coiled for the first half of the book.Shipping is obvious, too, not just from the title, but because Quoyle ends up writing the eponymous shipping news in the local paper, in a community where everyone needs a boat. Most of the introductory quotes that are not from Ashley Book of Knots are from a Mariner's Dictionary. I confess there were times when the quantity and level of detail slightly exceeded my interest, but I'm glad I stuck with it.The book is riddled with pain, rejection, estrangement and mentions of abusive relationships (never graphic); many are haunted by ghosts of past events and relationships gone wrong. But although it is sometimes bleak, it is rarely depressing, and sometimes it's funny. Even close and fond relationships often have an element of awkwardness and distance; for instance, Quoyle always refers to \"the aunt\", rather than \"my aunt\". Even after living with her for a while, \"It came to him he knew nearly nothing of the aunt's life.

        "user_review": "QuoyleA coil of ropeA Flemish flake is a spiral coil of one layer only.It is made on deck, so that it may beWalked on, if necessary.THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTSMuch like that coil of rope, our protagonist, Quoyle, has also been stepped on all his life.A great damp loaf of a body. At six he weighed eighty pounds. At sixteen he was buried under a casement of flesh. Head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair ruched back. Features as bunched as kissed fingertips. Eyes the color of plastic. The monstrous chin, a freakish shelf, jutting from the lower face.He stumbles into the newspaper business through a friend he meets one night in a laundromat in Mockingburg, New York. He is not very good at it. He also meets Petal Bear, a small woman he yearns for, they share a month of happiness , followed by six years of misery, two children and a multitude of scars, seared into his flesh from her indiscreet, two timing ways. Petal Bear does not value Quoyle or his children. Alone, without work, without a wife, on the heels of his father's death, he decides to gather his children and follow his Aunt Agnis to his ancestral home on Newfoundland's stark and majestic coast.It is there, working for The Gammy Bird, a small newspaper, covering the shipping news, that Quoyle battles his inner demons and struggles to build a new life for himself and his daughters. But Quoyle is a man defeated, a man with no love of self. He even considers himself as a headline for one of his stories.Stupid Man Does Wrong Thing Once More.I wanted so badly for Quoyle to find some gumption, to love himself just a little. When an oil tanker docks a Killick-Claw, Quoyle writes an article about it. Before release, the entire tone of his article is rewritten by the managing editor, only this time Quoyle is incensed.\"This is a column\", bellowed Quoyle. \"You can't change somebody's column, for Christ's sake, because you don't like it! Jack asked me to write a column about boats and shipping. That means my opinion and description as I see it. This\" – he shook the paper against the slab cheeks –\"isn't what I wrote, isn't my opinion, isn't what I see.\"At last! I was so overcome with sheer joy that I leapt out of my deckchair, threw my arms in the air and let loose a resounding \"YES\"! (okay so my neighbours may think I am a little hinky)This is a great story, with a cast of truly colourful characters but if you will bear with me for just a moment, I would like to talk about what this book, wrong or right, said to me.You cannot leave your past behind, no matter where you travel, there too, it is.Everyone is worthy, not all heroes are tall, dark, handsome, beautiful, sexy, confident or comfortable in their own skin.You cannot run, but you can dig deep and you can find a new hope, a new joy in life.Family is defined not only by blood but also by bond, by those who are there, in the dark and the light.These homes of love we build, house many rooms, sanded and painted in the shades and colours of our life, furnished with those moments that, however inconsequential they may seem to others, have in fact, defined us.Cover beauty is coveted and exploited; provides keys to all the right doors, but it is our inner selves, our own moral code that is the true compass to the coveted life of beauty, peace, happiness and love.I am not going to lie. I love the fact that this story unfolds on the stark and beautiful, majestic coast of Newfoundland, a province in the land I call my own.Very rarely do I change a rating on a book once I have set it, but in this case, how can I not. Trust me, this story is worthy of every one of those five stars.Finally I would like to thank Steve who wrote an incredible, heartfelt review of this work that put it on my radar."

        "user_review": "Thankfully negative reviews are somewhat of a rare commodity for me. In the case of The Shipping News, it's difficult to find any positives, simply down to Proulx's writing style which I never could grasp hold of, along with dialogue that annoyed the hell out of me. The star of the show if there was to be one, is Newfoundland itself, the characters I struggled to feel anything for, even in the more moving moments, I am still left though with a mixed reaction. I wondered what Proulx had against relative pronouns and conjunctions. I stumbled over sentences after sentence trying to accommodate myself with it, worst luck, it stayed like this for the entirety.Down on his luck Journalist Quoyle, with young daughters Bunny and Sunshine in tow, heads to Newfoundland to hopefully reignite his floundering life, leaving New York, and a dead wife behind he travels to stay with his Aunt Agnis in a run down ancestral home right by the sea, it's remote, it's bleak, it's cold. He would take a job writing of the shipping news across the water for a paper called...wait for it...the gammy bird. The other characters in the book also have odd names, there's Wavey Prowse, Tert Card, Beaufield Nutbeem, Diddy Shovel and Alvin Yark, 10/10 for imagination. Becoming acquainted with the locals, Quoyle sutters along in life whilst trying to adapt to his surroundings, all the while weary of his daughters, and the affect it had on their own upbringing.Proulx does do a wonderful job when describing Newfoundland, this was just about as good as it got for me, and after a promising opening setting the scene, I actually was looking forward in a positive light. However, the prose style is a big sticking point, and the pacing didn't suit me either, which, quite frankly was all over the place. To it's credit, it certainly wasn't dull, the characterisation was pretty good, But apart from Quoyle, aunt, and daughters, I didn't like spending time with any others, had I lived in a trailer, wore a Budweiser cap, and went boating I may have done.Someone mentioned to me they would rather read of Newfoundland than go there. I disagree, would gladly get out my winter warmers and stand on the rocks staring into the fog, than read this again. As for a Pulitzer prize, the competition was either weak or non-existent.Not all bad, just not my cup of tea. 2/5."

        "user_review": "Ah the Shipping News. I remember my heart dropping when I read this book the first time. I thought, \"If this is what people are writing, I am no writer.\"This book is revolutionary in it's use of language. She punctuates inventively and her punctuation \"style\" gives her sentences a strange movement. The book moves, it actually moves, as you read it.There are moments of such pain like when Quoyle lies still in his bed as Petal Bear fucks another man in their home--and it's not written in a way where you feel pity or anger; but you identify, I mean you get still like Quoyle--or I did...There is this triplet of sentences where Quoyle realizes Bunny may fall from the ladder she is beginning to climb and when I read it, I felt my stomach drop and had a quick intake of breath--but those sentences were non dramatic, not written to scare or startle--it wasn't even the sentences that got me like that, it was like this weird pause orchestrated by creative punctuation.Oh I really can't explain it...I just think this book is one of the best books I have ever read and by the way, the movie sucked something rancid and you should never see it. But read read read this book."

        "user_review": "\"The old life was too small to fit anymore.\"I picked up \"The Shipping News\" recently while I was staying in a house in Nova Scotia that could have easily been the setting for the novel. Perhaps that aided in my enjoyment of the text? One thing it certainly did was reinforce for me how well the author (E. Annie Proulx) captured the setting and atmosphere of Newfoundland. The sense of place in this novel is well done. You feel the environment and Newfoundland in particular.A criticism of the text is that the style of the writing kept me from fully immersing myself in the story. Proulx's stylistic flourishes in this book are unique, interesting, and well done. And too much. However, having said that, I readily acknowledge her skill with language. At times, it is stunningly brilliant and original.I really appreciated, and understood, the protagonist's difficulty in putting a poisonous person/relationship behind him. It is artfully rendered, not cheap; as such issues can often be presented in lesser hands. Ms. Proulx captures that irony of fondly remembering a demon accurately.The final paragraph of \"The Shipping News\" is beautiful. Nothing else to say about it.A book that has been on my radar a while, now on my library shelf. It might not be for everyone, but it was for me."

        "user_review": "My introduction to the fiction of Annie Proulx isThe Shipping News. Published in 1993, the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was one of several literary awards bestowed on this evocatively stark tale of a Statie, his aunt and two young daughters who relocate from New York state to the (fictional) town of Killick-Claw in Newfoundland for a second start on life. Much like Margaret Atwood, Proulx was on trial in my mind throughout her novel, which like Atwood, never ceases to remind the reader that they're reading a novel. It dazzles with its language and impressively bends conventions, but was difficult for me to love, with story and characters often yoked to the service of its descriptions.The story involves a thirty-six year old oaf from the (fictional) town of Mockingburg, New York named Quoyle, who in the first of several reader-alienating devices, does not have a given name. An all-night clerk at a convenience store, he's befriended by a newspaperman named Partridge, who recommends Quoyle for the staff of a community newspaper as a reporter. A disappointment to his pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps father and walked over by his abusive wife Petal Bear, Quoyle's misfortunes continue when his terminally ill parents commit ritual suicide and Petal is killed in a car accident, having sold their daughters Bunny and Sunshine to sex traffickers on her way out the door.Quoyle's only family (and the most realized character in the novel) is his paternal aunt Agnis Hamm, a yacht upholsterer who suggests her nephew and children need a fresh start. Aunt Agnis is nostalgic for the place she grew up and offers to relocate with them to Quoyle's Point in Newfoundland, their ancestral home where a house has stood unoccupied in coastal wilderness for forty-four years. Braving the wind and sleet and tire tracks standing in for a road, the Quoyles find the house uninhabitable. They move to the nearest town of Killick-Claw, where Partridge has recommended Quoyle for a job on the community newspaper, theGammy Bird.He had never seen so many ads. They went down both sides of the pages like descending stairs and the news was squeezed into the vase-shaped space between. Crude ads with a few lines of type dead center. Don't Pay Anything Until January! No Down Payment! No Interest! As though these exhortations were freshly coined phrases for vinyl siding, rubber stamps, life insurance, folk music festivals, bank services, rope ladders, cargo nets, marine hardware, ship's laundry services, davits, rock band entertainment at the Snowball Lounge, clocks, firewood, tax return services, floor jacks, cut flowers, truck mufflers, tombstones, boilers, brass tacks, curling irons, jogging pants, snowmobiles, Party Night at Seal Flipper Lounge with Arthur the Accordion Ace, used snowmobiles, fried chicken, a smelting derby, T-shirts, oil rig maintenance, gas barbecue grills, wieners, flights to Goose Bay, Chinese restaurant specials, dry bulk transport services, a glass of wine with the pork chop special at the Norse Sunset Lounge, retraining program for fishermen, VCR repairs, heavy equipment operating training, tires, rifles, love seats, frozen corn, jelly powder, dancing at Uncle Demmy's Bar, kerosene lanterns, hull repairs, hatches, tea bags, beer, lumber planing, magnetic brooms, hearing aids.Quoyle's boss is Jack Buggit, a fisherman who launched a newspaper when the government proved inept at retraining him for anything else. Quoyle, whose journalism experience is limited to covering municipal news, is put on the car wreck beat, taking pictures and writing copy for the latest fatality, or using stock photos from past accidents if there hasn't been a new one. The fact that Quoyle's wife was just killed in a car accident seems not to have made an impression on Buggit, who also wants Quoyle to cover the shipping news, checking in each week with the harbormaster Diddy Shovel on which ships are coming and going.TheGammy Birdconsists the managing editor Tert Card, an alcoholic who detests the weather and economic malaise of Newfoundland and fakes almost all the ads in an effort to make the paper look profitable. Billy Pretty is Jack's second cousin, a bachelor who writes a salacious gossip column under the pseudonym Junior Sugg and offers to help Quoyle learn how to navigate the waters. Nutbeem is an English expat who covers the local sex abuse beat and reports foreign news he hears on the radio. Living in the Tickle Motel, where an inoperable phone and a broken doorknob traps them inside the room their first morning there, Quoyle gets a crash course in Newfoundland living.With land passage often more difficult than water, Quoyle pays $50 for a homemade speedboat, which becomes the laughingstock of Killick-Claw. Pooling resources with Aunt Agnis, he begins repairing the house on Quoyle Point, but learns that winter will ultimately close the twenty-eight mile road to town and make travel impossible. The shipping news grows from a list to a column, which permits Quoyle to express an opinion. Agnis tries to match her nephew with one of her seamstresses, but he gravitates toward a young widow named Wavey Prowse whose spouse, he learns, was also a philanderer. He tries to survive in a land determined to kill anyone who crosses it.These waters, thought Quoyle, haunted by lost ships, fishermen, explorers gurgled down into sea holes as black as a dog's throat. Bawling into salt broth. Vikings down the cracking winds, steering through fog by the polarized light of sun-stones. The Inuit in skin boats, breathing, breathing, rhythmic suck of frigid air, iced paddles dipping, spray freezing, sleek back rising, jostle, the boat torn, spiraling down. Millennial bergs from the glaciers, morbid, silent except for waves breaking on their flanks, the deceiving sound of shoreline where there was no shore. Foghorns, smothered gun reports along the coast. Ice welding land to sea. Frost smoke. Clouds mottled by reflections of water holes in the plains of ice. The glare of ice erasing dimension, distance, subjecting senses to mirage and illusion. A rare place.The pleasures ofThe Shipping Newscan be found in Annie Proulx's descriptions. She's peerless when it comes to describing atmosphere, weather or landscapes and transporting the reader to the environment, or the moment, of the scene she's describing. Newfoundland comes to life as an alien world populated by frontiersmen victimized by drowning seas, car accidents or a downturn in the fishing industry. In a misstep, Proulx also throws sexual abuse into the cauldron in a cavalier, almost jokey way, but the novel is at all times unique in its ability to carry the reader away to the far side of the world without judging it or making a mockery of the locals.Tert Card slammed through the door. \"I'm shinnicked with cold,\" he shouted, blowing on his chapped hands, backing his great rear up to the gas heater, \"this degree of cold so early in the season takes the heart out of you for the place. Trying to drive along the cliffs this morning with the snow off the ice and the wipers froze up and the car slipping sideways I thought 'It's only November. How can this be?' Started thinking about the traffic statistics. Last January there was hundreds of motor vehicle accidents in Newfoundland. Death, personal injury, property damage. In just one month. That's how the need begins, on a cold day like this coming along the cliff. First it's just a little question to yourself. Then you say something out loud. Then you clip out the coupons in the travel magazines. The brochures come. You put them on the dashboard so you can look at a palm tree while you go over the edge. In February only one thing keeps you going--the air flight ticket to Florida on your dresser. If you make it to March, boy, you'll make it to heaven. You get on that plan in Misky Bay, there's so much ice on the wings and the wind from hell you doubt the plane can make it, but it does, and when it glides and lands, when they throws open the door, my son, I want to tell you the smell of hot summer and suntan oil and exhaust fumes make you cry with pleasure. A sweet place they got down there with the oranges.\" He sucked in a breath, exhaled a snotty gust of sleek yellow water like a liqueur. Addressed Quoyle. \"Now, buddy, you got some kind of a car or boat wreck this week or not?\"IfThe Shipping Newswere narrative non-fiction or an article in theNew Yorker, it would be a five-star winner for me. Almost every paragraph is beautifully written, but they didn't add up to compelling fiction. Proulx's imagination falls short after the character of Aunt Agnis, who feels like she should be the protagonist. Quoyle and Waverly's relationship is given hardly any care or attention, while Bunny and Sunshine are also just there, adding nothing (the cute names of these characters adding to their artificiality). Descriptions of Newfoundland are the star attractions and I recommend the novel for those; story and characters small print on the back of the program."

It doesn't take a genius to spot my use of 'literary circles' as probably not being a compliment about this story of an awkward (physically and visually) cuckolded outlier having no other real option than picking up sticks and moving (with his daughters and an aunt) to his ancestral home in a remote part of Newfoundland in Canada, where he sort of, almost by accident finds himself. A book lauded for its prose, its portrayal of a quirky cast, and details of life in the past and present in this remote port community, all tinged with an underlying delicately dark humour. At least on this occasion, even though this was just too random, too uninteresting and too artificially constructed for me, I can see what others see in it. Just a 3 out of 12, One Star read for me though.Where this book went so wrong for me was having such an intriguing and eye opening start with the cuckolding of the main protagonist and his sad docile responses to the situations his wife put him into... and to go from that riveting scenario to tales of the awkward dude finding himself in the cold Canadian outback in a quirky community felt like a cold bucket of water over my reading head!2022 read"

        "user_review": "And it may be that love sometimes occurs without pain or misery.Ugh. I spent far too long readingThe Shipping Newsto waste much time reviewing it. This book tells the tale of Quoyle, a middle-aged man with a \"great damp loaf of a body\" who aspires to be merely pathetic. When his cheating wife is killed in a car accident, he moves with his two daughters and his aunt to their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Like Forest Gump, he somehow keeps failing upwards. Slowly, he sucks a little less, and by the end of the story he finds love.IsThe Shipping Newspopulated with quirky characters? I guess, but not any I cared about even a little bit. The aunt is a lesbian, which might have passed as edgy in the mid-1990s but today was so obvious that it was hardly worth mentioning (especially as it added nothing to the plot). Is there a plot? Barely, pretty much just what I listed above, and it moves painfully slowly, glacier-like. Is the writing great? Ms. Proulx uses lots of phrases and incomplete sentences. It creates an almost staccato effect that is certainly unusual and might be either brilliant or lazy, depending on your mood. The writing is the reason I added a second star to my rating; it certainly wasn't for the story.The Shipping Newssomehow won both the 1993 National Book Award and the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Is it too late to demand a recount?"

        "user_review": "This was a review in progress, as I waded through the bog of this book;1. (October 28) A deeply uninteresting, unlikeable boy grows up to be a deeply uninteresting, unlikable man. He marries a nasty piece of work (who is also deeply unlikable) and spits out two children that are exactly the children one goes out of one's way to avoid at shopping centres.Parents die, wife dies, aunt shows up out of nowhere and whisks the whole aimless uninteresting lot of them off to a dreary remote end-of-nowhere town in Newfoundland.That is the plot as it stands so far. This book won awards. Why is it that some committees feel that if it makes you miserable it must be good prose?Well, to be honest it is - good prose that is - the English is well constructed and the descriptive powers of the Author are formidable. Unfortunately this formidable prose is completely lacking in any mitigating humour that would save it from being heavy, dull and dreary to read.It might be that some shade of humour and likability may edge it's way between the covers after the man starts the job after which the book is named. I am just not sure it is worth the slog as so far the only enjoyable part of the book has been the knot work quotes at the start of each chapter.2. (November 7) There is room for all books in the world, it is good that we do not all read (or write, alike) this review is my opinion however and in my opinion overblown descriptiveness is a cheap and nasty way of convincing people that they are reading high quality literature when they are (usually) not. It is a specific style of writing that is only worthy of parodies such as Cold Comfort Farm, which mocked the florid style very well indeed.As an example of what I dislike about the over-florid style, The Shipping News is made to measure. Consider the following sentence; \"... oilcloth the colour of insect wings\" [pg 57]. Do you feel that information as to the colour of the oilcloth has been imparted to you?Really?Wings of which insect?Fruit flies and mosquitoes? (transparent with lovely iridescence and dark veins), Praying mantis? (usually, a delicate shade of green) Cockroaches? (dark brown for the outer wing case and light brown for the inner wings in ninety percent of species).Or maybe a butterfly which is also an insect, a fact that cannot have escaped an author as addicted as Annie is to using every English word in the dictionary whether or not it is relevant to the meaning she is trying to impart.3. (January 5th 2013) Finished. Thank goodness! there should be a way to give negative stars.4. December 2016It was certainly memorable. The painful, unpleasant memory has lingered over the years even though the memories of more enjoyable books have faded. So very memorable that I wince whenever I see the authors name printed and refuse to so much as pick up a book by her."

However wild the events, crashing and buffeting against the rocky coast it is the quietness that predominates and wins out.It is the kind of novel that wins prizes, because it is healing book, the past here is full of horror but in the present all those horrors are firmly confronted, resolved, stitched up, frayed ends knotted, no loose ends left and the future the author assures us can be happy irrespective of sexuality, personal needs or even the economy.The interesting idea I felt was the notion of place and person, every person has they place and out of their natural and proper environment they will fail like an oak in the Sahara, even their physicality will come across and ridiculous and uncouth, however once in their correct ecological niche, the human person can flourish. And this book is the story of one man finding his place. The square peg sliding comfortably into the square slot. There is a charm in that though you could read it as a condemnation and belittling of the regional novel - 'hey look, this is where loosers make sense!' a kind of elephant's graveyard for off beat literary characters."

        "user_review": "Annie Proulx exploded onto the literary scene with the publication of her second novel,The Shipping News. It was 1993 and she was 58. No victim of sophomore jinx,The Shipping Newsgave Annie a double boost: it won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer prize for Fiction - one of just six books picked by both juries, and has subsequently been adapted into a film.Born in Brooklyn and raised in a mix of small upstate towns, Quoyle is definitely not having the time of his life. Socially inept and not comfortable in his bricklike body, lonesome Quoyle shuffles from occupation to occupation in upstate New York. Marooned in the recession-struck town of Mockinburg, Quoyle tries his hand at journalism - and naively marries a good for nothing bimbo, who gives him two daughters but no love. Petal Bear - all characters in this novel have great names - is a vicious and hateful woman, who however never rises above the plot device necessary to move the story forward. And the story is grim enough - Quoyle finds that his life is falling apart: he has no sense of purpose or belonging. He turns to his aunt, Agnis Hamm, for advice - and it is she who convinces him to leave his miserable life in New York behind, take his daughters and go with her to the home of their ancestors, named after them - to Quoyle's Point, in Newfoundland. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Quoyle chooses The Rock - and so begins the story proper.Newfoundland is a large island on the eastern coast of Canada, known for its variable maritime weather which can surprise its population on any given day, forcing much of it to grow hard and fight their way through pounding waves and breaking storms. Newfoundland was England's first possession in North America - it became a colony in the early 17th century and remained first a colony and later a dominion of the United Kingdom until 1949, on which year it entered the Canadian Confederation and became the nation's tenth province. Two referendums had to be organized - the first was proven inconclusive, and the second was won by only a slight majority of pro-Confederation voters (52.3% to 47.7%). Since joining the Confederation Newfoundlanders continue to see themselves as a unique group, and have maintained their own culture, cuisine and even a variety of English language.For generations, cod fishery defined Newfoundland: it was a source of cultural and social identity, as most families were either directly involved in fishery or indirectly connected to it, by earning their livelihood as fish transporters or sellers, worked at fish plants and other fishing related businesses. For centuries Newfoundland fishermen used technology which allowed them to target specific species and ages of fish, map the area of fishing and limit the size of their catch. After Confederation Newfoundland fishermen were introduced to modern technology, such as the sonar and radar, which allowed them to fish deeper than ever and pursue fish on an unprecedented scale and compete with other nations that also fished in the region. However, these advances did irreversible damage to the stock of Northern cod: by fishing on larger areas and deeper scale the cod were depleted at the scale which did not allow the surviving fish to replete the stock fished each year; trawlers also caught an enormous amount of other fish, which although not commercially viable was invaluable to the area's ecosystem and severely disturbed the predator-prey relations among the fish. A significant amount of capelin were caught, on which the cod preyed - further fueling the speed of extinction of the remaining cod stock. In the summer of 1992, the Northern cod biomass - once the largest in the world - fell down to 1% of its previous level; in a dramatic attempt to save the cod the federal government declared a moratorium on cod fishery along the east coast, hoping that the cod population would recover and the fishing industry could be restored. It never did; the damage to Newfoundland's ecosystem was ineradicable, and the cod has not returned to Atlantic Canada. Cod fishery remains closed - it was the largest industrial closure in Canadian history - and over 35,000 fishers and people involved in fishing related businesses found themselves suddenly unemployed. The population of the province decresed by about 60,000, as many families were forced to leave the rock which borne them and hope for a life elsewhere.It is to this rock that Quoyle comes with his children and aunt, to the post-Confederation but also post-cod Newfoundland, where those who remain try to survive. There he meets Jack Buggit, Tert Card, Beaufield Nutbeem and Bayonet Melville, and others cast away in the small Newfoundland town of Killick-Claw, where Quoyle lands a job for the local paper,The Gammy Bird. Quoyle is to report car wrecks and the shipping news - arrivals and departures of ships into the harbor. Clumsily at first but nonetheless carrying on, Quoyle begins to find his own voice as a reporter, make friends and acquaintainces in the tightly-knit community and begins to find himself in the harshness of Newfoundland's weather, and begins to discover the past of his ancestors, themselves castaways from Newfoundland to New York.I have never been to Newfoundland, but I felt as if the book transported me there. Although Annie Proulx is an American, she moved to Newfoundland for research and spent time among Newfoundlanders, and wrote a book with a great sense of place (and its weather), populated with interesting and memorable people with great, quirky names. Although the story is a classic one - broken man leaves former life and begins anew - she sells it with her ability to transport the reader to the places she describes, and slowly draws him into her world. Newfoundland comes alive inThe Shipping News, with its fog and wind and blocks of ice clinking in the bay, the boats cradled by the waters at one time and violently thrown aside the next; smoke rising from the chimneys, people readingThe Gammy Birdand Quoyle's shipping news while sipping their warm drinks, each confronting their own problems, all united by the Rock they live on, loving and hating its rough caress at the same time.Chapters are introduced with a description of a knot fromThe Ashley's Book of Knots, serving as an illustration of the themes of the book - Quoyle is a coil of rope; \"A Flemish flake is a spiral coil of one layer only. It is made on deck, so that it may be walked on if necessary.\" Quoyle's first name is never given - he has been walked on all his life, and is like a coil of tangled rope. In Mockinburg he had few friends, and nobody took time to get to know him; Newfoundland is to literally be a place of his new self-discovery, but there everybody knows the Quoyles; Quoyle effectively becomes nothing more than an extension of his long dead family. Throughout the book, Quoyle has to untangle the knots made by others which tightened around him and made him a dangled mess and set free the person that he has inside of himself, andThe Shipping Newsis an admirable story of this one man's struggle to overcome personal defeat and his own shy pursuit of happiness on a harsh Canadian island, where hope swirls in the air even amidst the winter storm."

It's not just that the story is rich in and of itself - and it is - it's that the words themselves are so artfully assembed that they provide layers of undercurrents that add depth and emotion to the narrative. This book reads like a symphony, with many intertwined themes and narratives all woven together into a whole, unified picture.Proulx writes in choppy short sentecnes. It's akward and clumsy language viewed against the littered murky landscape of personal failure and Mockingbird, NY, where the story starts. But when the story shifts location - in the first of several deeply satisfying views of fair-handed fate - the choppiness of the words begin to work in concert with the setting. Words that sounded unnatural and coarse describing suburban life are perfect when describing the Newfundland coast line and the direct, honest, self-possesed people who live there. As the characters grow and gain depth, the language fits them more and more clearly.Proulx describes a world that could hardly be more concrete and weaves in thrilling bits of magic. She doesn't water down an incredibly hard life but weaves in the certainty that it's a also a good life. In the end, she's created a lovely, satisfying book without the slightest hint of syrup, contrivance or manipulation. Lovely, lovely, lovely. I hated to see it end."

I am glad that I put these challenges for me and because of them I am reading all these different books. Some proved to be disaster, others just made me fall in love with themselves. This book is somewhere in between. Neither I hated nor I loved it.The Shipping News revolve around Quoyle who had a tough childhood and equally tough twenties. After the death of his wife he moved back to Newfoundland, Canada, his original home. There he changed himself into a responsible father, and a person people look up to when they think that they are in need of help and this person will never disappoint them.I really loved the transformation part. How Quoyle started connecting with the people in this small coastal town. His friendship with Dennis, friction and loyalty at his office with colleagues, all was described in a lively manner. Beside that language was really beautiful.But the two things that i didn't like about it and which also made me remove two stars from my rating 1) the parts about fishing and boating lessons and how one could be perfect in them, 2) the end was not what i expected. While first put me to sleep, in second i was most disappointed. It fell a little too short of my expectations.I just fell in love with the writing so I am definitely reading another book by Annie Proulx."

        "user_review": "I wanted to start off my Pulitzer Prize Challenge--I'm trying to get in a winner once a month during 2020--with a book I'd been meaning to get to for some time. E. Annie Proulx'sThe Shipping Newsis pretty well regarded, but also happens to be about my adopted home province. Amidst a record-breaking and city-closingsnow stormI read through the most of this ode to Newfoundland culture and lifestyle. Though I'd really hoped to like or even love this book, it failed to really grab me with its character-driven narrative.That's in no small part to the gloomy and miserable life of Quoyle. The poor dude just can't seem to catch a break, and though he eventually finds his place in his ancestral home, it's a bit of a boring journey to get there. I'm willing to concede that to a person unfamiliar with Newfoundland this book could have a lot of charm: it's got reflections of people I've known even if some bits feel a bit outdated. I think Proulx does The Rock justice, but it just didn't end up being my cup of tea.Even though this fell flat for me, I can appreciate Proulx's writing and her incorporation of Newfoundland slang, places, and people. I liked some of the book's philosophy, but won't be flipping through the pages when I walk by it on the shelf. Ah well, a bit of a shame that it didn't work for me, but there's lots of other Pulitzer's in my future! [2.5 Stars]This is the first book in my 2020 Pultizer Challenge!"

But there are a few out there that have very distinct writing styles that set them apart, that give them a unique and recognizable identity. Annie Proulx is one of those. Margaret Atwood, Dorothy Allison, and Markus Zusak also come to mind for me.I've often wondered about Newfoundland, what it's like, what the people are like, would I enjoy living there. Through Annie Proulx words I feel like I have a sense for what it's like, right or wrong, I don't know. The setting and the characters became real to me while reading The Shipping News. They have their troubles, present and past, in this bleak and often harsh environment, but they are likeable for the most part.The quality of the writing made this an easy and enjoyable read for me. It's certainly deserving of it's awards and acclaim."

        "user_review": "Faust: First Part (Goethe's Faust #1), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Peter Salm (Translator)Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust is a tragic play in two parts usually known in English as Faust, Part One and Faust, Part Two.Faust is considered by many to be Goethe's magnum opus and the greatest work of German literature.The principal characters of Faust Part One include:Heinrich FaustMephistopheles, the DevilGretchen, Faust's love (short for Margarete; Goethe uses both forms)Marthe, Gretchen's neighbourValentin, Gretchen's brotherWagner, Faust's attendantFaust, Part One takes place in multiple settings, the first of which is Heaven. The demon Mephistopheles makes a bet with God: he says that he can lure God's favourite human being (Faust), who is striving to learn everything that can be known, away from righteous pursuits.The next scene takes place in Faust's study where Faust, despairing at the vanity of scientific, humanitarian and religious learning, turns to magic for the showering of infinite knowledge.He suspects, however, that his attempts are failing. Frustrated, he ponders suicide, but rejects it as he hears the echo of nearby Easter celebrations begin.He goes for a walk with his assistant Wagner and is followed home by a stray poodle.In Faust's study, the poodle transforms into Mephistopheles. Faust makes an arrangement with him: Mephistopheles will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on Earth, and in exchange Faust will serve the Devil in Hell.Faust's arrangement is that if he is pleased enough with anything Mephistopheles gives him that he wants to stay in that moment forever, then he will die in that moment. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز یازدهم ماه می سال 1991میلادیبخش نخست با مقدمه‌ ای در باب «بهشت» آغاز می‌شود؛ خداوند بنا به خواهش «شیطان» به او اجازه می‌دهد، تا درستی و راستی «فاوست»، خدمتگزار خدا را آزمایش کند؛ «مفیستوفلس»، با «فاوست» سالخورده معامله‌ ای می‌کند؛ اگر «فاوست» برای یک لحظه با این معامله موافقت کند، روح از تنش پرواز خواهد کرد؛ «فاوست» دوباره جوان می‌شود، و با «مفیستوفلس» به مسافرت می‌پردازد، تا از تمام لذایذ زمینی برخوردار گردد؛ در زمین عاشق دختر ساده‌ ای به نام «مارگارت» می‌شود، سپس به او خیانت می‌کند، و مسئول سقوط و مرگ او می‌شود؛ «مفیستوفلس» گمان می‌کند، که روح «مارگارت» را اسیر خواهد کرد، ولی صفای عشق او نسبت به «فاوست» و خودداری او از نجات یافتن از چنگال مرگ، سبب نجات او می‌شود؛ بخش نخست نمایش به پایان می‌رسد ولی «فاوست» هنوز در دنیای شهوات و هوس‌ها، آن لحظه پر شکوه هستی را که در آرزوی به چنگ آوردنش است، نیافته است...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 05/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 06/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

        "user_review": "I reread Faust yesterday, and it left me wondering ... pondering ... again ... as so often!Why don't we talk more about Gretchen? And I mean Gretchen as a subject, not as a toy to be used by Faust and Mephistopheles in their joint midlife crisis distractive game?Why don't we talk more about the amazing achievements of the modern world, in which a brother like Valentin wouldn't get to call his sister a whore for having a lover? Why don't we talk more about the bliss of choice? Gretchen today could have her dark affair with a middle-aged charismatic narcissist and then raise a child on her own. She doesn't have to die (or marry to become Dorothy to Casauban or Effi to Innstetten either!). Let us celebrate the end of Gretchen's life as a social evil and the beginning of Gretchen as a sexual being without guilt, shame and doom? The world will never be free from Faustian egomaniacs, but they may face women who speak up and expect more than Gretchen ever could for herself. Gretchen lived too early, too much.Just some thoughts on reading Faust yet again!This is not a review. More a continued discussion with myself on a play that keeps challenging me since high school.I cannot attempt to write a review of Goethe's Faust. It is a much too personal experience, growing with each time I reread it. Since high school, I have been thinking at least five times:\"This is the perfect Goethe moment, his work is written for ME, NOW, it can't get any better, deeper, or any more satisfying.\"Well, apparently it can. After maybe three or four years, I picked up Faust again, and found that I had finally grown up enough to identify with his most famous quote, the one I had reverently learned by heart as a student.Banging my head against the wall today while marking papers, trying to figure out how to explain the developments in the world to my own children and the adolescents I am in charge of, I looked up and literally felt Mephisto's presence in the room. Unable to get rid of the feeling, I looked at my shelf with my all time favourites, picked up my Faust, with its almost broken spine, and opened it to read ...... my own life ......the struggle to find answers, the longing for knowledge and understanding, the futile hope that my teaching will make a difference, and the creepy, scary thought that it might all be meaningless, because the majority of our planet is sold, body and soul, to devilish shallowness and indifference.... It almost sets my heart burning ...\"Now here I am, a fool for sure!No wiser than I was before:Master, Doctor's what they call me,And I've been ten years, already,Crosswise, arcing, to and fro,Leading my students by the nose,And see that we can know - nothing!It almost sets my heart burning.\"\"Da steh ich nun, ich armer Tor!Und bin so klug als wie zuvor;Heiße Magister, heiße Doktor garUnd ziehe schon an die zehen JahrHerauf, herab und quer und krummMeine Schüler an der Nase herum –Und sehe, daß wir nichts wissen k��nnen!Das will mir schier das Herz verbrennen.\"As hopeless as the message and the rest of the Faust plot is, it gave me solace to share this moment, yet again, with the master of masters, Goethe.Now here I am, a fool for sure!"

Rarely have I encountered prose thatcomminglesin such bounty thetrifectaof being, at once,gorgeousto the eye, imbued withpassionand saturated with depth andmeaning. Faust has all three and I was pulled into the seductive narrative from the momentous opening (wonderfully titled \"Prologue from Heaven\") through the final dramatic climax.I must briefly pause here to add a qualifier to my comments which relate to the version I experienced and not to my enjoyment of it.***Audible.com, usually a professional, high quality purveyor pulled a bit of a bamboozle on me in this case. I acquired the \"unabridged\" reading (by full cast) which came in at 4 hours in length. Now, that is just about right for Part 1 of Faust and so I thought I was in for a treat as I listened along with my own copy of the novel. Turns out, much to my chagrin, that the 4 hours was an \"adaptation\" of both Parts 1 and 2. Thus, as wonderful as the experience was, I did not get a chance to absorb all of the detail and nuances of the story.I plan to read the complete Faust (Parts 1 and 2) in the future and will share my thoughts on the work as a whole at that time.***End sad story pauseSo God, like a lonely parent maybe in need of a hug, allows Satan to throw a temptation Faust's way to prove that the man is still \"of the flock\" in a scaled down,boil-free, version of the Book of Job. As my introductory quote illustrates, Faust is a brilliant scholar who has completed a study of all the world's knowledge (and I thought I read a lot) and yet feels no wiser for the accomplishment. Feeling that there is more to existence than rote knowledge of the past (which echoes Goethe's own belief in the primacy of emotion over reason) Faust longs for deeper meaning and understanding that is hidden from him. He becomes depressed and contemplating suicide (Goethe's non-subtle hint that Faust's faith is more than a tad shaky allow the Devil \"access\" to him).Faust is visited by Mephistopheles and offered a life of hedonistic excess and earthly pleasures as a means of gaining greater understanding of the universe.Faust, who apparently had never watched any episodes ofThe Twilight Zone, foolishly agrees and bargains away his soul. Faust will die and the Devil will win if Faust can ever be made to be \"content\" with a moment in his life.If ever I lie down in sloth and base inaction, / Then let that moment be my end! / If by your false cajolery / You lull me into self-sufficiency, / If any pleasure you can give / Deludes me, let me cease to live! / I offer you this wager!\"From here the two take flight (literary) on a world-wind tour of debauchery and more debauchery.\"Let's plunge ourselves into the roar of time, the whirl of accident; may pain and pleasure, success and failure, shift as they will -- it's only action that can make a man.\"Soon after this, we are introduced to Gretchen, the other main player in this tragedy, whose relationship with Faust will explore key issues of faith and redemption. It was this relationship that I thought received the shortest shrift in the adaptation that I listened to so I will leave further thoughts on this until I have experienced the complete work.The language is gorgeous and drips emotion on almost every line. Some might think this falls too far into the realm of melodrama, but I loved it and found it vigorous and passionate. The end is wonderful with the necessary questions answered but certain larger queries left for us to contemplate.A wonderful experience (abridged though it may have been) and one that I strongly encourage everyone to read.4.0 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!P.S. I didn't have a place to slide this into my review, but I wanted to share one last quote from the story, this one from the devil. He and Faust have begun their tour of vice and come across a coven of witches who don't recognize the Prince of Lies.\"Do you know me now? Skinny, cadaverous bitch, / do you know your lord and master? Why don't I / Smash you to pieces, tell me why, / You and your ape-familiars? Must I teach / You some respect for my red doublet? What / Is this cock's feather, eh? My face / have I been hiding it? You learn your place, / Old hag! Am I to name myself or not?\"Good, good stuff."

        "user_review": "I readJohann Goethe's Faust in English and partially in German during a college course many years ago. It had a huge impact on me as a person and me as a writer. Due to it being somewhat \"out there,\" I held back a full 5 rating; however, I cannot stress how much this book makes you think. Beware, it's a little heavy on the literary side, but it's still worth a read, even if you just read the first portion. That said, 4 out of 5 stars...Detailed Review(about 1/3 of a paper I wrote about it a few years ago)When I first picked up Goethe's famous masterpiece Faust, I was hesitant about reading it. I read Goethe's work while lying on my bed a few hours before I went to sleep. My room was quiet because everyone else was already asleep. I was able to read and consciously take in the contents of the work. I generally don't like to be told what literature to read; however, after reading through the Prologue in Heaven, I was intrigued by the plot of Faust. As I began reading the first part, I was a bit disturbed by the fact that it was not in prose, but that it was in poetical verse. I have never been a great fan of poetry as a genre of literature. Thus I had mixed feelings when it came to reading Goethe's famous literary work Faust from the beginning.I wanted to learn something from the story, as I do from all literature. Authors don't just write for 'no' reason; they wish to accomplish something. I then strove to understand the reasons for the literary work's existence. When I skimmed Faust for the first time, I tried to read it for pleasure, but it was a little too hard. I needed to stop and understand what as going on in each scene. However, I soon realized that I was able to place myself inside the text in several different ways. It was at this point that Faust actually appealed to me; I saw myself in the novel as the character of Faust, fighting against the devilish Mephistopheles. I have always struggled with wanting everything from material things to the admiration of others. As a man of flesh and blood, I naturally want great intelligence, power and love. I have always wanted to be number one - a perfectionist - just like Faust.So, while I was reading Faust, I was truly reading a biography of my own life, albeit on a much larger scale. I too have lost some faith in my religion, and I wonder if I will be saved; however, unlike Faust, at the time I read it, I had yet to want someone as much as he wanted Margaret (Gretchen). Maybe if I were under the devil's spells like Faust was, I would have fallen just as hard for the woman. I do have the addictive personality that would lead me in the same direction as Faust. With all of this in mind, I read through the novel as though I were Faust. I took on his persona, argued with Mephistopheles, and wished that I had never been born in the end of the work. It is not easy to live a life completely free from the clutches of evil. When you are hopeless and in despair, you need help. Often, humans are not strong enough to recognize from whom they are getting help. Faust enabled me to foresee what would happen to me if I were subject to the devil's influence.Faust is a man worthy of my admiration. All throughout the book, both Faust and the actions he sought fascinated me. Like I said before, I felt as though I was reading or watching a movie of my own life. It was as though a dream had come true where I was able to align myself with the devil. The fears that I have in reality weren't present enough in my dreams to stop myself from associating with some Mephistophelean devil. I was able to see what would happen if I took on the persona of evil incarnate turned into man. Faust enabled me to have an out of body experience where I could see what would happen to me if I became what I have always been curious about becoming: A devil-influenced man.Throughout the work of Faust by Goethe, I was able to live experiences vicariously. Faust enabled me to try things that I only dreamed about trying. I really felt as though I were reading a novel about myself. I think that this is why the Faustian theme has persisted throughout time; men (and women) everywhere have struggled within themselves fighting between good and evil to achieve their goals and desires. I am no different.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

        "user_review": "YouTube kitap kanalımda hayatımda yarım bıraktığım ilk kitap olanFausthakkında konuştum:youtu.be/g0tV0SSIK2kGoethe 14 yaşındayken buharlı makine icat edilmiş, 21 yaşındayken Hegel doğmuş, 40 yaşındayken Fransız İhtilali olmuş, 66 yaşındayken Waterloo Savaşı olmuş.Ben 26 yaşındayken ise hayatımın en önemli gündemikoronavirüsişte.Faust'u ben yazamazdım, hatta sadece ben değil, Goethe'den başka da kimse yazamazdı. Latince'de faustus mutlu olmaya yazgılı olmak demekti zaten. Şeytan onun ruhunu çalıp ona hüküm kurmak istese bile mutlu olmaya, Tanrı ile olmaya yazgılı bir insandı Faust. Sanayi Devrimi'nin insanları koşullandırdığı her şeyi bilme diktesinde olan bir çağda o da her şeyi bilmek isteyenlerden başka bir şey değildi. Bu konuda Goethe'nin bir fikri vardı.26 yaşındayken bir toplantıda tanıştığı Weimar dükü, Goethe'ye, gel kardo burada takıl hem Faust'u bitirirsin hem de kitabın son şeklini burada alır dedi ama beklemediği bir şey oldu Goethe'nin, o da Weimar klasisizmi. Schiller'in de içinde bulunduğu Fırtına ve Coşku akımına nazaran Weimar klasisizmi, gestalt, gehalt ve inhalt adı verilen içerik, Yunan ilhamı ve estetik öncüllerinden oluşurdu. Yani Puşkin'in üç güvenilir kartı tutumluluk, ölçülülük ve çalışkanlık, Reich'in üç erdemi sevgi, çalışma ve bilgi, ilk mimarlık kuramcısı Vitruvius'un iyi bir mimari tasarım için belirlediği üç öncül fayda, kalıcılık ve güzellikti ya, işte Goethe'nin de kendisi için belirlediği muhteşem üçlü bunlardı.Zaten Goethe'nin sanat ülküsü, \"İnsan hayatını, dünyayı, öteki alemleri, hatta ahireti de büyük tabiatın cüzleri olarak ele almak ve ahenkli bir bütünlük içinde hepsinin yerini ve rolünü göstermek\"ti. Sadece bu dünyanın varlığını değil, öte yaşamın varlığını da bir bütün içinde değerlendirerek, gestalt'a, yani parçaların barındığı bütüne ulaşabilmekti Goethe'nin amacı.Albert Camus'nün Tersi ve Yüzü kitabında kendi felsefesini ve kendi madalyonunu dünya-insan ikiliğiyle kurması gibi Goethe de kendi madalyonunu üç taraflı kurmuştu: Tanrı-şeytan-insan. Yani Ivan Karamazov'un yaşadığı ve cebelleştiği üçlü.Ama Nietzsche Goethe'ye o öldükten yıllar sonra \"Alman dilinin baş mimarı Goethe'dir.\" demişti. Goethe de belki bunu hissetmiş olacak ki, Faust'u neredeyse Nietzsche'nin Dionysoscu içkin üstinsanı olarak tasarlamıştı. Dinamikti, kabına sığmıyordu, aktifti, her şeyi bilmek istiyordu Faust, mutlak mükemmeliyeti arıyordu fakat her insanın düştüğü yanılgı gibi ruhunu şeytana satmıştı. Faust'un şeytanı şeytan fakat belki de bizim de para, iktidar, ün, şehvet hırslarımız da kendi şeytanlarımız olabilir. Faust, Yunan mitolojisindeki Helena ile karşılaşsa bile bu ona yetmemişti, daha çok şeyi bilip o bildiklerini Kubrick'in 2001: Bir Uzay Destanı filmindeki monolite aktarmak istemişti belki.Hatta ve hatta İncil'in başlangıcı olan Yuhanna \"Başlangıçta söz vardı.\" şeklinde başlıyorsa, Dostoyevski'nin İncil'i \"Başlangıçta acı vardı.\" Goethe'nin İncil'i ise \"Başlangıçta eylem vardı.\" şeklinde olurdu. Çünkü Ruslar acıyla, Almanlar eylemle varoluşlarına ulaşırdı.Faust kitabının cevap aradığı iki soru vardı en nihayetinde:1- İnsan tam olarak nefsini şeytana teslim edip sapıklığa düştükten sonra, kendi kuvveti ile doğru yolu bulabilir mi bulamaz mı?2- Ölümlü bir insan için durulacak ve geçilmeyecek anlar var mıdır?Ben cevaplayayım...1- Evet.2- Evet.Başta yazdığım filmi de izleyin bu arada kesin. Bir de Roman Polanski'den Rosemary'nin Bebeği izlerseniz üstüne çok iyi cila olur."

        "user_review": "I had to read this for my German class - sure, this is not the ideal starting point for a book but is definitely not the reason why I hated it so much. I disliked the book because of how problematic it is.Let's get something clear - I am 16 years old and definitely not the original target group for this book. I am queer and a feminist. I am educated and know my rights. So pretty much the opposite of a woman back in the 19th century, when the first part was written.I still am able to appreciate Goethe as a poet and an important historical figure.Sure, this book is very much quoteable - Goethe was a poet afterall. But a book is about more than just pretty quotes.And yes, I do get that this book is a very important monument in literature bla bla blaI knowBut this doesn't make a book good, you know?Warning: the rest includes spoilers!The figure of Faustdisgustedme. He basically is an old but well educated white guy in his mid life crisis. And Fausts character was only aggravated after he met Mephisto.And now let's take some time to look at Faust and to find out why I hate him so much.My passionate hate for Faust was born early: when he tried to kill himself. (starting at line 690, even though I can only quote my German edition)He basically tried to kill himself because he was bored and felt like crossing a border. Nice, I know. But let's give Goethe a pass on that because a play needsdrama, right?But it only gets worse! I almost screamed when Faust met Margarete, or as he calls her:Gretchen.Gretchen? How old is she supposed to be? Like 6 years?No, she actually is 14! As if this would make such a difference. And let's not forget that Faust was, evenafterhis literalrejuvenation, around 50 years old! That makes him not only nasty but also pedophile!He is 50 years old and makes a 14 year old fall in love with him and that only because he forces her to! This is in no way art and if you don't think there's anything wrong with that, what is wrong withyou.He literally breaks into her house too! He walks around smelling at her clothes and looking at her room - I'd call this a creep and a stalker, just saying.During their so-called 'relationship' he makes her feel bad for being less educated than he is (starting line 3215). Quite disgusting if you ask me.He also kills her mother and his brother. This relationship is absolute #goals.But well, Gretchens brother was quite an idiot too. He likes to brag with his sister being a virgin (line 3630 following) and slut shames her when she's not a virgin anymore. (line 3736) #goalsThere's also a brief mention of Faust being antisemitic (line 2841) but I'll give a concerned pass on that when you look at the time period Goethe was living in.Okay, let's summarise thismasterpiecepiece ofart.Threedifferent preludes for an unfinished almost autobiographical story about an old white guy experiencing a crisis? \"No\" (line 2668)"

        "user_review": "Faustby Goethe was the very first book (apart from textbooks, of course) I ever put my hands on. It was assigned to me when I was in middle school for my Spanish class. I know it's a German play, but the teacher was encouraging us to read by asking the whole classroom to donate a book for the course, put it in a box with the others and then randomly pick up one of them each month — now that I think of it, the teacher should have payed more attention to the books we brought, since I don't thinkFaustwas appropriate for a twelve-year-old. I chose, however, this play by Goethe, having no idea what it was about. And, well, I remained so for twelve years more, since I never read more than ten pages perhaps, until four days ago that I finally got a copy of it. Unlike many readers I know, I didn't acquire my taste for literature and reading from an early age; I didn't grew up reading stories and I didn't ever feel like I was immersed in a magic world of fantastic creatures and rainbows — what some people claim literature is about. Instead, I got interested in such delightful activities for two main reasons. One of them was that I was a Radiohead fan in high school and there'sthis songbased on Orwell's1984, but I was told that it was based onAnimal Farm(false), so I thought it would be a good idea to read it. The other reason is that by this same time I took a philosophy course and I remember I was so amazed by Plato's allegory of the cave that I finally decided I wanted to know more about life, and I thought books had the answers of the many questions I asked myself and everything I wanted to know; that within their pages I was going to findtheanswer. Now that I've read a little bit more, I've come to realize that literature is such a passionate and sublime art indeed, but it hardly provides answers and it actually makes you question more and more — which is great, don't get me wrong, for it makesyoutry harder to think for yourself — but I'd say one answer makes two more questions. In this everlasting search for meaning I found myself in Dr. Heinrich Faust, the main character in this poetic play. Even though, unlike him, I haven't studiedphilosophy, medicine and theology with ardent zeal, I do feel like awretched fool. I think Goethe's point was to make an emphasis in this lack of something in human understanding and that no matter how hard we try there'll be always something greater than us that we won't be able to understand with our minds designed for only three dimensions, likeIvan Karamazovsaid. It's important to take into consideration the fact that Goethe did believe in God, that for him, God was this higher being that begot mankind; but he was not in favor of the way the Church was organized; and both, believes and disbelieves are brought up to discussion throughout the whole play. He believed, for instance, that God made the Universe perfect and so did the Angels believed; but that's when Mephistopheles, the fallen angel, enters the scene, asking for permission to say a word. He says the Universe isn't perfect since Man still feels miserable. Then he makes a wager with God upon Faust's soul, with arguments based on the book of Job, that is, that if Faust's life is changed by blow after blow of tragedy, he would stop being God's faithful son, though unlike the Biblical character, who at the end realises about God's highness, in this play Faust seems to be more and more miserable. Also, there's the fact that inJobthe fallen angel didn't exactly hang out with him, like Mephisto did with Faust. Thus, when the man's life comes to an end, he on whose side Faust is, will keep his soul. Therefore, there are many converging points in both books, but they differ from each other.So Faust is a very learned man who has studied everything that ever existed, and yet he still feels he's missing something about existence, something that isn't written down in those books and that perhaps cannot be put to words. He even struggles while trying to translate the wordlogosin the Gospel of Luke:\"In the beginning was the Word\".He wonders whether it was the deed instead of the word, because he feels that words, literacy, do not lit his soul the way perhaps a passionate deed would. He then expresses the words that have become famous because of their depth and their importance in this work:'Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast, each seeks to rule without the other.'Thus, he begins to look beyond theories and tries something new: magic and alchemy. I don't want to get into specific details about the plot,  but there's a point when he summons the Earth Spirit, something that according to some sources, was Goethe's own contribution to his supernatural play, being no former record of such a spirit either in Christianity or in pagan mythology — I think for Goethe, the Earth Spirit represented an instance of God, like when Moses saw the brush burned in fire. And it's the Spirit who lowers this learned man to his human condition, making him aware of his delimited understanding. Faust, however, persists and trying to prove his godliness, he tries to commit suicide, when suddenly the the church bells ring and an angelic choir from above is heard, announcing Christ's resurrection. Later in the play, Faust finds a lost poodle and takes it home, when suddenly the animal reshapes into Mephistopheles, who unlike the Earth Spirit, makes the doctor believe he can achieve anything if he stays with him and serves him when his soul leaves his body; to which Faust answers that little does he care for the afterlife when all he wants is to actuallyfeelhe's livingthislife. The agreement is settled with blood.\"Gray, my friend, is every theory,and green alone life's golden tree.\"Then at a witch's place, Faust sees a beautiful woman in the mirror and he asks Mephisto to grant him the wish of possessing so beautiful a woman and after some mumbo-jumbo by the witch, he takes a potion of sorts to achieve his passionate goals. Then he meets Gretchen, also known as Margaret, and that's what Faust's misery gets worse — and even worse for Gretchen, who before meeting Faust and his horrid companion was such a pure creature that at first Mephisto does not think he can get her. Eventually Gretchen is persuaded by Faust enchantments — of course, gotten by such a supernatural aid — but as her passion towards Faust increases, misfortune falls upon her family, until the final disgrace comes, before which Faust is ushered by Mephisto to the  Walpurus Night: an exotic event hosted by witches and having paganism as entertainment — I guess it's like the Super Bowl for witches. Later, we find out that during this exotic and frightful evening, Gretchen lost her mind after his brother, murder by Faust's evil companion, called her a whore in his last adieu, so she drowns her baby, is taken to prison and given a death sentence. Faust blames Mephistopheles for distracting him at the Walpurus Night instead of taking him to save Gretchen. This is when I realised Goethe used Mephisto to point out the flaws of our minds, sometimes in earnest, sometimes in jest, like people's tendency to blame external, sometimes supernatural causes for their mistakes. Gretchen's given the chance to scape prison helped by her lover and his friend, but instead of going evil ways, she chooses what would seem as tragedy and condemnation to some, like Mephistopheles, but under the gaze of the Heavenly, she's saved, leaving an open door for Faust to go the same way and make the right decision. I'm afraid Goethe wrote the second part until the last year of his life. The redirection of Margarete's path was perhaps inevitable once she entered Faust's toxic influence, but in the end she had the chance to choose either condemnation or salvation, and perhaps that's Goethe's main point: to remark virtue through iniquity. It works similarly, perhaps, as Milton did in hisParadise Lost.As a matter of fact, like the latter took the epic poems as notary influence, Shakespeare had the same kind of impact with the author ofFaust— nonetheless, his gift and his technique stand on their own.This is a must-read classic and it is one of those books I calla literary delight.But all the subjects I've tried (perhaps unsuccessfully) to expose in this review are precisely the reasons why I don't thinkFaustis a good choice for a twelve-year-old beginner. Not because of its difficulty, but I think as one grows older one has a better chance of appreciating Goethe's perfectly constructed verses, of having a different perspective upon all the sorrowful, theological, obscure and erotic points by him exposed. It's frightening yet beautiful; it's heavenly yet humane; it's a play and a poem. I'm not as learned as Doctor Faust, but I think I found in reading this book the kind of fervor he was looking for.\"I awake with horror in the morning,and bitter tears well up in mewhen I must face each day that in its coursecannot fulfill a single wish, not one!\"[Faust and the Earth Spirit. Illustrated by Goethe himself.]"

        "user_review": "There's something discomforting about the vague moral convictions of Goethe's Faust character. One would assume, that even a scholar living in Goethe's time would find the typical preoccupations of Christian morality somewhat boring, if not basically delusional and overzealous. After all, the cacophony of self-doubt racing through his mind is not initially brought on by anything that resembles religious guilt. He's a man plagued by the hermetic stuffiness of a lifestyle of perpetual deep thought. All of his forced questions about the complexity of the universe have not been adequately revealed to him in the immense amount of reading and study that he has undertaken throughout the course of his life. Something is missing. In the opening soliloquy he desperately gropes out loud in an attempt to locate the source of his emptiness. He intones ...\"What theatre! Oh, but nothing more.Where can I grasp you, never-ending Nature?Breasts, where? You founts of all of life,That earth and heaven hang upon loveAnd where the parched soul craves to be,You flow, you give to drink, but not to me.\"Of course, much of this monologue does hint at the power that God might potentially have to grant this wish, but Goethe is ambiguous at best. In the beginning it's difficult to tell whether Faust harbors any faith in God. The question of God's abilities and/or existence is a concern of Faust's, but his frustrations and lamentations seem more bestial and secular in tone. Faust desires some sort of ineffable experience; he desires a base inflammation of the senses, most importantly of his own passion for life. It could be argued that Mephistopheles appears essentially because Faust desires to lose himself in sublime sinfulness. God might only show up to suggest that his mortal frustrations and complex questions can in fact be answered, but only by one book. More importantly, if it were for the grace of God's true presence in Faust's existence, his questions would abate under the reverent awe of his own faith. It's obviously not there.It's at this point that Mephistopheles appears, offering what any average mortal would desire in the throes of their own suffering, brought on by an overwhelming abundance of probing, difficult questions; namely the earthly pleasures of amorous love. To be clear, Gretchen's character is offered to Faust to appease the longings of his heart more than that of his loins. Having the position and immortal power that Mephistopheles does, he understands that Faust will be more than willing to accept his wager. But, as most critics suggest, Mephistopheles also knows that a character such as Faust, despite not really being a man of faith, will ruin such an immediate route to happiness. Naturally, Gretchen detects the way in which this internal struggle of Faust's causes him to be so distant. Not only that, but she distrusts Mephistopheles, and is committed to God.There is a clunky and somewhat fragmented quality to the way that Goethe presents many of the difficult concerns of Faust and his wager with Mephistopheles. Initially, he is so troubled, merely by the thought that all of his worldly academic efforts are made in vain. His frustration with the futility of his effort to enlighten himself and to better understand the beautiful complexity of the world, reaches a sort of peak, at which point he loses faith in virtually everything. At first amused by the idea of the very appearance of Mephistopheles, he's eventually perplexed by how effortlessly he can access the very happiness which he could hardly even give a name to. Is he, in this sense, troubled once again by the knowledge that he possesses, the knowledge of the disappointing outcome of his temporary pleasures? One could almost draw a parallel to Nietzsche's description of the existential frustration that cripples Shakespeare's Hamlet from acting on his anger due to the knowledge that he has of the awful situation occurring around him.To an atheist, especially an academic one, virtually all of this might sound a little silly. The reality of the situation is that Mephistopheles is actually quite fun. As he says in response to Faust's question of who Mephistopheles is, \"A part of the power who wills evil always but always works the good.\" He perplexes Faust by presenting himself as a merely a part of a duality that constitutes peoples paradoxical understanding of the wholeness of God. This might sound confusing to some, but what he's doing is mockingly suggesting to Faust that his attachment to traditional notions of sin and goodliness is ridiculous. Toward the end, Faust ignorantly insists that the wager is destined to end in despair and disappointment. Mephistopheles, already aware of how seemingly full of disappointment most mortal situations might appeal to human beings, basically has a little fun with Faust's misguided convictions of goodness. So then is this a tragedy? Toward the end of the first part of Goethe's morally confusing masterpiece, it becomes increasingly difficult to believe that there is anything tragic about the fate of Faust."

It has, of course inspired operas from Berlioz to Busoni and books writers such as Thomas Mann.

        "user_review": "Goethe's Faust is a novel rich in metaphor, elaborate verse, imagery, depth, and meaning that not only employs symbolic characters and scenes, but also through such literary techniques weaves its main philosophy of striving and experience as mankind's rightful path.Ironically, Faust reveals his disapproval for books as a true source of knowledge in understanding the world; we must turn to life and living, and experience instead. I call this ironic because while he denounces books, Faust is a book. The text itself seems to imply that although it's imbued with intense profundity, one must \"live\" it in order to truly understand it. That is to say, reading doesn't do its inherent meaning justice.This does not, however, mean that Goethe's Faust is inaccessible and as useless as the moth and cobweb infested library of Faust's room, instead, Goethe breaks this obstacle to grant the reader a qualitative experience of his philosophy that sidesteps the barriers of denotation. since Goethe presents us a Play as opposed to a documentation of thought on his philosophies, he doesn't tell us about striving and experience, he shows us."

There are parts of this play/poem which seem to capture the whole drama of Man's fall and redemption within a single rhyming couplet. David Constantine's translation modernizes this amazing piece of High German lit, but George Madison Priest's translation seems, at least to me, to have a more seductive flow and more tempting poetry."

        "user_review": "Who knew that this book, one of the most famous in literature, was actually two separate works that seem only slightly related? I certainly didn't. The first part is a fairly ordinary play that gets dunked in profundity through the inclusion of Mephistopheles. There are only a few main characters here, and there wasn't much depth to any of them. I've heard that the German is tremendously good, but it's impossible for me to judge. I switched back and forth in this part between two different translations. I liked the free kindle version better than my Oxford edition, but I wasn't really taken in with the language of either, except in some small parts. On its own, I have to say that I enjoyed the first part.The second part is unlike anything I've ever read. If I didn't know that it had been invented in my lifetime, I'd swear that Goethe got himself into some very, very fine LSD. It's very weird, jumps all over the place, and gives the impression that anything, no matter how fantastical, could be made to occur. It feels like it could never be produced as a play. There are way too many speakers -- I hesitate to call any of them characters. In this second part, a mood might start talking, or a mythological creature, or an inanimate object, or anything at all for that matter. And I have no idea how, if staged, anyone would know which \"character\" was speaking at any time. (Unless, like in a childrens play, Thales or Speed-Booty, wore a placard saying who he was.)The stage directions can be just as dumbfounding. At one point, one direction says: \"To the younger members of the audience who did not applaud.\" Now how exactly is one supposed to pull that direction off in a manner that is at all intelligible? What if the entire audience applauded? It is one of the stranger directions I've ever seen in a play, and it made me think that Goethe may have been over a hundred years ahead of his time. Or maybe he just realized that this was a \"play\" that would only ever be read, and he was just having some fun with the directions.Ultimately, this work is a long piece of lyric poetry, and I'm willing to accept that in German it is remarkably great poetry. I suppose that people who don't speak English might have just as hard a time figuring out what's so great about Shakespeare, and that makes me sad. But, reading Proust made me decide to learn French. I never felt anything like that tug towards German while reading Faust."

Reading this book felt like being trapped in an elevator with the pathetic Scrubs douchebag (Zachy McWhinerson, or whatever his fracking name is) for an entire weekend. You know the type - the constant puppy need for the approval of every critter on the planet, all the time. It might seem like a charming vulnerability, but don't be fooled. It actually signals a pathological narcissist whose solipsism and incessant neediness will bleed you dry.I know, I know. Many fine books have been written about unlikable characters. Anyway, it's about the character's emotional growth. Etc. etc.All true. But when you find the central character so annoying that just reading about him makes you twitch, it's probably time to switch to another book.Your mileage may vary. For all I know, you're the kind of person who watches marathon \"scrubs\" reruns. If so, you'll probably love this book."

I browse, I choose, I read the blurbs inside, I deliberate, I read a chapter from ever book I've chosen.In short, I only read things I'm really likely to like.So, I will tell you right now, if there were a way to give [High Fidelity]sixstars, I would.Ostensibly it's a novel about pop music and love. But if that's what you're seeing, then you are reading it wrong.It's a novel about obsession, rejection and minutia. As such, [Nick Hornby] speaks directly to my geeky soul. Even though I'm not a music expert, I see a lot of myself in the main character Rob - escaping into pop, defining his life through records, filling his head with facts rather than feelings and trying, oh so desperately trying, to be a real human being.His relationships never last. If he's not outright rejected, thenhe'sthe one who gets full of himself and does the rejecting. He's not good with people, doesn't want to be, ultimately can't be. But he aches for them. He's a loner who can't bear to be alone. He pushes people away, but wonders why there aren't any people around.Every word in [High Fidelity] felt familiar, even with a location (London) and a milieu (music fandom) that are unfamiliar to me. Somehow, Hornby strikes this strange, compelling balance between being incredibly witty on the surface, and being incredibly depressing beneath.Swap out records for comics or videogames, and IamRob. If you're a geek, and a male, and a member of these recent lost generations of \"slackers\" and \"man-children\", then you are Rob, too."

I've dated three. They're so damned adorable and they're so damned attractive in their rugby shirts. . . until you realize by the third date that it's the only shirt they own.I once pulled up for a date with a Rob (because, naturally, he didn't have his own car), and he was sitting on the hood of a friend's car in a rugby shirt and sweat pants, his right forearm down to the elbow in a Jumbo size bag of Doritos. As I stopped my car, my headlights shone upon his visage, and he smiled a cheesy, Cheshire grin. God bless him, he was so happy to see me, but when he licked his orange fingertips as he walked over to my car, I will admit, here, publicly, that I pressed on the accelerator and drove off gently into that good night.

(Sometimes twice, depending upon the Rob).A Rob can break your heart with their fear of. . . everything.

We can call him Rob Fleming, but really he is John Cusack playing Rob Fleming. I haven't seen the movie, but I've seen enough clips from the movie to know that I can't read this book and see Fleming as anyone other than Cusack.He is thirty-five, and his girlfriend Laura has just packed up a suitcase and moved out. This is his seventeenth relationship, and every single one of them has ended the same way...in failure. Of course, moving out with a suitcase could be just a shot across his bow. Change, or else this will be a permanent situation. The apartment, though, is still brimming with her possessions, which means there are many more skirmishes to be fought and lines in the sand to be drawn. Laura has a new job, a grown up job, and her spiked hair is gone, and her leather jackets have been pushed to the back of her closet. She has changed. Rob has remained the same.Is this the age old problem of women wanting men to change and men wanting women to stay the same?Or it could be about Ian, the upstairs lothario who routinely serenaded them with the squeaks and groans of his epic bouts of sex. Is Laura's interest in Ian about curiosity? Does she want to see what all that moaning and groaning for hours is about? Rob is insecure about his sexual prowess, and thinking about Laura with Ian drives him crazy. Most men are bundles of masculine insecurities, especially regarding their sexual performance, and since Rob is a man who likes to make lists, he even has a list of all the things that can go wrong for men.\"There's the nothing-happening-at-all problem, the too-much-happening-too-soon problem, the dismal-droop-after-a-promising-beginning problem; there's the size-doesn't-matter-except-in-my-case problem, the failing-to-deliver-the-goods problem. A spot of I-wonder-how-I-rank?\"Fortunately, most of the time, a man's brain short circuits (blood flow to the mind is sent elsewhere), and he isn't worried about any of these things at the moment of impending coitos, or there would be more failures to launch and fewer successful liftoffs. But if a man is unfortunate enough to have any of these insecurities wiggle into his brain at the most inappropriate moment, it can lead to a less than satisfactory conclusion and a doubling down on his rampaging inferiority complex.Rob can no longer claim to be a kid, but he is far from an adult. He is trapped in an adolescent's view of life. He's afraid of commitment, but he flounders when he isn't in a relationship. It becomes obvious that Laura and Rob are miserable apart, but it doesn't take long to realize that Laura will have to be the one to take the initiative.I worked in a bookstore that also had a record/CD/cassette department. The people who worked in the music department were definitely different than the people who worked in the book department. We each had our own language, but of course, book people listened to music, and music people read books, so we did find ways to communicate. The list challenges that Rob and his workmates throw at each other are funny because we did that as well, pre-internet by the way. We had to pull our lists from our memory, which made for errors. I'd be driving home and suddenly remember a book that should have made my list of favorite fiction books featuring a real life person and be really irritated that I forgot it.I was just beginning to amass a book collection. Even though I had all these cheap books available to me to buy, I also had insufficient pay to buy them with, so fortunately, I didn't have the massive library that I have today or my future wife would have certainly dumped me, smartly so, for some guy with a BMW and an obsession with the stock market, rather than sticking with a nearsighted guy obsessed with musty old books. Rob asked the age old question,\"Is it possible to maintain a relationship and a large record [book] collection simultaneously?\"I can say, it is possible. I've been married for twenty-eight years and counting, but I would suggest a few things: don't expect her to be as obsessed about your collection as you are, keep your collection orderly and contained (as best you can), be able to maintain conversations about things other than your collection, watch a chick flick once in a while, grit your teeth and hang out with her \"normal\" friends occasionally and make her look good by being charming, and make sure the money you spend on your collection doesn't impact the normal flow of the family finances.I know it's a mental shift from being quite willing to eat beans for a month to buy that Cormac McCarthy first edition. I can tell you, she is not willing to do so, and that is a good thing. It's called having a more complete life.This is one of those books that makes you grin and wince in equal measure as you read it. Rob will have you thinking about your ten most embarrassing moments while dating, and as he makes his nostalgic tour back through all the women who left him looking for insight about himself (another problem that he suffers from is self-obsession), you will remember some of your own miscues with trying to form lasting relationships. I would have really enjoyed this book when it came out in 1995. I was 28 then, a bit younger than Rob, but still working in the book biz and certainly a bit bruised and battered by the dating wars. I would have probably found Rob's trials and tribulations more insightful than I do now, but regardless, I still enjoyed this quirky romp through a past not that dissimilar to the one I left strewn behind me.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeetenand an Instagram accounthttps://www.instagram.com/jeffreykeeten/"

Working with his archetypal characters mixing with a solid knowledge of music, Hornby's debut made me think a lot; it will also surely stir plenty fond memories to anyone who grew up in the late 20th Century. Fun and though provoking (if you want it to be) - 8 out of 12."

Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands—literally thousands—of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss. The unhappiest people I know, romantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know whether pop music has caused this unhappiness, but I do know that they've been listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living the unhappy lives....But there was an important and essential truth contained in the idea, and the truth was that these things matter, and it's no good pretending that any relationship has a future if your record collections disagree violently, or if your favorite films wouldn't even speak to each other if they met at a party.High Fidelitywouldn't work if it weren't so wonderfully, painfully funny. From the top-five lists, to the relentless bantering, to nearly everything Barry says or does, there's genuine humor that keeps you reading even once you realize that this book is no comedy. Rob can be and has been an awful person to Laura, and it's not clear whether he can repair their relationship or should even try. But the humor keeps things hopeful throughout that Rob will ultimately do the right thing, even when it's not clear what that is.I've been happily married for over 25 years. But before that, there were dating mishaps and breakups (a few of them with my future bride).High Fidelitycomes as close as any I've ever read to capturing the insecurities of the male ego, and the contradictions of male behavior, especially during a breakup. It's not a pretty picture, yet I can think of no higher praise for this book. Highly recommended.Update: I recently finished watching the Hulu series adaptation ofHigh Fidelity. It's solid, and it's disappointing that there won't be a second season. But the book is definitely better."

Also, I was a huge fan of the movie when it first came out, but this was my first time reading it.In some ways, Rob reminds me of myself back then: insecure, paranoid, over reactive, etc. I would think a girl was interested in me and call the over and over thinking that was the best way to win her heart. Then, when it didn't work, I would drown my sorrows in music . . . until I tried calling again. Now, I will say that Rob definitely goes a bit overboard in his relationships and how he approaches them are toxic. But, it is entertaining watching the trainwreck that is his life.I think to enjoy this book you need to be into the writing style; cynical, self-deprecating humor that leaves you wondering if you love all the characters or hate them. I know that this will not be everyone's cup of tea (ah, a British book, cup of tea, HA! I am here all night, folks!) I have been looking at some other reviews and it seems like a lot of people despise this one. I definitely get that – if this was not set during such an important time of my life and if it didn't mirror a lot of aspects of my social life at the time, I probably would be too turned off by the frustrating characters and Rob's basically inappropriate approach to every situation.But, nostalgia wins this time – now I have to go back and watch the movie again!"

        "user_review": "We all have a handful of books that we feel were written specifically for us, as if the author took us out for dinner and drinks (lots of drinks, on the author's tab) and interviewed us on the important things (in no particular order, except the order in which I thought of these): love, faith, art, sex, career, family, friends. Then they put our thoughts and feelings in a book.High Fidelityby Nick Hornby is one of those books for me, the account of a young man reorganizing his disappointments and his record collection following a rough break-up. I'm not the narrator and he's not me, but often wish life could be cataloged as clearly as my music.Published in 1995, Hornby's debut novel is the stoic, immature and unapologetic first-person account of Rob Fleming, a thirty-five-year-old who lives in a one-bedroom flat in the North London neighborhood of Crouch End. Rob owns a record shop called Championship Vinyl which specializes in\"punk, blues, soul, and R&B, a bit of ska, some indie stuff, some '60s pop--everything for the serious record collector\". His two employees and perhaps best friends-- the shy, awkward Dick and the loud, obnoxious Barry--pass the work day thinking and talking in lists: top five Dustin Hoffman films, top five Gerry and Sylvia Anderson shows, top five sweets that come in jars, etc.For us readers only, Rob categorizes his all-time, top five most memorable split-ups. He was 12 or 13 when Alison Ashworth ended their six-hour courtship for another boy. The following year, he broke off a three-month relationship with Penny Hardwick, a nice girl who rebuffed Rob's hormonal advances and as soon as he dumped her, devastated him by having sex with one of Rob's classmates. He was 17 when he pried away Jackie Allen from her perfect relationship for three weeks. The one he never got over was Charlie Nicholson, a college lover of two years whose beauty and airs intimidated him until she ended things. Rob found a kindred spirit at age 25 named Sarah Kendrew and stayed with her for two years out of loneliness until she met someone. The decision of his girlfriend Laura Lydon to move out doesn't make the list, apparently.Laura was, is, a lawyer, although when I met her she was a different kind of lawyer from the one she is now: then, she worked for a legal aid firm (hence, I guess, the clubbing and the black leather motorcycle jacket). Now, she works for a City law firm (hence, I guess, the restaurants and expensive suits and the disappearance of the spiky haircut and a previously unrevealed taste for weary sarcasm) not because she underwent any kind of political conversion, but because she was made redundant and couldn't find any legal aid work. She had to take a job that paid about forty-five grand a year because she couldn't find one that paid under twenty; she said this was all you need to know about Thatcherism, and I suppose she had a point. She changed when she got the new job. She was always intense, but, before, the intensity had somewhere to go: she could worry about tenants' rights, and slum landlords, and kids living in places without running water. Now she's just intense aboutwork--how much she has, the pressure she's under, how she's doing, what the partners think of her, that kind of stuff. And when she's not being intense about work, she's being intense about why she shouldn't be intense about work, or this kind of work, anyway.Newly single, Rob throws himself into a reorganization of his record collection (switching from alphabetical to autobiographical, filing his one-thousand album collection in the order he purchased them in). Dick and Barry drag him to a club to hear an American folk singer named Marie LaSalle, as lost and single in London as Rob is in his own neighborhood; Rob develops a crush on Marie that goes unrequited only so long. He touches base with Liz, a mutual friend of Laura's, and learns that his ex has moved in with Ian, their obnoxious former neighbor. In her talks with Laura, though, Liz has learned things about Rob that places him firmly in the \"arsehole\" category.I do not know what, precisely, Laura said, but she would have revealed at least two, maybe even all four, of the following pieces of information:1. That I slept with somebody else while she was pregnant.2. That my affair contributed directly to her terminating the pregnancy.3. That, after the abortion, I borrowed a large sum of money from her and have not yet repaid any of it.4. That, shortly before she left, I told her I was unhappy in the relationship, and I was kind of sort of maybe looking around for someone else.Did I do and say these things? Yes, I did. Are there any mitigating circumstances? Not really, unless any circumstantial (in other words, context) can be regarded as mitigating. And before you judge, although you have probably already done so, go away and write down the worst four things you have done to your partner, even if--especially if--your partner doesn't know about them. Don't dress these things up, or try to explain them; just write them down, in a list, in the plainest language possible. Finished? OK, so who's the arsehole now?Rob's lists help him through his breakup with Laura in one way, at least. He endeavors to contact each of his all-time top five most memorable split-ups to find closure. Maybe people can change: Dick stuns everyone by meeting an adorable young woman named Anna Moss, while Barry's musical delusions are answered when his seeking-work ad is finally answered and he becomes the front man of Sonic Death Monkey (née Barrytown). Distraught when he pesters Laura into admitting that she's had sex with Ian, Rob ends up on the invitation list for her father's funeral. Reconciliation seems likely, but the common denominator in all Rob's failures is still staring at him.2. (Seventh day, bed, afterward.)\"You really don't expect me to tell you.\"\"Why not?\"\"Because what purpose would it serve? I could describe every second of every time, and there weren't that many of them, and you'd be hurt, but you still wouldn't understand the first thing about anything that mattered.\"\"I don't care. I just want to know.\"\"Want to know what?\"\"What it was like.\"She huffs. \"It was like sex. What else could it be like?\"Even this answer I find hurtful. I had hoped it wouldn't be like sex at all; I had hoped that it would be like something much more boring or unpleasant, instead.\"Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?\"\"What's the difference?\"\"You know the difference.\"\"I never asked you how your extracurricular activities went.\"\"Yes, you did. I remember. 'Have a nice time, dear?'\"\"It was a rhetorical question. Look, we're OK now. We've just had a nice time. Let's leave it at that.\"\"OK, OK. But the nice time we've just had ... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?\"She doesn't say anything.Rob Fleming is not the ideal man you'd want to take a phone call from, hang out with and best of luck if you fell in love with him. But he is a real person and someone I know well. I'd like to think Rob is the sort of non-alcoholic, non-druggie, smart, witty and immature male in his mid-twenties to mid-thirties, \"keeping my options open,\" terrified of commitment and embittered of opportunities that always seem to present themselves to other people, but in reality, his self-obsession occurs across age and even across gender. The chief reason to read the novel is Nick Hornby's exceedingly good taste in records, books and films and his wonderful ear for dialogue (and monologue).But I want to see Clara, Charlie's friend, who's right up my street. I want to see her because I don't know where my street is; I don't even know what part of town it's in, whichcity,whichcountry,so maybe she'll enable me to get my bearings. And it'll be interesting, too, to see what street Charlie thinks I live on, whether it's the Old Kent Road or Park Lane. (Five women who don't live on my street, as far as I know, but would be very welcome if they ever decided to move into my area: the Holly Hunter ofBroadcast News; the Meg Ryan ofSleepless In Seattle; a woman doctor I saw on the telly once, who had lots of long frizzy hair and carved up a Tory MP in a debate about embryos, although I don't know her name and I've never been able to find a pinup of her; Katharine Hepburn inThe Philadelphia Story; Valerie Harper in TV seriesRhoda. These are women who talk back, women with a mind of their own, women with snap and crackle and pop ... but they are also women who seem to need the love of a good man. I could rescue them. I could redeem them. They could make me laugh, and I could make them laugh, maybe, on a good day, and we could stay in and watch one of their films or TV programs or embryo debates on video and adopt disadvantaged children together and the whole family could play soccer in Central Park.)This paragraph is nearly verbatim from my dinner interview with the author.It's my thesis that the majority of authors are married or have been with their current partners for over ten years. I'd add that a lot of authors regardless of status are simply not comfortable with being brutally honest about dating. Nick Hornby is and so isHigh Fidelity, which is honest, tough, funny, sensitive. Adapted to film in 2000, the screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis & Steve Pink & John Cusack relocated the story to Chicago but kept much of Hornby's dialogue intact. Though one of my favorite comedies, the \"romance\" is really between Rob (John Cusack) and Barry (Jack Black), not Rob and Laura (Iben Hjejle). The music and supporting cast (Todd Louiso as Dick,Joan Cusack as Liz, Lisa Bonet as Marie LaSalle, Tim Robbins as Ian, Catherine Zeta-Jones as Charlie, Lili Taylor as Sarah and Bruce Springsteen as himself) are peerless."

        "user_review": "High Fidelityis several things at once.It is a specimen of guylit (I just invented the term yes) - romance and single life explained from the point of view of a man. And we have so few of those.It is a humorous reflection on life and its many failings.And lastly, it is the tale of a Brit singleton in his mid thirties who is unrelentingly firm in his reluctance to grow into a man.A man who is so caught up in his fantasies of the ultimate love one is destined to end up with, that he ignores the woman who truly cares for him and consequently ends up losing her.So the novel begins with our protagonist, Rob Fleming, listing the 5 major break-ups of his life which either hurt him too much or ended up changing him as a person for good. And he takes vicious pleasure in informing the reader that Laura, the woman who just left him, doesn't make the top 5, doesn't even come close.How could you not get sucked into a book which begins on such a promising note?An owner of a dingy vinyl record shop named Championship Vinyl, Rob and his two employee-cum-sidekicks Dick and Barry stumble through the maze of life, more often than not clueless about what they are doing.They debate merits and demerits of obscure bands and music artists and are generous in their display of disdain for the ones who love their Beatles, Billy Joel, Tina Turner, Elton John and the usuals. And these hilarious conversations centering around mundane things like tv shows, movies, music and women lend the plot much of its frivolity and humour. Especially Barry, who is described by Rob as a'snob obscurantist', makes you laugh uncontrollably with his habit of belittling everything, his sneaky tactics of selling records of artists no one has heard of and his interactions with Dick.And so the plot meanders through the zigzagging life of Rob, touches briefly upon the lives of all the women with whom he had been in love at some point of time and settles on his on-and-off relationship with Laura.High Fidelitycomes as close to portraying single life and romance as it actually is and not in the larger-than-life Hollywood rom-comish way. It talks about the things we all do in relationships - how we decide how much to reveal to the other person. How our feelings for a person waver time and again and how we often falter, unable to decide what we want. How we hurt the other person in the process. How we realize how precious a relationship was only after it has ended. And more importantly how we are ever afraid of making that feared transformation - be it from girl to woman or boy to man.Nick Hornby's debut novel is a charming creation - it is like a music record by an artist you may not have heard of but you can relate to the music, nonetheless.And you can't help but want to play the record all over again."

        "user_review": "This is the only Nick Hornby book I've read, and it seemed like a good introduction to the genre I imagine must be called \"dick lit.\" I read it on a plane to the West Coast, and it was the perfect thing: started at take-off, finished just before landing, this had the perfect proportions of light and engaging for 30,000 feet. Ultimately, I found it sort of silly and empty and I had a hard time choosing between two and three stars, but I thought I'd give it a break here, because even though it wasn't funny like B Jones, it was a lot more culturally accessible (I don't remember what kind of music Ms. J liked, but I'll bet it was bad).After all, it's only dick lit, and it served its purpose, which was to preoccupy me while I suffered through the torturous experience of flying in an airplane. I sort of liked the formula, and the idea that the boy version of \"fairytale romance\" isn't meeting Miss Right and riding away together on a handsome stallion, but instead just finally scraping your shit together enough to act a little bit like a grownup in time to avoid permanently alienating the charming girl who's fed up with your tiresome immaturity. Is that the standard male fantasy? Weird."

        "user_review": "Read as part ofThe Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.I used to think-and given the way we ended up, maybe I still do-that all relationships need the kind of violent shove that a crush brings, just to get you started and to push you over the humps. And then, when the energy from that shove has gone and you come to something approaching a halt, you have to look around and see what you've got. It could be something completely different, it could be something roughly the same, but gentler and calmer, or it could be nothing at all.I feel like this book was written as a direct response toBridget Jones's Diary, though I don't know that for sure and I'm too lazy to check the dates. In any case, it is surely a response to all the Chick-Lit that-at the time, and even now-abounds. And at first I was thinking, \"hey, this is justBridget Jones's Diarybut with a Penis\", but it isn't. It isexactly the same.The same whingeing. The same horribleness toward people the protagonists want to have sex with. The same horribleness toward the people the protagonists have had sex with. The horribleness toward the protagonist's so-called friends. The same self-serving ridiculousness and not wanting anyone else to be happy because they're not happy. The same whingeing, the same arrogance, the same patheticness. Maybe you could say thatBridget Jones's Diaryis this but with a Vagina (but then all the whingeing is fine because having stuff coming out of your vagina once a monththat isn't just always bloodis really, super annoying, though I can't recall Bridget ever whingeing about Vagina-blood at all...)Is that the point of these books? To take pathetic people and give them the spotlight because, deep-down, that's all of us? And we never have our voices heard, despite getting drunk every night and shouting our problems out to the night. Are you really like these characters? If you are you should be deeply ashamed and I'm glad you're stuck in a dead-end job and not actually in charge of anything. Stay there, keep your head down, procreate because you don't understand the menstrual cycle or contraception and then die. Please.I can't work out if the protagonist-whatever his name is, I've forgotten already-is supposed to be horrible, pathetic, whingeing, annoying, perverse-in short, a complete cunt-or not: is this the anti-hero kind of thing? Where we like him because, oh, he's a bit not \"normal\" (whatever that is)? Bridget was a cunt, too. I hated them both. Is this what people are actually like? What's wrong with people?This isn't Lad-Lit, or Dick-Lit, or whatever manly spin we have on Chick-Lit this week: it's just Chick-Lit. It hasn't even got a Penis, and Chick-Lit doesn't have a Vagina. It's just people being cunts. With no reference to whatever you think \"cunt\" actually means or the etymology of the word \"cunt\", anglo-saxon or Norse or whatever. Just the metaphorical sense of a person being a cunt. You know what I mean.By the way, I've realised that Love doesn't exist, it's just Fear of being Alone: or it is if you read books like this. I had so many interesting points to make about this book and it was all going to sound like I'd thought long and hard about it, and was making fantastic points and really making you think, and going in to how Love is a construct, and Fear is also a construct so is Love really as unreal as Fear etc but I can't be bothered. I really can't. Why do men have to read this and not readBridget Jones's Diary? It's exactly the same thing.Blog|Reviews|Instagram|Twitter"

        "user_review": "While this wouldn't get near my top five reads this year, it's the best novel I'll ever read featuring top fives. Despite being written only in the mid 90s, it feels a bit dated now in the fact that independent record shops have practically been wiped out. And I don't know how the likes of HMV even manage to survive. The last time I went in a store (this before covid came along) it was almost empty and didn't have that vibe like it used to. Well, that's one thing this novel isn't lacking in, and it isn't just the music but sex and relationships too. In places when it came to the talking of sex, the movie is tame compared to the novel. Bad language too. Someone once said that reading High Fidelity is like listening to a great single where you know it's wonderful from the minute it goes on, and as soon as it's over, you want to hear it again because it makes you feel young, and grown-up, and puts a stupid grin on your face all at the same time. I've no plans to read this again straight away, but it's the sort of book that would absolutely make sense to do so. In Rob, Barry and Dick we have a trio of characters that were great to be in the company of. Together: when Barry can be bothered to get to work on time, they feverishly compile lists of top fives, from Elvis Costello songs, to episodes of Cheers, to bands that will have to be shot come the musical revolution, to name few. But the one that really matters: to Rob anyway, is that all-time, top five most memorable split-ups, brought on by his recent breakup with Laura. Made even worse by the fact she left him for the guy from the upstairs apartment. With record store owner Rob, I doubt I'll come across another character where pop culture seeps into their every sinew, and Hornby captures that lonely feeling of a recent spilt-up, as well as the childishness of adult life with such precision, that I was nodding my head far far more than shaking it. There was such an energy to this that I wish I had read it only in the mornings and not nights, as It was the the literary equivalent to a Red Bull almost. Especially when Barry was on the scene."

        "user_review": "Updated with comments on the Hulu TV show at the end!***November is one of my least favorite months of the year: in Canada, it's cold, humid and gray all the time, there are no stat holidays to give us a breather and everyone is losing their minds in the manic ramp up to the Holidays. That's why I usually spend the month re-reading books that make me happy – I think of it as literary self-care and as an antidote to the crippling seasonal affective disorder that turns me into a raccoon every winter. \"High Fidelity\" has always given me a warm and fuzzy feeling that's just perfect for my book-hygge binge.Part of that is how much I relate to Rob. Well, used to relate, I guess: I was basically a Rob in my twenties. I am a music nerd, and to be honest, a bit of a music snob (I can't control my facial expression at all when someone tells me they've never heard of Joe Strummer, and I once cried because a guy I liked told me he preferred the Perfect Circle cover of \"Gimme Gimme Gimme\" over the Black Flag original…). I am also naturally neurotic, and I used to over-analyse and dissect relationships, conversations and social interactions to death. But worse of all, I used to have this incredibly dumb pattern of falling for a guy's potential instead of for who he was when we met, which, as you can imagine, never ended well. I broke the pattern eventually, but it wasn't always a smooth sail. All that to say that I know Rob as if I had written him myself, and watching him try to figure out how everything could have gone so wrong between him and Laura makes me feel like there is hope for the most awkward of us if we are just willing to work on ourselves a bit.Rob is a record store owner in his mid-thirties, but he's one of those man-child who hasn't matured much since his late teens. He spends his days at the shop with his employees, coming up with all kinds of Top 5 lists and being an absolute elitist jerk to people who aren't as knowledgeable as he is about the Smiths. When his live-in girlfriend Laura leaves him, it plunges his comfortable but lazy life into complete disarray. He decides to try and figure out why he always seems to be getting dumped, and makes a list of his most memorable break ups with the intention to find the women and ask them why they rejected him. We follow him through a very belated coming of age, as he begins to see that he hasn't exactly been a very good boyfriend to anyone in his life, and that the women may not necessarily be the problem…I love Rob's inner monologue, the caustic, self-deprecating but confused and lonely voice of a man who never took the time to understand the women he dated. I also love the way Hornby captures the way music can affect people very deeply: when Rob gets all out of sorts about the Peter Frampton cover, I remembered being moved by similarly ridiculous songs(\"I Caught Fire\" by the Used: you have my permission to laugh at me for ever)because for one reason or another, they hit a very specific nerve at the weirdest time. The scene still made me laugh, but I think I might have also blushed because I have been through that.Mr. Hornby's book is not a literary game-changer, but it's a refreshing look into the neurosis that accompany modern relationships, our perpetual dissatisfaction with others, our selfish need to be happy at the world's expense. Rob is more fun to hang out with than Emma Bovary, but both of them have the same issue of wishing their lives was exactly like their fantasies and they act out when that doesn't happen. Rob, unlike Emma, eventually gets his shit together and one of the things I love most about this book is that it believes in forgiveness and second chances. There is hope and optimism in these pages, and while that might feel naïve at times, it's also lovely. We all fantasize on what life could be, but we must never lose sight of how life really is, because it's often much nicer than any wild fantasy we can come up with, and \"High Fidelity\" is a sweet reminder of that.I really enjoy the movie, even with the Americanization of everything. John Cusack and Jack Black (\"Don't tell anyone you don't own Blonde On Blonde, that's obscene!\", is precisely the sort of obnoxious thing I say) play off each other perfectly and the soundtrack kicks serious ass.***The 2020 Hulu adaptation is absolutely amazing! There are many Easter eggs for fans of the movie, the music is obviously beyond fantastic, and Zoë Kravitz is a perfect Rob! I was afraid of what they would do with the character of Barry, but Da'Vine Joy Randolph truly makes the character of Cherise unique, loveable and scary all at once. Hulu sadly won't be making a second season - which seems to be what happens to really great shows lately, and I think it's a real shame because this was a complete delight. If you like the book and/or the movie, don't hesitate for a minute and watch the series!"

        "user_review": "I watched one of my favorite films, the 2000 Stephen Frears adaptation of Nick Hornby's 1995 book of the same name starring John Cusack. I realized that I had never read the book, so I read it and then watched the movie again.John Cusack BTW is one of my favorite actors and I loved the faithful adaptation of the book's protagonist making top five lists.Top Five John Cusack films:1. High Fidelity2. Say Anything3. Grosse Pointe Blank4. Runaway Jury5. Hot Tub Time MachineHornby's High Fidelity is set in London, the film is set in Chicago, but other than that, the movie remains true to the book. Rob Fleming owns a record store that barely make it by but is patronized by a loyal clientele of music aficionados. Rob's employees, Barry and Dick, join with Rob in music expertise that excludes the normies who only just listen. They make top five lists of everything.Top Five movies set in Chicago:1. Blues Brothers2. Ferris Bueller's Day Off3. The Untouchables4. High Fidelity5. BackdraftRob has a set of neurosis that is funny but also relatable. He's hung up on sex and why girls have broken up with him, brought to the surface by his most recent break up. Laura has left him because she, like everyone, changes but Rob has not. Rob's biggest problem is that he never got over the breakup with Charlie, a girl who was kind of out of his league, mainly because he lacked confidence.Rob's incessant lists, and his reorganization of his extensive record collection is a metaphor for his attempt, often misguided, to organize his own life and for his place amongst those around him.Top Five songs about break ups:1. Ain't No Sunshine – Bill Withers2. Someone Like You – Adele3. I will always love you – Dolly Parton4. Give it Away – George Strait5. If you see her say hello – Bob DylanThe novel follows Rob's awkward, quirky attempts to reconcile his ideas about relationships and love with reality and his fringe element, rock star, outsider looking in rejection of mainstream society. Hornby demonstrates his great ability by describing scenes that we can all understand and with much humor.Ultimately this is about love, relationships and the redemptive qualities of music. Great book."

I happen to love music just as much as Rob in the book and I'm much worse when it comes to my books, but you know what? It's freaking charming. I love it.Just the way I loved the movie before I knew it was based on this book, I loved it. It was super charming and embarrassing and appropriate and pathetic and downright glorious. All at once.And I'm a fan. Still am, now that I've read the book. And my only complaint? I need that soundtrack running in the background... OH WAIT! I HAVE SPOTIFY! :) Tee hee!"

What more could I say about him ? Well, Rob is thirty-five selfish asshole, pompous snob and a pathetic, emotionally immature loser. But I still like him .And who is immature now, huh ?Do not worry, I will not treat you now with a tearful story about my ex, though I will tell you about a guy who, if I ever had compiled, in imitation of Rob, list of the most memorable and painful partings in my life, would have taken not only the first place. Actually he would take the whole podium. Piotr, do not let him remain nameless, after all the winner takes it all, so, Piotr was nice and sensitive guy, somehow wonderfully shy and helpless. He was a guy because of whom when we split-upI lost the plot for a while then. And I lost the subplot, the script, the soundtrack, the intermission, my popcorn the credits, and the exit sign.Well, he was a selfish asshole and pathetic loser.Who said that? Oh, shut up ! My older and more cynical self, I'm not in the mood to listen to you today.We were wandering around the streets, by whole hours listening to the music, discussing books . Nothing special.And Heaven knows I'm miserably now in my life ...I do not remember if Piotr loved The Smiths, certainly we listened to The Clash, jazz, a bit of blues. Piotr run a record store but nowadays works on the radio, sometimes I come across on his programme and ... it's always nice to hear his voice. Oddly enough, I never thought then he had a radio voice. And really he had .But let's get back to Rob. Hornby created a bitter - sweet, ironic portrait of lonely and scared man. Rob is a guy with simple solution for everything, with justification for any situation. He is like a kid who believes that life is a movie in which all the others play supporting roles. But because life is neither pop charts nor listeners choice you seldom get what you think you deserve .Hornby's observations are accurate and witty, spiced with wry humour, and even when Rob feels miserable and has a hard time - this is not any existential drama. And when he finally states that even people with, in his opinion, trashy collection of records, are ok, there is a hope for him yet."

It is in the making as a series with the gender of the lead flipped - interesting!This was an okay read for me, I feel my lack of music knowledge may have not made it a winner for me. Meandering young guy, not knowing what he wants out of life it seemed to me, but he wanted a girl that's for sure. Funny hearing the angsty teenage relationship uncertainty and sexual frustration from a guys point of view as it's usually flipped in the contemporary reads I come across.In general, the meandering feeling dragged this out for me and I wasn't fussed. Also, choosing the audio version may not have been the wisest choice, I lost interest quite easily.A modern classic, but not for me. I'm probably just too boring, and not the target audience!"

Something I did regularly in my youth, a great book commencer indeed!!!Turns out that taking the opportunity — at 230am the other night — as I scrounged through old many-multiple-home-relocations — was a smart one. For I located my copy of this classic the-one-that-got-away trope (wait, or is it more.. the classic I-hate-her-I-hate-her-I-miss-her-I-despise-her-I-love-her trope?) and I have to say it outshined even my most optimistic Nostalgic expectations.Picturing A forlorn Cusack undoubtedly aided the process, but longing-for-Laura is such an enchanting train-wreck that is expertly written in a prose that's befitting of the arc in a way that is hard to enunciate for some reason.So many (literal) laugh-out-loud set pieces, an incredibly funny narrator and that magical combination with captivating images and moving passages that partner together to make those majestic-like pages!Towards the final pages, it did begin to grind away a little slowly and feel a little 'whiny' but overall, the movie was a 4 star, The Novel is closer to a 4.50 Star.."

        "user_review": "In times of stress people resort to different coping mechanisms – some do yoga, some do wine, some smoke cigarettes …Rob Fleming, 36, recently separated from his girlfriend and in the midst of some sort of mid-thirties crisis, reorganises his vinyl records collection. While this might usually restore his equilibrium, this time, his crisis is just too big; and he is instead, led to reorganise all his ex-girlfriends. Hence the reader is drawn into an obsessive evaluation of Rob's previous relationships, and this makes for a very funny and emotionally interesting journey!Rob is thorough, he starts right at the beginning, his first love interest when he was twelve that lasted about three hours – he was shattered. One never fully recovers from that first burn, eh? He moves on, methodically analysing other failed relationships, picking them apart, diagnosing the effects of how he got to where he miserably is. What does he discover? Well, that he is a commit – a – phobe for one thing! A common ailment amongst men. And while he is not alone, his escapism and methods of dealing with his fear of hunkering down with a girl for the long haul – through the good and the bad, seem unusual! \"Is it so wrong, wanting to be at home with your record collection? It's not like collecting records is like collecting stamps, or beermats, or antique thimbles. There's a whole world in here, a nicer, dirtier, more violent, more peaceful, more colourful, sleazier, more dangerous, more loving world than the world I live in; there is history, and geography, and poetry, and countless other things I should have studied at school, including music.\"This is a very funny novel. I haven't seen the movie version, but I imagine John Cusack did a brilliant job. As a character, Rob is both infuriating and endearing. We appreciate his will for self reflection and unashamed honesty if nothing else….\"Me, I'm unmarried – at the moment as unmarried as it's possible to be – and I'm the owner of a failing record shop. It seems to me that if you place music (and books, probably, and films, and plays, and anything that makes you feel) at the centre of your being, then you can't afford to sort out your love life, start to think of it as the finished product. You've got to pick at it, keep it alive and in turmoil, you've got to pick at it and unravel it until it all comes apart and you're compelled to start all over again. Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship. Maybe Al Green is directly responsible for more than I ever realized….\"He can be precocious and self-indulgent, at the same time lacking confidence and conviction. A memorable example is the dinner party scene: \"I sit there like a pudding, feeling like a child who's been allowed to stay up late for a special treat. We eat stuff I don't know about, and either Nick or Barney comments on each bottle of wine we drink apart from the one I brought…\"Rob is also what I refer to as a \"wobbler\" (yeah, you know who you are!) I can't stand wobblers (I know I'm sorry, I'm just one of those not on the fence, decisive people!!!) Stand up straight and make a decision, please! Which, ultimately Rob does when he finally realises that it is futile to \"fear fear\" – if we live in chronic hesitation to step one way or the other, we never move forward and we also risk missing out on life changing opportunities – so he stops \"wobbling,\" feels the fear and 'grows up!'Hornby's writing, and capacity for witty and quirky dialogue is exceptional. He is highly original. I can imagine this novel in the hands of many other authors could have resulted in an uncomfortable literary mess. Written more than two decades ago, and couched very much in 90s popular culture, this novel still rings true today. We might not be listening to as much Simply Red (thank god!!!) or wearing denim with denim (unforgivable) and worrying about the Y2K bug (yes, it was a real fear), but we are still fumbling through relationships, hooking up and then breaking up, getting hangovers and having one night stands, enjoying live music (at least we were before corona virus, now we live stream instead), regretting and reflecting, loving and losing. And hey, thanks to hipsters we're also spinning more vinyl records now than ever before!"

        "user_review": "Remember all those Romantic films or even the hapless Romantic Comedies you've seen, the infinitesimal, clichéd and hopelessly repetitive plots? The same guy and gal meet somewhere odd or mildly weird so that things are interesting. Probably a boss and employee type of thing (The Proposal? Go to hell, Ryan Reynolds, you big-mouthed wanker!) Or two people from very far places brought together by kismet or something as appallingly believable (Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail, Philadelphia? Wait, Philadelphia's about AIDS so it's has to be mentioned. I've got nothing bad to say about Tom Hanks. I used to love you, Meg Ryan.) Or they're sex friends, friends with benefits, all that modern freedom excuse (Friends With Benefits? No Strings Attached?) Or someone very rich and famous going for someone scrapping-by and morally compromised (Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan? No, Maid in Manhattan is pure rubbish. Pretty Woman is the lovable shit. I'd pick Richard Gere over Ralph Fiennes and Julia Roberts over Jennifer Lopez any day. Plus, there's something more righteous and morally redemptive about loving a hooker than a maid. You know, I don't really get why the men are always the rich guys going for the hookers and stuff. Is this a sexist thing? Is it? Probably it's more of men's domination. You know, wanting submissive women and stuff. Now we're getting in murky waters. Don't dare get excited, you feminist! This might be the insane reason why women love The Notebook. Cause, you know, the rich girl is settling for the poor lad, instead of the usual other way around.) Alright, enough examples, you get the drift. So there its exciting cause stuff's pretty complicated. They meet up, become friends or something because of a certain unfathomable thing happening. Then before long, what-da-ya-know, they fall in love. They don't care bout nothing but sex, and spending time with each other and stuff, the crazy, bat-shit, rick-rolling, fucked-up shit kinda love. Then as sure as the sun will set, something wrong happens, there's a problem or trouble and you know the drill. They go separate ways, but somewhere along the line the guy realizes that he loves the gal. And so, it's the its-amazing-how-writers-are-able-to-think-of-some-new-way-to-propose scene. Always lots of people, always making a big fuss, always saying something like: I'm an idiot because I let you go. (You are an idiotic writer, you slob.) The variances are probably minor details like: asking for marriage (insanely a sure bet), holding a stereo while saying it, change it to flowers, or probably make it rain to be more dramatic, or changing the stupid catch-phrase. So then the girl begins to cry and then they kiss and the end. Fuck you, movies! I mean, we all know they're shit and they're outrageously predictable. That they're as cyclic as women's cycles, but by Jove, we still watch the shit and feel all gooey and mushy inside. When we come out of that theater we all end up thinking: Someday I'm gonna meet someone and fall in luv. Well, too bad.You know, these movies are largely responsible for us blokes getting the wrong idea about relationships. Sure, music's done its bit, but movies are more demonstrative. Take me for example, I'm a wanker. I own up to it because I am. I go out with women and find fault with them, always happens with me. I'm like: she's not smart enough or her hands are freakishly small, or she looks anemic. I was even once turned off by a girl because \"her fingernails look weird\". These are real reasons why I copped-out on someone. I get it I'm an asshole. I'm pretty sure that I can pin it on something the movies led me to believe: perfect love. I'm hell bent on keeping my options open, I never settle for anyone cause someone perfect or better might come and I don't want to be unavailable when that happens. Sure, I flirt and do the motions. But I'm pretty… not scared, more like stressed by the commitment. Ms. Perfect might walk through that door, and I won't let (name of the very nice girl I'm out with) get in the way. When I read this book, the portrayal by Nick Hornby was so disturbingly familiar that I actually felt déjà vu on various occasions. Okay, I'm not as daft as that Rob Fleming bloke, but I'm pretty much made of the same worries. I totally get the part where Rob says he cheated on Laura because she might die. Some men do things for preemptive measures. Guys can break up with girls just because they think the girl might break up with them. And being the dumper is so much better than being the dumpee, so they do it just in case. Stupid, huh? But it really happens. Another thing is attainable women losing glamour. Say, you see a gal you like; you're really into her and stuff. When she's impossible to attain she's more attractive. When you find out that maybe she likes you back, maybe she's interested. My reaction would be to feel less attracted to her. I dunno why, but that's true, in my case. And well, in Fleming's case, when he finds out that Laura wanted him back, he immediately evolves from being depressed to moving on and finding some else, Ms. Perfect. I'm not saying all guys are the same. We're all different, but there are also lots of similarities. We all are bound by certain tendencies like most women have certain similarities as well. I'm telling you, you wanna figure out the closest thing going through your man's head then read this book.Okay, maybe not all men are as suffocated by these tendencies. You know FRIENDS? There's a character there named Ross, Ross loves to get married. There are Ross kinda guys. These are the types of guys born for relationships. They're not scared at all by commitment and feel right at home in bondage. I'm not one of those. I have a friend like this, loves getting into long relationships and is always feeling very happy about it. Like Phil, who meets Jackie and then they break up cause of Rob then back together again to start a family. Like Ross, who gets married 3 times and gets divorced by each one yet still walks along the path of the holy matrimony. Maybe these are the kinds of guys women want; I think they're pretty rare. I think they're really weird. Then there are the Joey kinda guys, the players, scared stiff by commitment and marriage and love. Just guys looking for sex and fun, hopping from one bed to another, never finding that woman they wanna be with permanently. Why? Cause they don't even want one. Permanence is like poison to these guys. Then we have the, badum-tss, the Chandlers. These guys start out like Joey, scared by commitment and all that crap. But along the way, they either trip and wake up or they meet a Monica, a game changer. I don't think they're changed from Joey to Ross overnight. No, Chandler was still very jumpy and scared when he was with Monica, but he worked for it and understood that there are things you sacrifice if you want an adult relationship to work. Shit! What am I saying? Take these things with a grain of salt, cause I don't really know what I'm doing. But you know what? I always figured Chandler to be the loser among the guys. Now, I know different. Cause Ross was a natural, he was born to wed, Joey's gonna end up an old man living on a shack by himself, and Chandler was the only guy who really worked for the relationship he had. Bloody Hell, I hope to be a Chandler some day, cause I know I ain't a Ross, and Joey's a pretty grim option.Alright, I confess, I'm only 19 years old. So what? So you say I shouldn't waste my time on love and relationships and the likes. I agree, I should focus more on my studies. But you know, it's like a fad, romance is the thing that makes people feel jumpy-joyous and top-of-the-world happy. I know, it's also responsible for massive amounts of suicides and murders. But, bloody hell, it's the thing that makes us feel human. Also, I can't seem to shake girls out of my head. Humans are pretty pathetic creatures, huh? It's like this love or romance thingy is our gasoline and without it we can't go anywhere in our lives. So if this is gonna adversely affect my future, how can you expect me not to worry about it? I gotta practice you know. So that when the time comes, I'll do it right. Plus, I have other reasons. Heh heh. Oh, what a bunch of bollocks!I must seem pretty well about, huh? Sure, I read and review lots of complicated books and stuff. Sure I go to one of top universities in my country. Sure, I've watched hundreds of romantic movies. Plus, I recycle. But that doesn't mean shit about knowing anything about this love and relationship thing. I'm as stupid as a guy somewhere wearing a Guns n' Roses t-shirt, sporting a Mohawk, coked out of his mind. Thankfully, I read this book. Here's what my shackled guy's brain managed to pick up: It's never going to be as perfect as I imagined it to be, yet somehow it will work, if you make it work.You ever heard the saying: \"You don't love someone because they're perfect; you love them despite their imperfections.\"? Well, I guess that needs a little elaboration. I guess you love them less because of their imperfections, but at the end of the day, you love them still.Well, that was me giving my sophomoric thoughts about love and relationships and High Fidelity. What can I say? Nice try. Close, but no cigar. See you around."

He also feels entitled to determine what Good Music™ is, and he enjoys making fun of people with different taste with his two pals (no wonder why his music shop is not doing well). Oh, and let's not forget that gratuitous biphobic comment in which he basically implies bisexual people are perverts that can give you STDs and compares them to drug-addicts.

Someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"hey, there's a VIP coming in, put on your bellboy hat and head out front.\" I didn't put on my bellboy hat because I didn't have one — just the same dirty, drenched apron I wore every day in that year or two between high school and college, at least whenever I wasn't sitting in my shitty little apartment, or else wasting time and brain cells someplace else.Stepping out into the sub-zero winds, I saw before me the grandest tour bus I'd ever seen in my whole entire life.

It was required reading for a University course I took on Adolescent Literature.This book has been placed on banned book lists by needlessly close-minded people for it's real life content.The book tastefully addresses issues of molestation, rape, racism. But it does so within the context of the trials and tribulations of growing up as well.The book presents things in a direct and extremely vivid fashion, but it is not garishly or needlessly graphic. These are issues that need to be addressed and talked about with adolescents. In fact, earlier generations could have likely benefited from a little more open discussion about such matters.In any regard, the book is not about these issues, it simply addresses them within the context, which is Maya Angelou's early life from somewhere around age 6 up to about 17 or 18 I believe.Worth reading, worth having your kids read. Just be sure to discuss it's content with them......like a parent should anyway."

        "user_review": "Maya Angelou was a poet and Nobel laureate who once gave an address at President Clinton's inauguration. Before she won her multitudes of awards and honors, Maya was raised in rural Stamps, Arkansas by her grandmother and uncle during the depression. First published in 1969 and now considered a modern classic, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings details Angelou's tumultuous childhood in poignant detail.Born Marguerite Johnson and often called Ritie, Maya and her older brother Bailey were taken to live with their grandmother at young ages following their parents' divorce. Even though the south was still in the throes of Jim Crow and Stamps was at the forefront of segregation, young Maya appeared to enjoy a loving childhood. Raised by a strict, church going grandmother and uncle, Maya and Bailey turned to both books and each other for comfort. Devouring books like candy, both children quickly advanced through the Stamps educational system, two grades ahead of schedule.When Maya was eight and Bailey nine, their father came to Arkansas and brought them to live with their mother in St Louis. Coming from a multi racial family, members of Maya's maternal family were light skinned enough to pass for white and some integrated into the German community. It was in St Louis, a city that should have afforded Maya more opportunities than rural Stamps, that she experienced the low point in her childhood. Physically abused by her mother's fiancé, Maya recovered and returned to Stamps and a loving environment. She and Bailey continued to live with their grandmother until they had advanced beyond what the education system offered them in the segregated south. With no future other than a house servant or cotton picker, the two were returned to their mother, now living in desegregated California.While in California, Maya experienced highs and lows as well as Jim Crow rearing its ugly head, the low point of which was living in a car in a junk yard for a month. These experiences, including being reunited with both parents and establishing relationships with them, made for events that Maya could reflect on later on in life in this volume. I find it extraordinary that Maya could overcome being abused as a young child and still manage to graduate school two years ahead of schedule at a high academic level. This is a testament to her grandmother as well as her personal fabric. This fabric lead her to be the first colored streetcar operator in San Francisco and later on the poet laureate that people recognize to this day.Maya Angelou noted her writing influences as Langston Hughes, Paul Laurence Dunbar, as well as Booker T Washington who encouraged a generation of African Americans to achieve employment through a stellar education. In her dedication, Angelou also cites her parents as being positive influences in her life after they reconciled. A gifted author and poet who was advanced well beyond her years as a child, Maya graced us with her powerful prose in all of her works of literature. A poignant look into a childhood in the Jim Crow, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings reveals the upbringing of a remarkable American woman. A courageous glimpse into Angelou's life, this first memoir of hers easily merits 5 bright stars."

        "user_review": "I have only ever given 5 stars to two autobiographies. One was written by a white English man; the other by a black American woman. On the surface you would think they could have very little in common, yet they do. They both have insight and compassion, which comes through in every sentence. They have both shown enormous courage in almost intolerable situations. In short, they have a common humanity. The white man is Terry Waite. The black woman, Maya Angelou.I Know Why the Caged Bird Singsby Maya Angelou is a book which will play on your emotions. It is not a manipulative book; it is a raw and honest account, eloquently expressed. But if you did not take a deep breath sometimes before starting another page, you would not be human.It is galling to think that this description of poverty and unreasoning prejudice is within living memory, in a so-called \"free\" country. In the United States, the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity was set up in 1961, prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It precedes the Race Relations Act of 1965, which was the first legislation in the United Kingdom to address racial discrimination. Yet the differences of perception and attitudes between the two countries for the early and middle parts of the 20th Century are enormous.Perhaps it is the sheer size of the US, but the racial segregation which was ever-present - at least in the Southern States - was never a feature of English life, or life in Great Britain. There was prejudice certainly, and when there was an influx of black people in the 1960's to fulfil specific job vacancies, such as nursing or bus drivers and conductors, some black people suffered much abuse and humiliation from some members of the indigenous white public, such as landladies putting cards saying \"no coloureds\" in their windows. But the discrimination was never institutionalised. Unlike South Africa and the Southern States of America, there were no separate schools, townships or public toilets. The UK was not a racist society as such, although some individual members of it certainly were.What comes across in this book, especially to a non-American, is that the racial segregation was condoned. It was the norm at all points. It seems so entrenched that it is startling that any progress could be made from such a point. For this appalling account of ignorance and prejudice is surprisingly recent. Maya Angelou was born in 1928, and was therefore slightly younger than my own mother. And she was describing events which were closer in time to when she was writing them, than we now are ahead in time. It ends in 1944, before the end of World War II. This is the first part of her autobiography, which finally ran to seven volumes, the final volume being published in 2013.I knew of Maya Angelou's works of course, but somehow had never got around to reading them.I Know Why the Caged Bird Singshad been sitting on my bookshelf for 20 years unread. Perhaps part of me suspected it would be a harrowing read, but I had not anticipated its wry humour. Maya Angelou died last year, in 2014. There's a sort of poignancy in discovering a writer after they have just died. Sometimes it happens because for a short time they achieve more prominence generally. When the reaction is so positive, the experience is tinged with slight regret, nonsensical though it is. For so many long-dead classic authors that opportunity is not open to us from the start. It would have been nice to appreciate them more during their lifetime. Will I carry on reading the continuing parts? Certainly. The five stars are not awarded solely to the person. They are awarded to the work, as they should be. It is an extraordinary first book, especially considering that the author is someone who feels the voice is essential for meaning, someone who was always recognised as a passionate performance poet. From this book alone,\"Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with shades of deeper meaning.\"Here is her memory of an inspired natural teacher, Sister Flowers,\"I had read a Tale of Two Cities and found it up to my standards as a romantic novel. She opened the first page and I heard poetry for the first time in my life ... her voice slid in and curved down through and over the words. She was nearly singing.\"\"As I ate she began the first of what we later called \"my lessons in living.\" She said that I must always be intolerant of ignorance but understanding of illiteracy. That some people, unable to go to school, were more educated and even more intelligent than college professors. She encouraged me to listen carefully to what country people called mother wit. That in those homely sayings was couched the collective wisdom of generations ... I wanted to look at the pages. Were they the same that I had read? Or were there notes, music, lined on pages\"Perhaps then it is not so surprising to find a poetic turn of phrase, such lyrical prose as,\"in the dying sunlight the people dragged rather than their empty sacks\"or a beautifully evocative description. But be warned. Not everything which is graphic here is beautiful imagery,\"I remember the sense of fear which filled my mouth with hot, dry air, and made my body light\"\"If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat.It is an unnecessary insult.\"The blurb itself, should you read it, will tell the reader of some very disturbing events which are described, but those parts will prompt a deep emotional reaction. The work also puts much of her poetry in context; the anger and prominent themes in her poetry become all of a piece with the unfolding account of her life. And in this, the staggered telling of her tale is also very effective. She alternated a book of poetry with a book of autobiography, and these memoirs are far more expressive and revealing than one static book of past autobiography could be. The gradual telling of her tale feels more in the present, than it does reflection.The first volume starts with the author, then called\"Marguerite Johnson\"at 3 years old, being sent on a train journey with her 4 year old brother. Neither had any idea why they were being sent South to live with their grandmother,\"Momma\"in the tiny town of \"Stamps\", Arkansas. Most of this first part is about her life there; her strict upbringing by the poor, but proud and upright, religious woman, who devoted herself to making as good a life as she could for her disabled son and grandchildren,\"I was liked, and what a difference it made.\"The store served the needs of all those in Stamps, mostly workers in the cotton fields. The recent history of slavery is virtually palpable. The conditions at times seemed little better than the past. Each day the workers started with optimism, but they were trapped in a life from which realistically they could never escape; never being paid enough for their work to get out of debt. Yet nearly all these people were hard-working and honest,\"Although there was always generosity in the Negro neighborhood, it was indulged on pain of sacrifice. Whatever was given by Black people to other Blacks was most probably needed as desperately by the donor as by the receiver. A fact which made the giving or receiving a rich exchange.\"There are wonderful descriptions of her grandmother's store. It is a hub for the community, a working business, but for young Marguerite it is a cornucopia of smells and sights,\"the store was my favorite place to be. Alone and empty in the mornings, it looked like an unopened present from a stranger\"She remembers the days here, the pride of her handicapped Uncle Willy, the immensely strict regime she and her brother Bailey Junior were expected to cope with. Her grandmother, a businesswoman, was much respected in the exclusively black area of Stamps,\"I remember never believing that whites were really real ... These others, the strong pale creatures that lived in their alien unlife, weren't considered folks. They were white-folks.\"\"People in Stamps used to say that the whites in our town were so prejudiced that a Negro couldn't buy vanilla ice cream\"She escaped whenever possible into her fantasy world of books,\"I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare. He was my first white love ... 'When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes.' It was a state with which I felt myself most familiar\"\"Because I was really white and because a cruel fairy stepmother, who was understandably jealous of my beauty, had turned me into a too-big Negro girl, with nappy black hair, broad feet and a space between her teeth that would hold a number-two pencil.\"As the author grew older, her perception of bigotry, her indignation at the racial unfairness which pervaded everything in her experience, grew. She accepted without understanding the submissive attitudes she was expected to make, and subservience she had to show, observing of Momma,\"She didn't cotton to the idea that white folks could be talked to at all without risking one's life. And certainly they couldn't be spoken to insolently\"But her grandmother wanted the best for the two children,\"I swear to God, I rather you have a good mind than a cute behind.\"There is much about loneliness and alienation in this first novel. Maya Angelou tried to cultivate a philosophical attitude to her experiences,\"Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between\"\"Like most children, I thought if I could face the worst danger voluntarily, and triumph, I would forever have power over it\"But the instances piled one on top of another. Even the wild, neglected and dirty\"powhitetrash\"children jeered, made fun of, and looked down on all the people in the the black neighbourhood. A doctor, a dentist - people who should have been literally indebted to her grandmother because of the financial help she had afforded them in the past - showed truly shocking insulting behaviour when appealed to for help. The white people almost exclusively treated the black people worse than they would treat their animals. It is difficult to convey without telling the story how each tiny instance was compounded. During a court case,\"The judge had really made a gaffe calling a Negro woman 'Mrs'\"because, of course, a white person's perception was that a black person did not deserve the status of respect.The book seems to escalate until the reader feels that something has to give.The author reflects that it was perhaps one instance of profound prejudice, which severely affected her brother emotionally, which led to their being sent away from Arkansas. They had only lived there a couple of years, when the two children were collected by their father, a cultured giant of a man, and taken back to live with their mother -\"Mother Dear\"as Bailey called her - in St. Louis. Their lives from this point take a sudden turn, living with this impulsive beautiful butterfly of a woman with her film-star looks. A crime is committed when Maya is just eight years old. This is brutal; an appalling account to read, both a physically and psychologically raw and graphic description. The child is the victim, but as so often happens, the victim is convinced that she is somehow guilty. Circumstances force her to tell a small lie, and for this too, she cannot forgive herself. The children return to Momma.The next few years are chronicled in the book with much movement between the adults in the family. They have to cope with extremes in moral codes. From the earliest chapters the reader has been stunned by the extremist Christian doctrine of their grandmother. Beating a child for saying\"by the way\", because - never mind whether the child understands or not - it was considered to be blasphemy. Another small incident which haunts the reader, is Bailey Junior being beaten for yearning so much for his mum, that he watched a similar-looking film star, and was late home. There are countless such examples. These are very hard to accept, because these two things were perpetrated by the good people - the ones with a sense of duty and responsibility. The ignorant prejudice in the wider community, outside the town of Stamps, was oddly easier to read about than this, which felt like a betrayal by the adults whom the children trusted.But later, the moral code is turned on its head. Both Maya's mother and father were city folk working in a very different world. Her father in Mexico had friends who were almost gangsters, with a completely different sense of morality, although in itself the ethical code was just as strong,\"The needs of a society determine its ethics\".These parts are very entertaining to read, and must have been an eye-opener to a young teenager from such a narrow background.The book ends when Maya Angelou is 17. Although her given name was\"Marguerite\", she was always called\"Maya\"because her brother called her\"My-a\",trying to say the words\"my sister\". To the little girl, that felt like her true identity, not what others called her. There is one episode in the book, where a white woman tried to call her\"Mary\"for her own personal convenience -\"because it was shorter\". That is a hugely emotional part of the book. The reader can sense the profound insult; the hidden history of \"ownership\". I gave a mental cheer when Maya managed to turn this around.At 12 Maya had had her graduation from Lafayette County Training School. I personally found this almost the most affecting part of the book. Maya was a supremely talented and hard-working child. The reader senses her feelings bubbling over - her well-earned pride in her achievements. But yet again, because of an incident involving an ignorant white person, her whole world comes crashing down around her ears,\"Graduation, the hush-hush magic time of frills and gifts and congratulations and diplomas, was finished for me before my name was called. The accomplishment was nothing. The meticulous maps, drawn in three colors of ink, learning and spelling decasyllabic words, memorizing the whole of The Rape of Lucrece - it was for nothing. Donleavy had exposed us. We were maids and farmers, handymen and washerwomen, and anything higher that we aspired to was farcical and presumptuous.\"Maya Angelou had somehow recovered from the terrible crime against her at 8 years old. How could she possibly recover from this one? How can one person continue to have courage, strength and fight? Isn't it easier just to give up and say, \"Yes Ma'am\"?\"The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time. She is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.\"This is a book that will sometimes make you ashamed to be a member of the human race. It is in part a catalogue of Man's inhumanity to man, woman's inhumanity to woman. It will also, however, make you proud of what can be achieved. One hopes it was cathartic to write, but it is far more than the plague of misery sagas which have descended onto our bookshelves in recent years. It is nonfiction, but it is as entertaining as a novel; parts of it reading like lyrical prose. It has some devastating descriptions of brutality, yes, but there is much to smile over too, often in her wry little asides,\"The custom of letting obedient children be seen but not heard was so agreeable to me that I went one step further: Obedient children should not see or hear if they chose not to do so\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Singsis an important, defining, incredibly brave work for its time of 1969. From a relatively unknown author, a world was firmly introduced to the reality of racial tensions and prejudice in the Southern United States. It was a book which would have been very hard to read without the author's strength and humour coming through, and it remains so, over 45 years later.The book grips you from its start. Maya Angelou has a unique ability to make any reader identify with a poor black child, to experience what they experience, from whatever point the reader is in their own life. There is much talk nowadays of the \"Black Voice\". Maya Angelou does not alienate. She does not seek to select her audience; she speaks to us all. Her book is self-evidently from a black perspective, but she skilfully makes it the reader's own, putting us all firmly in the mind of herself as a child. She conveys her various feelings of confusion, pride, hatred, despair, guilt and rage, expressing so well the reasoning behind them at the time.Her use of dialect is perfectly balanced for a general reader. It is authentic and essential, yet at no point is the reader likely to have to pause, reread and try to interpret. I personally have had far more difficulty with my experience of classic books which attempt to include a written representation of my own native, regional Yorkshire speech. This is part of her great skill as a writer - it flows. She concentrates on our common humanity. This is a book which can, perhaps should, be read by everyone at least once in their lifetime. It shows how far both an individual and a society can progress within one person's lifetime.\"The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste and even belligerence. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors and deserves respect if not enthusiastic admiration.\"As tiny Marguerite Johnson might have said - although she would have \"corrected\" her own grammar, as all people have different vernaculars for different situations, and black people of that time had one \"language\" for school and academic pursuits, another for their community, and a third to reinforce white people's expectations of them ...\"We all doin' well.\"\"It was awful to be Negro and have no control over my life. It was brutal to be young and already trained to sit quietly and listen to charges brought against my color with no chance of defense. We should all be dead. I thought I should like to see us all dead, one on top of the other. A pyramid of flesh with the whitefolks on the bottom, as the broad base, then the Indians with their silly tomahawks and teepees and wigwams and treaties, the Negroes with their mops and recipes and cotton sacks and spirituals sticking out of their mouths. The Dutch children should all stumble in their wooden shoes and break their necks. The French should choke to death on the Louisiana Purchase, while silkworms ate all the Chinese with their stupid pigtails. As a species, we were an abomination. All of us.\"I Know Why The Caged Bird SingsThe free bird leapson the back of the windand floats downstreamtill the current endsand dips his wingsin the orange sun raysand dares to claim the sky.But a bird that stalksdown his narrow cagecan seldom see throughhis bars of ragehis wings are clipped andhis feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing.The caged bird singswith fearful trillof the things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hill for the caged birdsings of freedom"

I imagine that Maya's book has allowed countless women who have suffered similar horrors an opportunity to know they will never be alone in their pain. And perhaps, like my mother, an opportunity to begin to heal by sharing their story with a loved one.RIP, Maya. Your words have made this planet a better place.

Because the only thing the caged bird can do is sing, he will keep on doing it, lest he go mad. Poetry will keep on flowing out of the decapitated head of Orpheus.I understand that this book has been banned multiple times. Not surprising, considering that the words of the poet have more power than swords or bullets, as proved time and again by history.----------------------------------------------------------Maya Angelou (born Marguerite Johnson) and her brother Bailey were sent to live with their paternal grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas when their parents' marriage fell apart. It was the early thirties, and the North and the South of USA were poles apart as far as coloured people were concerned; in the North, they were part of the society (albeit an insular one) while in the South, they were the despised 'niggers'.Maya spent most of the formative part of her childhood down south. Her grandmother ('Momma') was a singularly resourceful woman who owned a store: they managed to live in relative comfort even during the Depression era. However, this material comfort was offset by the fact that they were always the hated 'other' - the 'whitefolk' who lived apart (almost a mythical race, in Maya's young mind) were powerful and whimsical gods who could visit death and destruction any time on any black man or woman. Even the 'powhitetrash', the drifters and squatters who had the fortune to be born into the Anglo-Saxon race, could insult even the propertied black people with impunity.When she was eight years old, Maya's father took her brother and herself to their mother, Vivian Baxter, in St. Louis. Here the incident which was to become the turning point of her life happened. The eight-year old girl was raped by her mother's current boyfriend, Mr. Freeman: he managed to wiggle out of jail only to be murdered, presumably by Maya's maternal uncles who were also the town toughs. As a result of this, she became a virtual mute for almost five years.Sent back to Stamps, Maya continued her zombie-like existence until she was brought back into the world of the living by Bertha Flowers, a teacher and family friend - she did this by the expedient of introducing the girl to books. Maya found refuge in the world of imagination, and slowly came back to normal.She again went to live with her mother in California when she was 15. During this sojourn, she visited her father in Southern California where another traumatic even in her life took place. After a frightening journey across the border into Mexico along with her father (when she was forced to drive a car back to the US in the night with him passed out in the back – even though she was not a qualified driver!), Maya was attacked and stabbed by her father's girlfriend. She quit home and lived for a month in a junkyard, with similar social drop-outs, before returning to her mother.A month of living in the rough had emboldened the shy and withdrawn girl. Maya decided to get a job as a streetcar conductor, even though the occupation was closed to blacks, and succeeded: the activist and rebel were just emerging. The first instalment of this extended autobiography ends with the picture of Maya as a teen mother, of a child conceived out of a casual sexual encounter which she had just to satisfy that she was 'normal' (that is, heterosexual)!----------------------------------------------------------Maya writes with a disarming honesty and a genuine sense of humour. Even the most distressing events are discussed casually – the child's eye view is done really well. The book is eminently readable. Still, is this a great book? I would not say so. Good, yes: genuinely great, no.The causal tone, for me, took away most of the poignancy. Even the extremely distressing rape incident – though described in gory detail – fails to really make an impact. My personal feeling is that this is the author's way of coping with personal trauma: you take the emotion out of it. However, it might come across to people that her mother never cared much (I have found this view expressed on one or two of the one-star reviews for this book on this site).However, I salute Maya's courage in writing this explicit memoir. Being a black woman, she feels disadvantaged thrice, as she says:The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.So maybe, the best defence is to attack. Throw the hypocrisy of society back in its face. Say: \"This is I. Accept me for what I am, whether you like what you see or not!\""

        "user_review": "Even before I started listening to this audio book, I could hear Angelou's voice, deep and distinctive. I remember seeing her on tv at some point in the past and notably, even though a while ago, when she read a poem she had written for President Clinton's inauguration. This autobiography of her early years from age four through sixteen makes for a tough story at times, but an amazing telling of it. At four years old, she and her brother Bailey are sent to Stamps, Arkansas to live with their paternal grandmother, a staunchly religious and savvy store owner and their disabled Uncle Willy. They help at the store , go to school and live through times of ugly racism. Four years later they go to live with their mother and at eight years old Maya is raped by her mother's boyfriend. The children return to live with their grandmother, but Maya is so scarred by the attack that she stops speaking for several years.Yet, amid the bad times in this depiction of the Jim Crow south, there are times of happiness and revelation of what life has to offer. It is back in Stamps that she develops a love of reading and she calls Shakespeare her first white love. She shares the joy of making her first friend and her unconditional love for her brother Bailey. The descriptions of the revival meeting and the church picnic and the days at her grandmother's store are poetic and she took me there with her wonderful story telling. A few years later, they move back with their mother and it is here in California that we see the impact of the past on her and also see her come of age at sixteen, on her journey to becoming the renown activist, writer, poet. Angelou does nothing short of bare her heart and soul in this deeply personal and affecting narrative."

I had been wanting to read this for many years and Jean's gorgeous review pushed me over the edge to add this to my shortlist.Ms. Angelou's writing appears effortless and clear. The emotions and honesty ring through and you walk alongside her childhood and feel for her pain, enjoy her laughs and cheer her on her adventures.I love that she portrays herself with her anger alongside her compassion and speaks honestly about sexual abuse, abandonment, poverty, race relations, jealousy, desire, perseverance and a deep and uncompromising individuality.I will leave you with one of her painful rants about her race and the race of others:\"It was awful to be Negro and have no control over my life. It was brutal to be young and already trained to sit quietly and listen to charges brought against my color with no chance of defense. We should all be dead.

        "user_review": "May 2014: I wrote this review a year and a half ago. It is written from the perspective of a parent who cares about what her teenage children read in school. I hope it may be useful to other parents, teens, and anyone else who cares about content and wants to make informed decisions about what they read. I received mostly negative reactions to my review, but also a few positive comments which encouraged me. After a year of dealing with it all, I wanted to be done and move on, so I closed the comment section. If you wish to read through the comments, you'll see a few posts I wrote in reply. My final comments are in the last two posts. This is my personal reaction to the book, and I support your right to make your own choices about what you read, too.I read this book because my teenage son was going to be required to read it in his English class at school. I did not want to read the book because I was aware of its content. But I felt it necessary in order to be able to talk to the teacher about my objections. So I did not like this book. My degree in Comparative Literature enables me to recognize some literary value in Caged Bird, as well as historical and social value. I believe Maya Angelou is a talented writer. I admire some of her poetry. But her series of autobiographical books includes too much explicit and disturbing sexual content for me. And I certainly did not want my 15 year old son to have to read it! He did not want to read it and my husband and I completely supported his choice.The most graphic and disturbing sexual material in Caged Bird involves the rape of the author as an eight year old girl. This horrible experience deeply affects her life. But I believe our teenage children can understand that terrible things like this happen, without needing to be dragged through the muck of the sordid details. Ms. Angelou writes vividly. My son does not want those images in his head, and I fully support him. I can see this book being taught at the college level, but I strongly feel that it is not appropriate for high school required reading. In my son's advanced English class, this book was one of six main texts. In the regular English class, there are only two main texts, and this is one of them. How sad, when there are so many other great literary works to choose from which are clean.My son's teacher was nice and professional about it. Another English teacher was not so nice. She acted surprised that I would characterize the book as \"R-rated.\" She said that we could see worse things on prime-time TV. Our (my husband's and my) response was \"That's why we choose not to watch those TV shows!\" It bothered me that she would try to use the \"everybody's doing it\" excuse. Just because our society's standards of decency continue to plummet, is no reason to embrace them! It is an American Lit class, so I suggested a couple of other texts as options if the purpose was to address the African American experience. But this book is obviously one of that teacher's favorites, so she defended it. The teachers did say that our son could choose to read a different book. However, because the class structure was centered on discussion, we and our son chose to have him read an 'edited version' of Caged Bird instead. I just told him which chapters to skip. And I'm glad that our son happened to have the more sympathetic teacher.So I'm done with my rant now. Just needed to get that out. I'm glad that I love to read so I can be alert to what my children are exposed to at school. I know other parents who would also object to this book if they were more aware of the content. And I understand that it's hard to keep up with our kids sometimes. I expect we'll run into this problem again at the high school. But on the bright side, I also get to enjoy discussing good books with my children!"

        "user_review": "\" My tears were not for Bailey or Mother or even myself but for the helplessness of mortals who live on the sufferance of life\"How apt are these words and how true they ring? People really do take their lives for granted. It is of course a suffering. From birth to death. We should be shedding tears for the complete ignorance we carry ourselves for the reality the world offers which we fail to see, yet is it worth it? All those tears.It would be considered in a certain fact that reading this book during the current turbulent days is certainly fitting in a certain manner but some might think one is trying to be part of something they are not. Truth be told being a brown girl (as we've been constantly labeled) in a brown country surrounded by the ocean and other brown countries, I personally have not faced racism. In fact I have been brought up in my own cocoon. I am part of the majority that inhabit our tiny island, thus I have not received any judgement from any. The first time I felt out of my box was around 2 years ago. I was in Italy happily travelling by train from Milan to Switzerland when a certain Italian boy was curiously looking at me. I thought I was mistaken and ignored it. Later it came to my attention that he went as far as pointing at me and telling something to his mother. Me with zero knowledge of that language just smiled at him. I did not suspect anything until my aunt came to me and turned me away from them and took me away from there and told to just ignore them. Although she did not explicitly mention what was conversed between mother and child, I knew it was nothing good. This was my first time I ever felt as if I was an alien in another planet. It was the first time I felt as I was not accepted. Although this was for a very brief moment I felt a certain level of sadness, not anger but sadness. Not even knowing what they were saying I felt that I was accused of a crime I cannot even help. Now that I read this book, I cannot even fathom what colored people, let them be black, brown or yellow feel at a regular basis.Now that I have called myself brown and given the term yellow and black to others, what do I really try to achieve? Am I not putting the same labels that they have forced upon us? At times looking at the situation in the world a certain fear runs through my blood. Would we be next? Will there be a day that all colored people would be washed out of the world? Reasons are truly unfathomable for me. So many questions run through my mind when I see the blatant disgust people have towards each other.Why are we dirty?Black, brown, yellow, why are we so different from them?At the end aren't we all the same?Strip us down to the bones, won't we all be the same?Aren't we all made of the same tiny atoms?It is not that I am trying to bring up an argument by raising these questions, neither am I accusing anyone but in the end there is a certain kind of sadness that courses through my blood. No one deserves this. Why is it that even almost a century after these happening in the book that we have not changed at all?I will admit that I am speaking about things in general rather than book here but I do not think there is much to say about this. Maya Angelou has proven herself worthy of the praise. I am only sad that I did not pick this book up earlier. I do not know if it was the captivating words or lilting prose in the book but I truly felt as if I was in the embrace of a motherly bosom and listening to a fairy-tale while I was reading this. It truly captivated me and sent me to another realm. The story started with a simple yet small girl and ended with that small girl becoming woman when she was not a woman at all. At times I felt anger towards my own ignorance of the world and at time I felt anger at the world in general but I can easily discern that this book really was an eye opener and it truly did change my world. In the end I was not left with that anger but a bitter sadness in my heart. Will it ever end?\"All asked the same questions. How long, oh God? How long\""

        "user_review": "I was sitting on a bench as I enjoyed the last bits of warm sunlight the dying summer was oozing out, scrutinizing a newspaper while calculatedly assuming a thoughtful gaze.This little girl ran up to me. She said \"Mister, mister, I know why the caged bird sings!\"I looked up from reading the financial news. \"That's great kid. Now run along, can't you see I'm busy?\"I turned back to reading on how poorly the economy was doing. There's nothing like reading bad news to feed the intellect.\"But mister, mister, the caged bird sings and I know why! I know why, la-di-da, la-di-doo, and so should you!\"She skipped and danced excitedly. A bunch of people were standing around, bestowing benign smiles on the girl and throwing eager looks in my direction as an emphatic plea to hear her out. I heaved a sigh, put down the paper and said:\"Alright little one, tell me all about that bird of yours.\"So she started talking. About her grandmother Momma, how strong she was, about her momma Mother Dear, such a beautiful lady, about handsome and kind Brother Bailey and big and absent Father Bailey, about her little life in a little corner of a little shop. The corner, despite its size, offers the perfect vantage point to see what goes on in that big world and in the little minds that inhabit it. She tells excitedly of her sweet childhood memories and shares her keen observations. She offers an insider's view on a part of the world, a part of society, I was completely unfamiliar with. I'd heard about cotton pickers, of course. I saw them depicted in popular culture. But what I saw through her tales were not mere depictions but real life people, worn out by the burdens of their tasks. I saw their fatigue through the small spasms of pain surrounding their lips and quavering shoulders, the absence of the glint in their eyes as they were telling their jokes. But even as I looked into this unknown world many of it felt familiar to me and I realised that this unknown world is my world, our world, only there's this wall. Who put that stupid thing there? The little girl showed me the window in that wall and her generous spirit has left it wide open as the breeze of her story wafted through it.I willed her to keep talking and she did, with passion and patience.Suddenly the girl stopped dancing. Looking down at the ground she said, with a voice as tiny as a cat's whisker: \"A big man hurt me. Real bad.\"She looked up. The playful twinkle was gone. I was ready to stand up, hold her in my arms and tell her things would be fine. Her eyes, defiant, filled with pride and intelligence, told me she would have none of that. She started dancing again, slowly and more deliberately.More memories ensued. The tale matured into one dealing with one of society's biggest embarrassments, of black people not being allowed to work on tramcars, of dentists not wanting to treat little children with a specific ethnic background. But despite the enormity of all this humiliation, the little girl kept center stage, through her courage, wit and wisdom. Her pace quickened and I heard a melody of personal memories, powerful anecdotes and fiery statements of indignation.She sang \"The house was smudged with unspoken thoughts.\"A bit later she said: \"The unsaid words pushed roughly against the thoughts that we had no craft to verbalize, and crowded the room to uneasiness.\"Her apparent eloquence made the melodious statement all the more profound.The need for change bulldozed a road down the center of my mind.My relief melted my fears and they liquidly stole down my face.And then, a momentous description of the wall of racism. The girl just told me about how a lady receptionist wouldn't allow her to file a candidacy for a job she was coveting. The reasons were hidden yet obvious. The girl then sang:The miserable little encounter had nothing to do with me, the me of me, any more than it had to do with that silly clerk. The incident was a recurring dream, concocted years ago by stupid whites and it eternally came back to haunt us all. The secretary and I were like Hamlet and Laertes in the final scene, where, because of harm done by one ancestor to another, we were bound to duel to the death. Also because the play must end somewhere.I went further than forgiving the clerk, I accepted her as a fellow victim of the same puppeteer..I was awestruck, but she was obviously waiting for me to say something.\"What a wonderful tale! You're giving that clerk an easy pass there, but I'm sure that once you're a bit older you'll reconsider this imagery, however beautiful it is. But how about that bird, little girl? You didn't mention it, let alone the reasons for its singing?\"\"I ain't no little girl no more, mister!\"And with that, she stomped off in a fit of pique and out of my sight.I wonder if I'll ever see her again.I sure hope so.I want to know about that bird."

She 'listened' to the Audiobook. ( great idea I thought - and it sure was)...\"An American Classic\"...that once was a book people wanted banned from schools.Of course we always picked up new things when we read or listen to a book again....And something that really stood out for me this time around was that Deuteronomy was Maya's favorite book in the Bible.I knew that Shakespeare was her favorite author - but I hadn't remembered about Deuteronomy and why. As a young child Maya believed if people wanted to avoid hell, all they had to do was memorized Deuteronomy and follow its teachings word for word.When I went through B'nai Mitzvah and studied the Torah - Deuteronomy was my least favorite section. I didn't like 'the laws' and I remember being happy that our daughters both had Genesis, ( dealings with creation), as their portion of focus for their Bat Mitzvah.But... recently I dived into Deuteronomy.... which was inspired from reading \"Bitter Orange\", by Claire Fuller. ( a Priest wanted to leave the church in the story - and I wanted to understand why). I concluded he interpreted Deuteronomy more like a Jew than a Christian.Back to Maya....She wasn't able to avoid hell. A child who saw abandonment, racism,Social injustice, Discrimination every day as a child in the south, slavery, rape...( at 8 years of age)....she somehow became a legendary survivor ...\"Without willing it, I had gone from being ignorant of being ignorant to being aware of being aware.And The worst part of my awareness was that I wasn't aware of what I was aware of\".This book is timeless...Insightful - culturally historical... and Maya's autobiography.The little happy parts that had me smiling was when Marguerite and Baily were children - reading books - playing as little kids do...The 'meals' that came out of grandmas kitchen were abundant.I laughed at a breakfast visual of ham - eggs- potatoes -tomatoes - with so much ham fat poured on top of the tomatoes that they turned white.Our diets have change through history ....But so much importance in this gem of a book hasn't.Thanks, Suzy.., for the Audiobook 'inspiration'!Maya's voice was like having grandma read a bedtime story ...She could tell a story.Beautiful prose."

Maya Angelou is so inspirational to many people so reading about her childhood and adolescence was really special. I found her autobiography tragic and also hopeful at the same time. Things have changed a lot since Angelou's childhood, such as segregation, and colourism in the black community (to an extent). The fact that she went through that period of history and is alive to see the first Black president in US history is just wonderful."

        "user_review": "The first of a series of autobiographies by Maya Angelou,I Know Why the Caged Bird Singsis simultaneously heartrending and inspiring. This beautiful memoir of Ms. Angelou's years as a child up to the age of seventeen exemplifies the resilience of a strong human spirit. Living with her grandmother, uncle, and brother in the segregated state of Arkansas during the 1930's and early 1940's, Maya, or Marguerite as she was called, was forced to deal with abandonment, racial prejudices, and grievous abuse. And yet, Marguerite showed astonishing strength and courage through all this pain and hardship and emerged as a powerful role model for anyone that has suffered from hatred, injustice, or misfortune.Growing up, Marguerite reflects on what it was like to be a young black girl living during these times, as well as her insecurities regarding her own image. Not uncommon to many young girls, she felt awkward and plain. When describing her excitement over a new dress for church, Marguerite notes\"I was going to look like one of the sweet little white girls who were everybody's dream of what was right with the world\", and later …\"I thought that if she was planning to marry our father she must have been horrified to find herself with a nearly six-foot prospective stepdaughter who was not even pretty.\"I especially enjoyed Maya's descriptions of her love for books. Reading provided a refuge for little Marguerite, as well as an inspiration for her writing in her adult life. I could easily envision such cozy descriptions as\"There was going to be a storm and it was a perfect night for rereading Jane Eyre. Bailey had finished his chores and was already behind the stove with Mark Twain… Pots rattled in the kitchen where Momma was frying corn cakes to go with vegetable soup for supper, and the homey sounds and scents cushioned me as I read of Jane Eyre in the cold English mansion of a colder English gentleman.\"Food was a comfort for Marguerite as well and also provided for some very mouthwatering narrative. Humor and sarcasm were not lacking within the pages of Ms. Angelou's memoir either. Many of these moments seemed to have occurred while attending weekly church services or occasional revival meetings. Marguerite recalls going to church one morning while Reverend Thomas was preaching the words \"Great God of Mount Nebo\" and Sister Thomas, given to bouts of shouting and jerking when feeling the spirit, approached the Reverend, hit him with her purse, and knocked out his false teeth.\"The grinning uppers and lowers lay by my right shoe, looking empty and at the same time appearing to contain all the emptiness in the world.\"I could not keep myself from snickering along with Marguerite's contagious and hysterical laughter.Despite the books, the food and the humor, Marguerite suffered as well. One could not read this book without your heart going out to her when she experienced rage, loneliness, and physical and emotional pain. The retelling of some of the more horrific incidents in her life is astonishing, graphic, and brutal. But throughout this very personal account of Maya Angelou's early and formative years, we can see her little triumphs and celebrate with her. Reflecting on her graduation from the eighth grade, Maya says\"We were on top again. As always, again. We survived. The depths had been icy and dark, but now a bright sun spoke to our souls. I was no longer simply a member of the proud graduating class of 1940; I was a proud member of the wonderful, beautiful Negro race.\"Maya did survive and her numerous achievements point to her victory over adversity and injustice. I look forward to reading the next \"chapter\" in this inspirational woman's life story."

        "user_review": "\"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\"\"Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between.\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the first of Maya Angelou's seven autobiographies, is an engaging and remarkable memoir. It is the story of Maya (Marguerite) from the age of three until sixteen (along with her one-year older brother, Bailey Jr.). After the collapse of their parents' marriage, Maya and Bailey are sent to Depression-era Stamps, Arkansas with tags on their wrists addressed to \"To whom it may concern.\" No one, relatives included, seem much concerned with their comings and goings. The feeling that these children are on their own is reinforced along with the accompanying realization that, despite those lack of bonds, they are not free.Much of the story of segregated Stamps, Arkansas centers on prejudice at the hands of \"powhitetrash\" and how that impacts one's sense of self and place in society. Of course, this racism is also a big part of why freedom can be elusive even for someone with Maya's strength and resilience. Much of the second half of the book follows Maya's early teenage years in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Angelou writes this engaging memoir with sensitivity and beauty as well as a uniquely powerful voice. 4.25 stars"

        "user_review": "Maya Angelou ends her story of her youth with the birth of her son and that is a fitting ending for with a child comes an adult's responsibilities; although, she was only a teenager when she had him and had only had one very hasty and unsatisfying, almost impersonal, sexual experience to gain that son. It feels a bit abrupt when you are reading it, I had a son, the end.She had a disjointed upbringing with much movement between households, all over the country, ending up in San Francisco, by way of the deep South and other states along the way. Her mother and father divorced early and her first memories are of her father's mother who raised her. She and her brother, Bailey were moved to St. Louis to her mother's mother's house, then she moved with her mother, brother and a Mr. Freeman to an apartment in St. Louis. Since her mother was out working a lot, Mr. Freeman sexually assaulted her and eventually raped her. She was 8. Little girls and boys left alone with \"boyfriends\" often suffer this way. In this case she did eventually tell on him and there was a trial and he was found guilty, but only served one day in jail. He was found dead shortly after. Angelou thinks her uncles killed him.She loses her voice then literally and doesn't speak for years. She says it's because her speaking made a man lose his life, but maybe part of the reason was because she was traumatized and angry and she knew her relatives resented her for becoming a different child afterwards, sullen and sad, and they expected her to get over it and move on. Her silence was the answer to that.This is a moving memoir and very dark and she does move on, because she has to or give up. She turns to school and the power of words when nudged in that direction by a few gentle angels she meets along the way, teachers and good neighbors who bring light to the darkness."

        "user_review": "I have little interest in the conventional autobiography. It's a genre I associate with celebrities on the make for more publicity and more cash. There's also the sense a good novelist could condense all the relevant information in any autobiography into a couple of chapters and save us the chore of wading through 350 pages. It seems strange that through an autobiography we can, superficially, learn more about a stranger than we know about our own mother and father. It feels strange and it also feels bogus. A novel is essentially a writer getting us to believe a series of lies is the truth. An autobiography on the other hand is an individual claiming to tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. That in itself is an unrealistic claim. I think this is why we all love novels with an unreliable narrator. Because there's something fundamentally true about that perspective. Truth from one only perspective - monologue - is often unreliable because life after all is relationship.I know next to nothing about Maya Angelou. I don't know why she chose to write autobiography rather than fiction. I read this because I kept coming across fabulous quotes by her. Unfortunately none of those quotes cropped up in this book. There's nothing wrong with this book except perhaps the material is spread rather thinly but I had hoped the quality of the writing itself would be more exciting. Also she limits herself to the perspective of the person she was at the time and she's never older than seventeen in this book so there was little of her adult wisdom which was another disappointment."

        "user_review": "The first of Angelou's series of autobiographies and a powerful account of growing up and coming of age in 1930s/40s America. In the background and foreground are racism, violence against women and the problem of identity. It is written with clarity and great force; there is no hiding from what you are reading.It would be superfluous to sum up the book or outline its contents; it should be read. So I will just add a few thoughts and reflections.Beacuse of the strong brother/sister relationship, it has been compared toThe Mill on the Floss. That connection I didn't really see; Maggie and Tom Tulliver's relationship is too fractured and damaged by growing up, in a way that Maya and Bailey's was not.I understand that this is one of those books that has caused controversy when taught in school's in America. I can understand why that is (though I don't approve); the sexual violence is powerful, but Angelou is a bit of iconoclast and takes a swipe at a number of sacred cows. This is especially the case in relation to religion. Part of Angelou's genius is the way she seamlessly combines comedy, painful memories and tragedy.When reading this I was reminded of Hartley's memorable quote \"The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there\". There are times in relation to racism when I think (and hope) that is the case. I remember my youth and the casual racism that existed, even on TV. I look at today and see improvement and wonder how much of this is on the surface. Maybe I am a little pessimistic. But I do think we have to treat books like this as living breathing things; not as historical documents about a foreign past."

        "user_review": "In this first in her series of autobiographies, Maya Angelou shares the story of the early years of her life up to the age of seventeen. This memoir is more than just your average story, or even an average memoir because it's so poignant, so honest and yet shared through such lovely prose that it is hard for me to categorize it as just any one thing.Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to her father, Bailey Johnson, who was a naval dietician and her mother, Vivian Baxter Johnson, a nurse, her given name was Marguerite Annie Johnson, but her older brother, Bailey Jr., christened her \"Maya\" in his way of calling her as \"my sister.\"Such an incredibly inspiring and courageous woman, this was a joy to read at times, and heartbreaking to read at others, but what really stood out to me was how resilient she was, and yet how distressing it was that she had needed to be that strong.\"When I was three, and Bailey four, we had arrived in the musty little town, wearing tags on our wrists which instructed—\"To Whom It May Concern\"—that we were Marguerite and Bailey Johnson, Jr., from Long Beach, California, en route to Stamps, Arkansas, c/o Mrs. Annie Henderson.\"Our parents had decided to put an end to their calamitous marriage, and Father shipped us home to his mother. A porter had been charged with our welfare—he got off the train the next day in Arizona—and our tickets were pinned to my brother's inside coat pocket.\"Abandonment seems to haunt both Maya and Bailey even though there isn't much said in words, but they seem inured to it, as though they feel it is their lot in life to be left here, sent there. There are other lifelong scars, as well—sexual abuse, the racially divided, impoverished area they live in. Still, she manages to turn the roadblocks of her life into a life lived with inner and outer dignity and grace, inspiring so many along the way.After the deaths of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, who died on the fourth of April fifty-one years ago, in 1968, James Baldwin encouraged Maya Angelou to write her personal story. With that, she began this first installment in the story, or stories, of her life.I listened to this on audio, and also read this on my kindle, sometimes at the same time, and sometimes not. There's something about her voice, so soothing, I felt her words reach into my heart as though she's personally planted them there. Such a lovely way to take this journey along with her.Ninety-one years have passed since the day she was born, were she still alive, she would be celebrating her 91st birthday today. Fortunately, she's left us with her words, which live on. I raise a glass to Ms. Angelou, in gratitude to the gift of herself, her poetry and her stories, that she shared with all."

        "user_review": "When I picked up I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou I knew two things:1. The author is friends with Oprah and the Clintons.2. The book is considered a classic.The book is mostly set in the tiny town of Stamps, Arkansas. I lived much of my childhood within an hour's drive of Stamps so I found that detail very interesting.The account of life as a Negro (the term Ms. Angelou uses) in rural Arkansas was fascinating. Some of it brought to mind memories of my own childhood (though I am \"lily white\"). Ms. Angelou's detailed description of food left my mouth watering. Barbecue. Mmm! Fried chicken. Oh, yeah! Where can I get some of that?!I felt outrage at the shoddy treatment Maya and other Negoes in her community received at the hands of Whites. I sympathized with the fear of lynchings (which I confess I've never learned much about). And I admired their ability to feel proud and strong under oppressive circumstances.That's what I liked about the book.I did NOT appreciate the explicit descriptions of Maya's rape at age 8 by her mother's boyfriend. Or those of her 11 year old brother \"playing family\" in a tent in the backyard. Or of her emotionless experience with a teenage neighbor which leaves Maya pregnant.These accounts left me feeling sick to my stomach and in need of some way to cleanse my mind. I realize that these acts were horrendous but it seemed that Ms. Angelou went out of her way to make them as vulgar and disgusting as possible, which wasn't necessary to get her point across.It is outrageous to me is that this book is used in 9th and 10th grade English classrooms. This book is NOT appropriate for teenagers! I won't quote you the explicit details Ms. Angelou uses. Trust me, I've read trashy romance novels that had less detail than this book.So, because of the explicit portions of the book, I cannot recommend it to anyone. Not adult. Definitely NOT teenager.Edited October 2014:About once a year I come to this review and read all of the comments that people have left. The older I get (now 40 yrs old) and the older my kids get (currently 6-11 yrs old) the more I stand by my review.This book is disturbing. The descriptions of sexual abuse are graphic. The thing about words and images is they burn themselves into our minds. They influence our thinking and our decision-making, often without us realizing it. If they didn't influence us then there would be no purpose for their existence. That's why we must be careful about what we expose ourselves to!I am saddened that the overwhelming argument in the comments FOR tweens/teens reading this book is that it's no worse than what they are exposed to in their interactions with friends, or what they view on TV/movies. Just because they've already learned about rape doesn't make that knowledge healthy or good for them!That's called 'desensitization.' When you are exposed to something over and over it eventually loses it's power to influence you; it impacts your emotions and thoughts differently than when you were first exposed. Eventually you lose the sense of shock, horror, and outrage. You become numb or calloused.I do not want to ever become numb or calloused to the horror of sexual abuse. To do so would dishonor my real life friends who endured sexual abuse. It would belittle the 8 yr old victim of the level two child molester living in my neighborhood (that I learned about today).The other argument for this book is to educate about the terribleness of sexual abuse. Education of this nature should always have a purpose.Knowledge just for the sake of knowledge is only good if you are a contestant on a game show.Reading this book influenced me in two ways: it made me more committed to choose age-appropriate materials for my children AND to empower my children to handle inappropriate situations.We talk a lot about how private parts of your body are ONLY for you and if anyone asks to see them or touches them you tell your parents. We discuss NOT going somewhere alone with an adult. We also explain that some movies/TV shows are not appropriate for them at their current ages.We make these choices for our children because an education of this graphic level would have no purpose. It would only horrify and frighten them. Eventually we will educate our children about the proliferation of child pornography, about child sexual abuse, about the sex slave trade that is alive in well in our country and around the world. We won't need to go into graphic detail because the horror of such activities is natural.After they are educated we will offer them outlets for their outrage. We will provide a list of organizations that fight these atrocities that we can support with our time and money. We will teach them to write letters to government officials on behalf of good legislation.In other words we will give them the means to DO something with their horror; to act on their education. Which ought to be the purpose of all education.Okay, so you read the book. You are now 'educated.' What are you going to DO with that education? How has this education changed you, your thinking, motivated your actions? How does this knowledge influence you?"

        "user_review": "I Know Why the Caged Bird Singswas Maya Angelou's first book, and as I was reading I recognized how revolutionary it must have been when it was released. There was (and still is) a whole world of people with little conception of what southern, rural black people went through before and during the civil rights movement (and while I've read more on this topic than some, I would include myself in that number), so seeing that time and place reflected here has undeniably been extremely valuable for many—both those who lived it and those who did not. In addition, her depiction of the events and emotions leading up to and following her childhood rape was quite striking and must have been astoundingly groundbreaking when it first appeared in print. I could also see quite clearly how this memoir has influenced subsequent generations of writers and filmmakers. Its importance cannot be overstated. As a reading experience, however, it was a bit more mixed for me. Some of the writing was beautiful and vivid, with a strong sense of place and character, but some was a little more rough and choppy, and the episodic nature of the book didn't work particularly well, in my opinion. For a first book, these are forgivable flaws, and I would never discourage anyone from reading this memoir—in fact, I think everyone should read it. But for me what it mainly did was make me want to read Angelou's later books, where presumably she gains full possession of the writerly powers beginning to emerge here."

        "user_review": "Now that I've researched, read, and reviewed a number of banned and challenged books, I'm no longer surprised that writing about sex, particularly from a young woman's point of view, whips up fear and suppression. And there's plenty of sex in Maya Angelou's childhood memoir, starting with her rape, at the age of 9, by her mother's live-in boyfriend, continuing with her description of her mother's life as a prostitute, her adventures in Mexico while her father visits a whorehouse, her teen-aged fear of being a lesbian, and her first self-initiated sexual encounter and subsequent pregnancy at the age of 16. But that's not all: she pokes fun at her grandmother's old-fashioned Arkansas Christianity and morality; she glorifies inner-city black lawlessness and crime; she lives in a junkyard for a month with other homeless children; she's scornful of white people. Worst of all from the censors' view, I suspect, is that she does not accept her place: she's smart, determined, and uppity. As far as Maya Angelou's own writing, I have to say that while she captured me throughout first two-thirds of the book, she lost me during the last third . . . I went from being absorbed and engaged to merely reading out of academic interest. From the time she runs away from her father in Los Angeles, the tone of her writing changes: detailed recollections of childhood, filled with fascinating detail, humor, and astute observations of character, suddenly stop, and Maya's memoir becomes compressed, rushed, and vague. Huge and important things happen afterward: her brother runs away from home; she becomes the first black streetcar employee in San Francisco; she decides to prove she is not a \"pervert\" (her own word) by asking a neighbor boy to have sex with her; she becomes pregnant and has a child -- but Maya covers all this in a hurry, almost as if she's writing about someone else. I don't understand why she put aside the momentum she'd built up during the first two-thirds of her memoir, and that makes me like I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings a little less than I want to. Still, it's an important, ground-breaking book, and there are three very good reasons to read it: one, to tweak the censors' noses; two, to learn something of what it is to be a black girl in America; three, to hear the voice of a strong black woman who is not Oprah!"

        "user_review": "4.5 starsI Know Why the Caged Bird Singsis a personal account told in the voice of a child cleverly reconstructed by an adult narrator. Through the observations of Maya, the child, comes a coming-of-age story - a social record of a young black female growing up in the 1930s. As an historical document 'Caged Bird' covers the bigotry, cruelty, oppression and the constant threat of death that constituted daily life in the South.The caged bird singswith a fearful trillof things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hillfor the caged birdsings of freedom.*The autobiography is also a representation that can be read as a feminist observation.The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power.Maya was fortunate to have the unbending support from strong, financially independent, no-nonsense women like Momma (her paternal grandmother) who owned land and a grocery business, her mother Vivian who owned a gambling hall, and even her politically well-placed, octoroon maternal grandmother Baxter: all whose convictions not to be dependent on men, provided Maya with the foundation on which to build her self-assurance.But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreamshis shadow shouts on a nightmare screamhis wings are clipped and his feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing.*More significantly, after the violent traumatic and pivotal experience of her young life from which she 'loses' her speech, we are reminded that abject struggle often precede success; it is through her strong willed teacher, Mrs. Flowers, that Maya finds confidence, self worth and retrieves from imprisonment her voice. The last part of Maya's journey through adolescence is poignant in the mother/ daughter / infant visual, and although she is still uncertain and insecure, she receives the promise of maturity:Mother whispered, \"See, you don't have to think about doing the right thing. If you're for the right thing, then you do it without thinking.\"The free bird thinks of another breezeand the trade winds soft through the sighing treesand the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawnand he names the sky his own.*Maya Angelou eloquently articulated how the painful struggles and scattered happy experiences of growing up in the South had a significant role in the shaping of the gifted, outspoken, determined, inspirational person she became.The free bird leapson the back of the windand floats downstreamtill the current endsand dips his wingsin the orange sun raysand dares to claim the sky.*I Know Why the Caged Bird Singsis the first in the magnificent six-volume autobiography of Maya Angelou (April 1928 - May 2014): a poet, author, civil rights activist, professor, feminist. A brilliant achievement, highly recommend. My copy is fromThe Collected Autobiographies of Maya Angelou( Modern Library) 2012*verses from the poem 'Caged Bird' by Maya Angelou, are not presented in original sequence."

        "user_review": "Maya Angelou, born Marguerite Annie Johnson in 1928, was an African-American poet, singer, actress, writer, director, producer, composer, and civil rights activist. This first book of Angelou's seven-part autobiography covers her childhood and adolescence, up to the age of seventeen.Angelou had a turbulent childhood, beginning with her parents' divorce when she was three years old. At that time, Marguerite and her beloved four-year-old brother Bailey were sent from their father's home in California to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their paternal grandmother Annie Henderson.Little Marguerite Annie JohnsonMap showing Stamps, ArkansasStamps was a southern town, and Angelou notes, \"In Stamps the segregation was so complete that most black children didn't really, absolutely know what whites looked like.\" Unfortunately, Marguerite's limited interaction with the racist white population made an everlasting impression on her.Marguerite and Bailey's grandmother, whom the children called Momma, was an entrepreneur. She owned a plot of land and lived in her shop, called The Store, which sold food and candy to the Negro population of Stamps.Momma was strict, and Marguerite and Bailey were expected to go to school, do their homework, finish their chores, and help in The Store before going out to play or perusing their books. The children were avid readers who knew their multiplication tables by heart thanks to crippled Uncle Willie - who tested them regularly. Marguerite's favorite treats from the shop were foil covered chocolate kisses and canned pineapple - which was a very rare treat.Momma was a devout Christian who prayed each morning and took the children to Church every Sunday. In addition, Momma periodically hosted Reverend Howard Thomas (Elder Thomas) who presided over the local church district. Elder Thomas visited Stamps every few months, and ate and slept at Momma's house. Marguerite and Bailey disliked the man because he was big and pompous and prayed so long over breakfast that the food became cold and congealed.Marguerite became anxious when she had an errand in the white part of town because she was frightened of whites - who disdained and mistreated Negroes. This impudent attitude even extended to white trash youngsters, who - when they bought snacks in Momma's Store - were rude and insolent. Once, when a few shabby, grime-covered little white girls made fun of Momma, Marguerite was reduced to tears.Stamps was especially dangerous for black men, who were in constant danger of being lynched.When a 'friendly sheriff' came by to warn Momma that a group of white men was looking for a black troublemaker, Grandmother hid disabled Uncle Willie deep under the produce in a vegetable bin. It was good that the white men didn't come by, because Uncle Willie moaned loudly all night.All this prejudice and hatred had a profound impact on young Marguerite, who sometimes fantasized that she was a pretty white girl with silky blonde hair.When Marguerite was eight, her father came to get her and Bailey, and brought them to their mother Vivian in St. Louis, Missouri. Marguerite didn't want to go, but upon arrival was charmed by her beautiful vivacious 'Mother Dear.' Unlike Momma, Vivian smoked, laughed, joked, danced, and made parties.Vivian Baxter (Maya Angelou's mother)Young Marguerite, who had nightmares, would sometimes sleep with Vivian and her boyfriend Mr. Freeman. Unfortunately - when Vivian left for work - Mr. Freeman would touch Marguerite inappropriately.....and he eventually raped her. Mr. Freeman threatened 8-year-old Marguerite with dire consequences if she told anyone, so the terrified child kept mum.Marguerite at age nineVivian found out anyway, which resulted in an arrest, a trial, and EXTREME vigilante justice by Marguerite's uncles. Afterwards, Marguerite and Bailey were sent back to Stamps, but the girl was so freaked out - thinking her testimony had led to Mr. Freeman's death - that she stopped speaking for several years.It took finesse - and books - from a caring educator called Mrs. Bertha Flowers to get Marguerite talking again, and perhaps to foster the girl's interest in a literary career.Before leaving Stamps for good Marguerite had another unpleasant encounter with a white person. Marguerite's habit of sneaking candy bars from Momma's store resulted in horrific tooth decay and an excruciating toothache - so bad that Marguerite hoped the house would collapse on her jaw.There was no black dentist in Stamps, so Momma took Marguerite to the white dentist, Dr. Lincoln - who had borrowed money from Grandmother during the Depression. Dr. Lincoln didn't even look at the suffering child, and told Momma, \"I'd rather stick my hand in a dog's mouth than in a n*****r's.\" Grandmother then shamed 10 dollars of \"interest\" out of the nasty man, and took Marguerite to a Negro dentist in Texarkana.A few years later, after teenage Bailey was horrified by the bloated body of a Negro killed by whites, Momma decided the children had to leave Stamps for good. Grandmother made sure the children got settled with their mother in San Francisco, where glamorous Vivian ran gambling clubs, hung out with a wild crowd, and lived with her beau (and later husband) Daddy Clidell. Unlike Mr. Freeman, Daddy Clidell was a fine man who was good to Marguerite.Marguerite continued attending school and - at 15 years of age - became the first black conductress on the streetcars of San Francisco. To get the job, Marguerite claimed to be 19 and lobbied hard for weeks, showing the mettle that served her so well in life.Conductress MargueriteAfterwards, during a summer visit with her father Bailey Sr. and his girlfriend Dolores in southern California, Marguerite had a wild adventure in Mexico. Marguerite and her dad went across the border to 'buy tortillas' and - after a raucous night of drinking and philandering - Bailey Sr. was completely knocked out. Marguerite loaded him into the back seat of their car, and - though she'd never driven before - transported Bailey Sr. 50 miles down the mountain before she had a minor accident.This incident was followed by a physical altercation with Dad's jealous girlfriend Dolores, who cut Marguerite badly. Teenage Marguerite then ran away and lived on the streets of southern California for a month, where she made friends with other homeless kids and slept in junkyard cars. Finally, Marguerite returned to San Francisco to continue school.Meanwhile Bailey Jr. - observing his mother's unconventional lifestyle and feeling jealous of her zoot-suited friends - started acting out. He became surly, took up with an old prostitute, and acted like he was a big man - though he was only 17. This got Bailey Jr. thrown out of the house.....much to Marguerite's dismay.Man wearing a zoot suitLack of proper sex education left Marguerite confused about her sexuality, and physical changes in her vagina made the girl think she might be 'becoming a lesbian.' To put the matter to rest, 16-year-old Marguerite seduced a handsome young neighbor boy....and promptly became pregnant.Marguerite's mom Vivian, busy working - and opening a club in Alaska - noticed nothing until the girl was very far along. When Vivian finally learned of her daughter's pregnancy, she stepped up and became a solicitous and helpful grandma. The birth of Marguerite's son ends the book.There are many additional scenes and people in the autobiography, including young Marguerite's best friend Louise; pre-teen Bailey Jr.'s first girlfriend Joyce (a 'loose' gal); sketches from the Depression; Marguerite's proud 8th grade graduation; and much more. All this gives us a good feel for the children's early years. Sadly, Marguerite and her brother were damaged by their parents' casual neglect, and made to feel inferior by blatant white bigotry. This deeply affected Marguerite for her entire life.You can follow my reviews athttps://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

        "user_review": "I originally had not planned on even reading this book because the Twilight series instills much rage within my soul, but I was in a dry spell for reading, so I decided to give it a try. I have to say I really enjoyed it much more than the Twilight series. I have seen a lot of people complain about how slow the beginning was, but I didn't really notice. It sucked me in pretty quickly. It was very clearly a Stephenie Meyer book, though, which did lead to certain amounts of anger and eyes rolling nearly out of my head.---My biggest complaint with Stephenie Meyer is her romantic plots. I feel like I've accidentally picked up a Harlequin romance. It is super cheesy and super melodramatic. It makes my brain hurt. Here's an example: \"I stared into Jared's eyes, and the strangest thing happened. All the melting, melding, welding that I had just been through was shoved aside, into the smallest part of my body, the little corner that I took up physically. The rest of me yearned toward Jared with the same desperate, half-crazed hunger I'd felt since the first time I'd seen him here. This body barely belonged to me or to Mel—it belonged to him\" (595, ARC). WHAT! First, horribly cheesy. Second, nobody but you owns your body, and if you find it romantic to think otherwise, that is unhealthy. Let's learn some emotional and physical independence!What the hell is up with underage characters and older men?! Why could the females not be slightly older? This is supposedly being marketed as an adult book, so maybe it's a bit alienating to make your main character(s) 16 when she first meets Jared who was 26, then 17 when she was starting in a new body (which they thought was younger!) when Ian is in his mid-20's (I am guessing).I'm just glad the romantic interests were not supposed to be seen as perfect. They had similar flaws as Edward & Jacob, but we were not reminded every 20 seconds how easily they dazzled everyone. Jared can barely stand Wanderer for most of the book. He would kill her easily if it weren't Mel's body. He is cruel and violent towards her. Ian is the first to physically assault her. And then in the end he does it again, while also being a bit violent toward Sunny & Jared. Of course, Ian ends up pretty near perfect with his perfect understanding and perfect kindness and perfect love. But I will accept this because I think that his perfect personality fits with the gentle, loving, peaceful personality of Wanderer.---While still cheesy, there were bits that were not romance-based that were emotionally compelling. I felt Wanderer's fear about what she had to do in the end. In the tunnel on the way to Doc for the last time, when she asked Jared where everyone slept when it rained, my heart ached for her. I thought that was a lovely way of noting how much she still really wanted to find out about this world and how much she was going to miss and that life was going to go on without her. I know, I know, we are being emotionally manipulated, because if you don't know how it's going to end before you even pick it up, you haven't read enough in life. But if you put yourself in the character��s place when she has a very clear idea of what is going to happen, it's pretty sad.---The thing that made me love this is that it is not a romance. It is a story about humanity with romance thrown in. I like looking at humanity through alien eyes. I like learning what it means to be human with Wanderer. I like the interactions between Mel and Wanderer. I like that Wanderer picked up sarcasm from Mel. I love how absolutely confused she initially is by humans. She views humans as violent, hateful creatures. She is confused when they feed and protect her. This completely goes against her view of humanity.I like how we perceive the humans through her eyes, how we get an idea of their motives from her which she is normally wrong about, and then we slowly see the change. This is seen especially with Doc.I enjoyed seeing how Wanderer reacted to humans and how her perception of them changed. She goes from being terrified of humans to constantly surprised and confused by how good they end up being to loving them and embracing her own humanity. But throughout it she is ashamed of betraying her kind and feels like a traitor. She constantly second guesses herself, whether it's in favor of the humans or the souls. It's not until the end when she really accepts that maybe what she does is wrong, but if it brings about good then it's the best thing for her to do.---I like the question of how much of yourself comes from some ethereal personality/soul and how much comes from your physical body. What makes us human? What parts of us do people fall in love with? Are we more physical, spiritual, emotional? It's a bit cheesy (have I said that enough?), but I like the idea portrayed when Ian says, \"It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the things you do with it\" (p. 397, ARC). And then we get to see Wanderer in two different bodies which change her a bit. We have weak v. strong, etc. When in Mel's body, Wanderer feels a physical longing for Jared but an emotional one for Ian. After she is put in a new body, she still loves Jared. Melanie occasionally seems overly familiar with Ian before remembering who she is. Jared stares searchingly and confusedly at Wanderer. What makes someone who they are? What part of a person do others connect with?---There are a lot of small touches that really pleased me. I love how people act and react in this book.I thought it was hilarious when Wes (?) said, \"You may have taken the planet, but you're losing this game,\" when they were playing soccer. That's just funny to me. If you can't use humor to cope with the apocalypse, you'll never make it.A reaction that rings completely true is when, after Wanderer walks in on the dissections and is absolutely horrified, the guys are confused about why she is so upset when they were sure to cover the bodies so she couldn't have seen anything. However, they only covered the human bodies. They still see the souls as alien and other which negates understanding and compassion.I love what happens in the following bit: \"'Ah,' the seeker's familiar voice moaned from the human body. 'Ah.' / The room went utterly silent. Everyone looked at me, as if I were the expert on humans\" (p. 553, ARC). Of course that is how they would react when she is the one who knows how to bring the humans back!---One theme of the book is belonging. What makes one belong? Wanderer does not think she belongs in the cave because she is not human. Many of the humans agree. But she becomes part of the community, and her friends, who have gotten to know her and thus care about her, believe she belongs. Jeb never calls her 'it', and as the others get to know her they stop doing this. Lacey is instantly accepted by many of the humans because she is human (or becomes human again). But she has a hateful personality, and most of the main characters do not like her. Jeb refers to her as 'that creature'. So what makes us belong somewhere?---I think the characterization is actually not terrible.Ian, for instance, initially comes off as cruel and violent (he tries to kill her), but he's just reacting to his world being taken over by beings who want to basically kill all humans. We see that he has the capacity to be kind, to gain perspective, to learn to understand. Granted, it seemed a bit incongruous to go from Killer to Most Compassionate & Loving Person Alive Ever in such a short time, but I'll take what I can get from Meyer.Even Kyle is developed, though it mostly comes up in the end. Initially, he is just the villain of the story, but once Sunny is brought in we see that, yeah, he is rash and selfish and arrogant and angry, but he can be gentle and kind. And we don't see this 180 done on his character where all of a sudden, out of the blue, he is capable of love. We know he had a girlfriend before this all started. Someone, at some point, must have seen some good stuff in him. And his grief at losing his world is manifest through anger and violence towards those who destroyed it. Sunny looks at him as her protector, but he doesn't jump into a relationship with Sunny. He wants Jodi back. But through his interactions with Sunny, he gains understanding. He is confused by her reaction to initially meeting him and is surprised he can be so kind to her. He is compassionate when she realizes what is going to happen and is terrified, he didn't realize it would be that hard. Once Jodi doesn't come back, he has Sunny put back in her body, and he takes care of her. But he's confused by it all; he doesn't know what he's doing or how to have a relationship with her. As shocked as I am by this, Meyer is able to create a character that grows but still remains himself.---I did have a problem with the ending. It's just too neat and happy. While I was amused and pleased that Jared held a knife to Doc to get him to save Wanderer, it's way too pat of an ending. Of course, you knew it would happen from the beginning, but I have to wonder whether it would be a better ending to just let her die. She's lived, she's learned, it's her time to go. Life and love go on even in the face of death, as Meyer reminds us numerous times. Show us how the humans cope, how they do on their own once she's gone. Of course, she is the main character of the book, so maybe allowing her to continue learning how to be human is not such a bad thing. And we know how Meyer hates making her characters suffer any type of consequence..."

To sum up my impressions of this story -WAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! WHYYYYYYY???**This refers to the pointless waste of an entire tropical forest on the printing of this 600+ pager in whichNOTHINGhappens. I kid you not.****Well, what else did I expect from a woman who created sparkly virgin vampires??? Hanging my head in shame.******In my defense, here is the quote from thistrainwreckbook:\"Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached.\"Maybe I expected the highs (just teeny-tiny highs) afterTwilightthe sparkly book I don't speak of?********This definitely had the aforementioned lows, but also a conspicuous absence of highs. And it didn't even have the unintentional hilarity ofTwilightsparklyseries.WAAAHHHHHH!!!!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT!There will be amovie.It IS happening (unlike the book, in which nothing is).Ok, it's old news, but I am behind on my pop culture.The important thing is - the movie stills are out.And they highlight the very important way in which it differs fromTwilight- the male love interest is wearing a *gasp*SHIRT!!! In both pictures.Proof:-------------------------------------------------------------------------Alright, enough of the silliness. Let's get to business. This book COULD HAVE HAD potential. The premise can be interesting - our planet overtaken by mind-controllingcentipedessouls, it takes people a while to realize that the invasion had happened, and the resistance emerges. Add to it that the invaders are apparently looking for little more than world peace - and this has the beginnings of a fun sci-fi-ish story.Alas, that didn't happen.**************Our lovely protagonist, ladies and gentlemen! (My vision)Let's immediately clarify - this \"sci-fi romance\" (as I have seen it described) is neither sci-fi nor romance.Instead we have a watered-down story of sometimes angry overprotective men pushing around and ordering around the helpless, meek, anxious, and \"selfless\" heroine - and occasionally carrying \"their women\" around (as all men are prone to doing in Ms. Meyer's books). There is a lot of brooding, glaring, staring, whispering, and murmuring (was Ms. Meyer paid extra for every instance of \"murmur\" in the book? It would seem so). The narration is weak, lazy, and overly dramatic. The characters are caricatures. Pages and pages go by withoutANYTHINGhappening. Boring. YAWN.This book deservesZERO stars. It is to literature whatGigliwas to movies(Anyone remember that awfulness? Probably not, as I was likely the only sane human who saw it. Again - masochism). Your time is precious; please don't waste it onThe Host.Do anything else instead - likewatching paint dry, which still would be more enjoyable.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Edited to add (in bewilderment):This \"book\" has a 3.86 rating on GR. Am I reading the same thing as everyone else? Was my copy of this book defective in any way?"

She's found a home (and a human) that she wants forever.What was it that made this human love so much more desirable to me than the love of my own kind? Was it...Because these humans hate with so much fury, was the other end of the spectrum that they could love with more heart and zeal and fire?I just adore this book.I've read it once every 2-3 years and enjoyed it every time. This was no exception.Normally, when character who is too good to be true (looking at you, Wanderer), it annoys me.Not with this book.Wanderer might be nearly perfect, but her internal conflict and the external factors (i.e. Melanie, other humans) provide enough tension to keep her from seeming like a Mary-Sue.This bookis a slow buildbut it is so worth it to me.

        "user_review": "I really did enjoy this book. It is narrated in the same style at the Twilight book in the first person. The things that make this book really good are the internal dialogue between the main characters Melanie and Wanda. I am told that this did not work too well in the movie, but as a book, it makes great interesting reading.The story of an alien invasion has happened we the humans have lost or have we? The Aliens call themselves Souls; they think it is the closest translation from our language. They are parasitic/symbiotic in nature. They are inserted into through the back of the neck and attach themselves to our brains and control our bodies. They have done this on at least eight other different planets. The society seem to have 3 classes: Healers, their Doctors, seekers, their police force, and the general populace (they are never referred to as more then Souls). Their occupation seem more a seeking of knowledge and experiences that maliciously or ambitious. The aliens do not seem to be well armed and do not like violence. The invasion has been more stealthy, slowly taking over people and their neighbours before any realised. Most of the technology seems to have been concentrated on healing and space travel.The reason I ask the question is did ne lose is because on all the other planets they have conquered, they have never met a species that is conflicted, emotional diverse all at the same time. The other species offered little or no resistance, and the aliens were just accepted. The Aliens seem to have no personality of their own in their natural states. The personalities seem to be the sum of their experiences from previous and current hosts. The only real method of telling if some have been taken over is their eyes.Melanie is one of the few humans left, till she is captured, she tries to kill herself rather than submit to being taken over, but the aliens heal her body. The soul she is bonded with is called the Wanderer because of all the worlds she has visited but never settled on for more than one hosts lifetime. Usually, this is it. The soul takes over and replaces the Host with full access to their memories and carries on living their lives. Melanie, being the fighter she refuses to, goes quietly he is present and voiced constantly with the Wanderer. As the story goes on, we find this is happening more and more strong will Humans refuse to give the aliens full control.Using or being led by Melanie, Wanderer finds possible the last outpost of pure Humans. If she has any hope of surviving, Wanderer must make peace with Melanie; then, together, they must try and convince the humans they mean no harm. Both sided must put aside their preconception of the other and try to find common ground. This is a great story about the human spirit. The language is definitely at a higher level than Twilight probably because Meyer has realised her fans have grown older. Meyer's writing style has a good story telling flow to it. I enjoyed reading the whole book. The only thing I would grip about is the lack of action in the book; there was more action in the football game and the bonus chapter \"Alone\" than in the rest of the book. However, she was writing more for emotional content than action. This is an intelligent, different story, seen through the eyes of both humans and aliens."

        "user_review": "It's no secret that I did not jump on the Twilight bandwagon. I put my name on the hold list at the library for The Host, however, because I wanted to see if Stephenie Meyer had improved in her storytelling. I'm happy to say, \"Yes, she did. To a point.\"I would like someone tell me what her fascination is with sappy, overly dramatic dialogue, 17-year old girls and over-protective older men who carry them while running? Because there are some definite similarities here.I find it interesting that this novel is pegged for \"adults\" where the Twilight novels were pegged \"young adult\" as I don't see a great deal of difference, except for one main fact: Wanda and Melanie are likeable. Thank goodness. If one of them had shown up as whiny and annoying as Bella, I never would have finished the book. Well, I would have finished it, but only to say, \"I told you so.\"While I found a lot of similarity to the Twilight novels in her storytelling and in the details (over-protective older men, teenage girls, dramatic sappy dialogue, etc.) this was a much better story. Far more developed than I would have expected. It still takes her a long time to get to her main points, but I wasn't as bored with this one in the beginning as I was with Twilight.I found the storyline fascinating: that aliens who invade other planets and take over the species, invade earth and take over the human bodies and then live as humans. Wanda is one of those aliens, a \"soul\" who takes over Melanie's body, only to find out that Melanie isn't quite ready to give it up. This is where Meyer's storytelling has improved. She crafted a story where the romance was secondary to the main plot, and I think that is why this book is so much better than her earlier attempts. She explores the idea of a person's soul or spirit and how an individual is defined as much by that spirit as by their physical body.I thought her character development was well done. I liked these characters. I cared about them. I don't need to tell you that I never cared about Bella. I enjoyed the complexities that the storyline created. Wanda was affected by Melanie's memories and feelings and couldn't help but love the man Melanie loved. Then, when she found herself caring for a different man, the conflict is believable. The humans have a difficult time accepting Wanda, but when they do, she truly becomes one of them.The novel ends neatly, with hope. Predictably there is room for a sequel, which I no doubt expect.I'd actually re-read this book. I won't re-read the others."

I really, really love it!At first sight it looks like it's a book about aliens, but in reality it's about the human kind and it's questioning how much humanity remains in us all.It's a book about survival, about love (so many types of love: loving yourself, loving the planet you live on, loving your family, your friends), about finding yourself... a book about trust, friendship and faith.It starts kind of slow, but as you get through the story you can see how amazing it can be... so captivating, so entertaining.The main characters are Melanie and Wanda (the body and the soul) and they take you in a journey not only to find the people they love but to find themselves, to understand the reasons to lose everything for love, the reason to give your life for the people you can't live without.There is enough action to keep you reading, but the story is deeper than that, it's not about what the characters do but why they do that, it's not about whom they love but why they can't resist the feeling, it's not about what they say but about what they think.This book is all about emotions, and reading about how the characters feel in every scene makes the story so real, so true... you can feel the pain, the anger, the faith, the love, the hope... it's a carousel of emotions and that is what makes this book so good, because it's just so close to your heart.If you are looking for adventure and lots of action and UFOs this is not a book for you, but if you are looking for an emotional, tear-dropping story this might be the one.Note: You can read my latest review for this bookhere, but only if you've read the book, as it contains various spoilers.Happy midnight reading!* This review can also be found atReadingAfterMidnight.com____________________________________________Blog (EN)|Facebook|Twitter|Tumblr|Bloglovin'|Blog (RO)____________________________________________Later Edit 1: Check my 3rd book boyfriend:Ian O'Shea"

Unfortunately, those cannot be precisely translated into the English language.Holy Crap. HOLY CRAP!! I can't even process my thoughts to write a review for this. This book was so stunning, so amazing, so crazy good that I can't even describe it. XD I'm extremely impressed of Stephenie Meyer. This beats Twilight by a long shot; it's SO much better. She writes so much better in this book, and the complex, in-depth plot is nothing compared to Twilight's shallow one.The idea is so cool. The characters are awesome and lovable. Stephenie Meyer is incredibly skilled with emotion; that's her strongest suit. She writes emotion in a way that makes you feel everything the character feels. When the character is in pain, the reader is in pain too.Meyer writes love in a way that makes you love everything and everyone the character loves with a strong passion. Even though he was just a character, I loved Jamie as strongly as if he was my own brother. And I was in love with Ian as strongly as if I was Wanda and he was actually real. Stephenie Meyer is a queen of emotion; I don't think anyone can write it like she can.This was just so much better than Twilight, and that was so relieving. Even though I enjoyed Twilight, it's nice to see that the same author is capable of writing something that isn't shallow in the slightest, and writing something so much better than Twilight. This book just blew me away.I actually cried at the end. In fact, I cried several times throughout the book, it was so good. :) The funny thing is, I didn't cry at the end because of the reason that everyone else cried. I cried because what everyone thought was the end of the book, WASN'T the end. I cried because Meyer changed it from the perfect, bittersweet sad ending, to a happy-dovey ending. I wish she made the ending the chapter before the last, the one before she skipped pages in the book. (I'm trying not to spoil things here ;D.)Apparently, Meyer is making a second book. I kind of wish she wasn't. While it would be nice to read the next one, I feel like The Host would be best as a stand-alone novel, and to make it into a series would just ruin it. This is a storyline that would best not be continued. I don't know.Anyways. The Host is a phenomenon and everyone who hasn't read it must go get it now. It is an essential read. XD"

        "user_review": "I wanted to like this book more than I did--to see that Stephenie Meyer can pick a topic not meant for shallow teenage girls and write on a deeper level--but I think this book is more of the same, sans the vampire excitement. I liked the idea: an alien soul inhibiting the host body of a girl who doesn't want to relinquish her control and the conflicts that arise, particularly in romance. There are some interesting topics, like what defines humanity and are we living worthy enough for the planet we are entrusted. The story isn't as page-turning as Twilight, but mulling nonetheless.My problem with Stephenie Meyer is her characters. They seem shallow, unbelievable, and small variants on her same cookie cutter. Her girls in particular are, well dumb, always jumping to the wrong conclusions, never wanting to believe they could be loved. Your damsel in distress. I am often exasperated by the emotion and stupidity of her female characters. I tried to allow for the alien learning curve, but when solutions and realizations are painfully obvious to me chapters before they are explored by the characters it creates frustratingly slow plot progression.The mold for guys is more frustrating because they exhibit none of the characters I am drawn to, and even ones I despise. They are always big, strong, forceful verging on the abusive side of controlling with a scary tendency to irrational jealousy and anger. They are emotionally immature, intense, and display their passion with an abnormal display of affection and cheesiness to the women who make them crazy with love. I don't trust intensely passionate men. (I did like Jeb's character but he wasn't a main romantic interest characters so he didn't need to be intense.)Because of this conversations were unrealistic. I could not imagine real people speaking this way so the story felt childish at times. The cheese is laid on so thickly in parts I could not swallow it. This is supposed to be a more adult-themed book, but in many ways I found it less adult enticing and more juvenile in tone. Her choice of juvenile-enticing characters is proof enough that her style is not intended for a truly adult audience.Plus the middle dragged with insignificant humdrum and a lack of good character development. There was more that could have been explored with a two-spirit/one-body complex. And there were holes in this parasite species theory that bothered me. I didn't care enough about the story to think about them too much, but they were there and made her tale less believable. So creative idea, but the delivery and details didn't quite hit the mark.What I did like in story development was the relationship between Ian and Wanda, how slowly and deeply it changed, until he could read and understand her better than she could and he could completely differentiate between the two souls.What Stephenie Meyer is good at is passionate taboo romance. As for Wanda herself how she changed from first juxtaposing her ingrained annihilation justification with her extreme pacifist views to sympathy for humans and eventually protective love for the planet.I still don't think Stephenie Meyer is a good writer, but she's a decent storyteller. Had Twilight not brought her fame, I doubt this book would go far. Creative plot idea, but it could have been so much more if she had explored the conflicts between Melanie and Wanda more thoroughly and left a morally obvious choice without a happy ending. Then it would have been a book for adults. The book was too shallow and slow enough that I probably wouldn't read it again."

As for me, I FREAKING LOVEEE ITTT!!! I'd pick The Host 100 times over the Twilight series any day!Growing up I was a very shy kid and I didn't like reading out loud in class. I was slower at reading and didn't always know the right words. So in turn, I hated reading. I despised it really.Witch it crazy because reading is such a big part of my life now. I was in my early 20's when I found my love for books and It's all because of this book right here!!! The Host was instrumental in finding that part of me. The Host will always...always have a special place in my heart. It will always be one of my all-time favorites! I have read this book 5 times if that's any indication.I was hooked from the very first page. I love the characters, the plot, the writing style, everything...I love everything about it! All the relationships are strong, the love is electric, and you feel everything they feel. This book has all the feels and it was such an emotional read for me. I cried a LOT, but I also smiled and laughed. The ending was done in such an incredible way. It left me feeling complete and I'm a sucker for HEA's♥. The host was so unique, I haven't read anything like it since."

The Host is probably one of my favorite films, I absolutely love Max Irons, I think he's gorgeous, and while I was watching the film, I also couldn't help but admire the actor who played Ian.I'm a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer, she's one of the authors that made me want to start writing, but I couldn't possibly be as skilled of a writer than she is. She's incredible!I loved the Twilight series but others hated it. Team Jacob all the way!I don't really watch science fiction movies other than Alien, but I genuinely enjoyed this book. It took me awhile to get into it considering I know what happens, but I wanted to see the things that are in the book that might not have happened on screen, and to be honest I felt that it should have been the other way around. I should've read the book first and then watched the film, but that's just me. I always tend to jump on the bandwagon.When I read books, I love a heroine that's strong and a bad-ass. I refuse to read a book that has a weak heroine who let's people walk all over her, it actually makes me really angry when that happens. People might like that though, but for me I love a heroine that can stick up for herself no matter what the situation is, and that's why I loved this book, and that's why I gave this book 5 stars!"

        "user_review": "Talk about an emotional roller coaster!!!! This book was very difficult to rate. If someone were to ask me, \"Was it good?\" I'd have to think for a long time and then say, \"No.... Well... yes, sorta.... No... It was ok.\" But if someone were to ask me if I'd enjoyed it, I'd instantly reply, \"Yes!\" Would I read it again? Probably not. Was it exciting? On occasion. Was in interesting? Very much so, in my opinion. Was it weird? YES! Were the characters well-developed? ... After the first half of the book, yes, I suppose.The Host is about a species of aliens who call themselves Souls. They are born without bodies and can not live very long without one, so they live like parasites inside the bodies of other creatures, completely taking them over. These \"souls\" come to earth and take over the bodies of mankind, living peacefully as they experience the new world around them.The main character of this book, through whose eyes the events of the story are witnessed, is a soul named Wanderer who takes over the body of a young woman formerly known as Melanie. When Wanderer realizes that Melanie is still alive inside of her body, she tries desperately to fight her out, along with the painful and wonderful memories of the man Melanie is in love with. Eventually, Wanderer falls in love with this man, too, through Melanie's memories and the two of them set out to find him.I don't usually read Science-fiction, and so maybe that's the reason I found this book so odd. I wouldn't have picked it up, knowing the storyline as I did, except that my sister had it in her room and I was bored. As weird as the whole alien/possession thing was and is, I found that it was interesting to read about. It was interesting to read the descriptions of human emotions through a character who's never felt them before. This book was VERY EMOTIONAL! Happy, sad, angry, jealous, confused, hurt, obsessed, offended, frustrated, loved, hated, admired, rejected... all feelings were vividly described and painfully lived as I read this book. It ended the way I wanted it to, which made me happy, but.... I don't know. There were just a few things I would have changed had I been the editor of this book.1) Stephanie Meyer seems to be developing, more and more with every book, a strange fascination with writing graphic make-out scenes that are slightly embarrassing to read. There were two in this book that were completely pointless, like she just wanted to write them. There was one that was almost pointless, but I can see why she would think it necessary. I'm not against kissing in books or anything like that, but there is such a thing as overdoing it to the point of ridiculousness.2) I wished that she would have spent less time with the first half of the book and more with the near-end of the book. I wished there would have been more after \"the problem\" was fixed. Hopefully anyone who's read the book knows what I mean by that. To me, the book really got interesting near the middle, and it kind of dragged a little before that. But it wasn't really boring.... Just... uneventful....That's it! This book was uneventful for how long it is! But I wasn't ever bored, exactly. Stephanie Meyer is too good of a writer to allow that. There was always something I enjoyed about it, but there was just enough that was weird or not quite right about it that I can't say that I loved it.In conclusion: I don't know exactly what I think of this book. It was enjoyable! I'm not sorry that I read it! But it was weird, and I would have liked it better with a few changes here and there."

        "user_review": "Aimed at the adult science fiction crowd, as opposed to the Young AdultTwilightfanbase,The Hostisn't about science or where the human race is headed, but about what it means to be human, here and now.Earth has been quietly, non-aggressively conquered by a kind, pacifist species unable to lie or deceive, who go by different names on different planets in different languages. Here they call themselves \"souls\", while the rebel humans who have slipped through the net call them \"parasites\". They are silvery, ribbon-like sentient creatures small enough to hold in two hands, covered in feathery antennae. Inserted into the back of a host body's skull, they take over a host's mind and motor functions to the point that the host's mind is completely subsumed: in effect, killing them.That is, until Earth, where the hosts fight back.Wanderer has lived full life cycles on nine other planets - a record among her kind - before taking a human host, a young woman called Melanie. Unfortunately, Melanie's not going away without a fight, and on top of the gamut of new and intense human emotions Wanderer must contend with, she also struggles to take complete control of her host and find the memories Melanie's keeping from her - memories of her brother Jamie and the man she loves, Jared. They'd managed to elude the alien takeover, until Melanie was caught. As Wanderer gradually gets to know and understand Melanie, she dreams more and more of Jared and Jamie until she finds herself ruled by Melanie's desire to find them, a desire stronger than the need to keep them safe from the parasites.While the story is very different fromTwilight, the writing is much the same, and there are certain qualities in the characters that are becoming almost Meyer trademarks. I can already hear the same complaints and criticisms as I've read regarding the other series, but I'm not sure what these people are expecting - highbrow literature? The earth to move beneath their feet? Some people are never happy, and will often read a book determined to hate it. With one book they complain that something was mentioned and then seemingly forgotten, in another that something was repeated too many times. Personally, I didn't have a problem with the repetition inTwilightand I don't have a problem with it here.I think the first readjustment to my assumptions was with the alien race and Wanderer in particular. When I read about the book last year, I assumed the aliens are aggressive and cruel and the humans would be portrayed as humane and vulnerable. That's how it usually goes, after all, though I don't care for it. The opposite is true here however: the humans are portrayed as greedy, deceitful and violent - which we are, pretty much, especially when cornered - while the souls are kindly, generous, non-suspicious, terrified of humans and - apart from the Seekers - couldn't harm a fly. Especially Wanderer. It's not easy having a pacifist as your main character and narrator, especially one who's easily scared. But Wanderer has her moments of strength too, and resourcefulness, as well as her moral dilemma which is what really carries the story.Regarding the other characters, I really didn't like Jared, and Wanderer's attraction to him is one of the weakest points of the story. The point is made that she loves him because her body, Melanie's body, loves him and responds to him, and her mind too in a way. But it just didn't gel for me, probably because he doesn't come across well. His own dilemma - that the womanheloves is trapped inside a body ruled by an alien - gives him some excuse, but really, what's this thing Meyer has about women loving men who treat them horribly? Edward was pretty mean to Bella in the beginning, remember? Anyway, I liked Ian early on and it was pretty frustrating, the way Wanderer treated him etc.The themes of the novel are pretty obvious, and definitely well-meaning, but still interesting. Questions of whether humans deserve to live on when we are so cruel to each other, and waste resources etc. The souls don't even use money, they take only what they need, and treat everyone with the same kindness. This raises the age-old issue of individuality, which is often the victim - and the ace up humans' collective sleeve - in such stories. The same theme was explored in Scott Westerfeld'sUglies/Pretties/Specialstrilogy, for example.Definitely one of the things I liked about this book was the conflict between Melanie and Wanderer, having two minds in one body with one more dominant than the other. It reminded me of Annon and Riane in Eric van Lustbader's Pearl Saga, a boy in a girl's body whose individual identities are slowly merging yet still conflicting - written so well, I think Lustbader created a whole new gender. It's simpler here because they're both female, but other problems arise because of it - like loving the same man, or of Wanderer wanting to respond to Ian but unable to because her host body lusts after another man. Among other things ;)Because I didn't like the charactersas muchas I did in Meyer's Twilight series, I didn't fall in love with this book. It's an oft-times exciting story, with moments of tension and uncertainty, but I would have liked to understand the souls more - I didn't really understand where they came from or how they came to be, it's kind of like the chicken-or-the-egg: if souls can't survive without host bodies, how did they come to be? How did they get inside their first hosts? - and it was a tad bit heavy-handed on the moralising. Not enough to annoy me, but it's there nonetheless.In short, if you enjoyed the Twilight series, you'll probably enjoy this because it means Meyer's style won't aggravate you; if, on the other hand, you didn't enjoy them, and you have bitched and moaned about her writing style like so many other people, I'd rather youdidn'treadThe Host, not 'cause your criticisms will be wrong, but because you're missing thestory. I should know, I've bitched and moaned about books I don't like often enough before. But I don't usually go on and read more books by the same author, unless I'm hoping they'll have improved. And I think Meyer's writing is improving, but it is what it is: simple, unadorned, reflective, introspective (but not too much), and clear. Even the repetition is necessary, which I think is true ofTwilightas well."

        "user_review": "Not a bad sci-fi story. A little like the Twilight series - some of the formula poured over into here. I feel like the creativity level was a lot higher as Meyer was working with an alien species of her own creation and not necessarily the myths and legends of the vampires and werewolves.My only issue is that it seemed to drag on a bit at times. This was only compounded by its length. This is one of those books that I think could have benefited with a trimming.I think this book was advertised as Meyer getting away from YA, but it is pretty much YA. This is an interesting place to bring up the argument about what makes a book YA? I have seen some books designated YA and it seemed to be only because one of the main characters is a teenagers. Other times, there are books where all the characters are adults that feel so YA it's not even funny! Thoughts?I don't think you can go wrong with this one if you are looking for a thrilling, sci-fi, YA novel - if you don't mind a bit of filler!"

        "user_review": "I just can't comprehend why so many people are rating this book 5 stars. Seriously, why? I understand we are in love with Twilight, but it's not a good enough reason to support this mediocrity.I was extremely disappointed by Breaking Dawn, but decided not to be a hater and give SM another chance. So I opened The Host. I have to say, I have never had to put this much effort into reading a book in my life. If I didn't know who SM was, I wouldn't even bother to read after page 10, it was that boring and uninspired. But because of SM, I continued on, especially after some people told me that it would get better after about 250 pages. Oh boy, were they wrong! I was more like 500 pages. It took me 3 days to get through first 100 pages (to compare, it took me probably about 3 days to read Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse). After that I just skipped through the rest of the book within a couple of hours. You can literally read every 50th page and not miss anything! There is absolutely nothing going on in this book! Pages and pages of conversations between Wanda and Melanie. And both these characters are so undeveloped, it's hard to tell them apart. In fact, it's hard to get attached to any character in this book! They all are so flat and dull.This book is marketed as sci-fi/romance novel. Trust me, it is neither. The sci-fi backdrop of this novel is laughable. Altruistic \"souls\" that save planets from cruel species, among these \"cruel species,\" believe it or not, are: Flowers, See Weeds, Bats... It is just plain ridiculous!There is very little romance in the book either. A couple of kisses between underage girls and older guys is all you get, in spite of the fact that this is SM's \"first adult novel.\" \"Adult\" conversation goes as far as discussing that a couple of characters can't have sex because she is too young (of course!) and they don't have contraceptives. Give me a break!So many reviewers say that this book has a deep meaning, that it shows \"what it means to be human\" and demonstrates that we can \"extend the status of \"human\" to other entities,\" etc. I think these people have never read actually good books. In fact, I don't think they have ever read anything but Twilight before.This is definitely the end of my love affair with SM's writing. I think she struck gold with Twilight, the rest of her creations are just plain bad. You may disagree with me, but this is the reality."

        "user_review": "Body and soul. Two different things.This book isSO MUCH BETTERthan the Twilight series.✅ Amazing main character✅ Great secondary character✅ Hate-to-love✅ Beautiful writing✅ Such a sweet story about acceptance of our differences❗️❗️ Be sure to have kleenex near you when you read this book (or maybe it's just me...)\"But what if it were you?\" Ian asked in little more than a whisper. \"What if you were stuffed in a human body and let loose on this planet, only to find yourself lost among your own kind? What if you were such a good…person that you tried to save the life you'd taken, that you almost died trying to get her back to her family? What if you then found yourself surrounded by violent aliens who hated you and hurt you and tried to murder you, over and over again?\" His voice faltered momentarily. \"What if you just kept doing whatever you could to save and heal these people despite that? Wouldn't you deserve a life, too? Wouldn't you have earned that much?\"Sweet, perfect Ian. He is definitely one of my all-time favorite characters. He is so kind, thoughtful, and amazing. I love him. ❤️Because he was a soul, by nature he was all things good: compassionate, patient, honest, virtuous, and full of love.The Host takes place in a post-apocalyptic reality. Parasitic aliens have taken over the Earth, they travel from planet to planet, and are implanted in host bodies to experience what it is to live as different species. They are virtuous and peaceful beings, trying to perfect our world and create a utopic planet where human violence and greed do not exist anymore. When a Soul is implanted in a body, the host's consciousness usually fades away, but not in the case of Melanie Stryder. When a Soul is put into her body, Melanie refuses to give up and disappear, and her mind battles with the Soul's mind (Wanda) as the story progresses.I love that the main character is Wanda, the alien, but since she is sharing a body with Melanie's consciousness, we get to know them both intimately, and we realize that the Souls might not all be as bad as they seem. I am usually not a fan of alien stories, but this tale is more about what it truly means to be human, what differentiates us from the alien Souls, and why some humans keep resisting and fighting to remain free. A big part of this story turns around a moral dilemma: are we worthy caretakers of the Earth, or do we deserve to be conquered by the pacific Souls that know how to create a world where harmony and peace are dominant, and where the ugliness and flaws of human nature would not be a problem anymore?The fact that the story's main character is Wanda, a Soul that is pure and kind, and does not want to hurt anyone, forces us to see and understand both sides of the dilemma.\"This place was truly the highest and the lowest of all worlds - the most beautiful senses, the most exquisite emotions.. the most malevolent desires, the darkest deeds. Perhaps it was meant to be so. Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached.\"Where Wanda is gentle and kind, Melanie is fierce, stubborn, and loyal. She has learned to be ruthless in order to survive, hide, and protect her family in this world where free humans are hunted. Being forced to cohabit with Wanda creates a lot of internal conflicts and very interesting dialogues between the two characters, each one having her own distinct voice and personality. As the story progresses, Wanda and Melanie will become unlikely allies and will have to learn to trust each other and rely on each other in order to survive and protect their family.\"You are the noblest, purest creature I've ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you,\" he whispered.\"Add to this compelling and original story a beautiful slow-burn romance, and even a kind of love triangle (but it is very well done!), and you are in for an incredible and beautiful adventure, full of emotions. I don't think I will ever tire of re-reading this book.\"It's not the face, but the expression on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the things you do with it. You are beautiful.\"Follow me on Instagram🙂"

Nothing is happening. Nothing has happened. And the aliens who invaded still make junk food. This doesn't make sense. They don't earn money or pay for anything, but they still make junk food. An alien invader who could read the mind of its host would learn to only make food with essential nutrients and stuff, to keep the populace as healthy as possible. They wouldn't waste time and effort making junk food.\"I give up.I just can't do it.107 pages and nothing has happened.This book literally put me to sleep. I said I was in the bath for an hour. I wasasleepfor half of that time. And then I was so mad that the book was so shitty I got out of a perfectly nice bath.And it's made me half sad and half really fucking angry. I like Twilight. It's not the best book or series in the world but it is special to me because I burned out my reading after doing a literature degree, and it took me a year to even pick up a book. Twilight was that book. It welcomed me back into the world of reading, and I've slowly been enjoying it more and more for the past two years. It was easy to read, fast, and relatively painless until you start looking at the deeper aspects.If I had picked up The Host in September of 2009 instead of Twilight, I probably wouldn't be reading yet.This book is fucking stupid. I don't care how much worldbuilding has gone on or how many different species of aliens there are or even what it's like seeing their worlds from their perspective. Which I should, becasue that is what is awesome about sci-fi. But who the fuck would want to live their life as an inter-connected sea weed? Or a land-based plant? They don't do anything. They just grow and reproduce. They don't live. They just exist.EDITHow THE FUCK did this parasitic species evolve? In Animorphs, the book series byKatherine Applegatethe idea pretty much mirrors (I know it's not original but I grew up with it so bite me), the Yeerks evolved alongside the Gedds, and the Gedds were pretty crappy hosts anyway. The Yeerks were expanding to give their brethren better hosts so they could experience the world like everyone else: notably, Yeerks are blind, and they love being able to see through their hosts. Souls are obliterating entire races just because they think they can do better.How the hell did souls evolve and how the fuck did they evolve so that they need to be surgically implanted? The Yeerks evolved a way of doing it themselves, with anaesthetic solutions to dull the pain of drilling into the brain. The souls literally makes no sense. To gain the abilities to take over the brain of another host you'd need very specific evolution, and when technology is introduced evolution stops. This is why humans haven't evolved for a very long time, because they've been using tools and technology for ages - manipulating the world around you, adapting to change (such as wearing clothing in colder climates) leads to no need to evolve, for example, fur. So how do you get a soul from its pre-parasitic days to a parasitic state via evolution if they need to be surgically attached?END EDITAnd what is Meyer's obsession with eyes being able to give people away? In Twilight, red-eyed vamps are the bad guys and golden-eyed vamps are the good guys (I don't remember if anyone says what colour eyes the vamps who drink donated blood from a bag have). In The Host, the parasites give people a shine around their pupil. Meyer may be reading too deeply into the whole 'eyes and the window to the soul' thing. Ha ha, I just made a funny.And the book opened with a scene that was just contradictory.The Healer said anyone could do the procedure in a back street alley yet they needed a lot of tech just to get Wanderer into Melanie. Don't say something is really fucking easy and then go and show exactly how not-easy it is. Fucking fuck fuck (can you tell I'm exasperated?).And where is the conflict?Something about Wanderer's chaperone needs some information that Wanderer can't get from Melanie so they're threatening to evict her from Mel's body. No idea what information it is or why it's so important they get it. Suspect it's something to do with the location of the rebel base. Insert Star Wars joke reference here.If this was Meyer's first attempt at getting published, she would have been laughed out of the industry. I read 107 pages and nothing has happened! At least in 100 pages Bella had met Edward! There is such a thing called THE INCITING FUCKING INCIDENT and as an aspiring traditionally-published author, I pretty much chase what the agents say they want. Such as no prologues, for example. So it pisses me the hell off when an established author wields such clout no one cares what the fuck she writes so long as she puts out another book *cough*Cassandra Clare*cough*.Sometimes inciting incidents are happening on the first page! The first chapter! It's totally awesome when that happens. But why should I bother reading the rest of the book when I've given it 100 pages to give me anything and all it's done is wasted my time?I mean, why should us newbies stick to the rules when veterans can break them and still rake in a payload?I know the answer to that. They're famous. And it boggles my mind WHY.I hope Meyer wrote this in her spare time for herself because I fucking love light sci-fi and I hate to think she sat down and decided the market needed this.This book should be ashamed to call itself sci-fi.I was looking forward to reading this because I'm doing NaNoWriMo and I need a book that isn't totally awesome and I want to spend all day reading (Unearthly,Divergent,Bloodlines,Shiver). But it's just made me fucking mad.Mello and Cory, I should have listened to you. I'm so sorry. Forgive me.I can't write any more because the nap in the bath made me sleepy and when I get sleepy I get emotional and I refuse to cry because I hate a book so fucking much.I'm going to go bury myself in a GOOD BOOK because I am sick to fucking death of being burned by bad ones. But first I need a cuddle and to be assured there are still good books out there because the last time I felt this bad about a book (Fallen, Torment) I ended up giving those books away (despite their GORGEOUS cover art) and I NEVER give books away.EVER."

But there is just something about the writing in this book that is making the voices in my head scream. I had the same experience when I read \"Twilight.\"Ms. Meyers is over-the-top descriptive where there is no need to be. If I had to count how many times she wrote, \"I winced.\" or, \"I flinched.\" or, \"I sighed.\" or, \"Ian sighed.\" I bet it would be in the hundreds. She has added TOO many 2 word sentences that would drive most English Professors to madness. I know it is driving me to madness, and I only worked for English Professors.It has gotten to the point to where I may have to set this book aside and move on to something else before I can come back and finish it.If I didn't have the policy of \"no book left unread,\" I would toss it aside. But alas, it is not in my genetic makeup to leave a book unread.Dang.ONE WEEK LATER:Ok, I stuck it out and finished the book. I can't say that I like it much better than what I said above. I don't know why this was classified as an adult novel. It read way too much like her Twilight series without a lot of complication. Her relationships and inward character battles are exhausting and juvenile. I do have to say that maybe my expectations were a little too high for this book and that is why I am disappointed.However, I will end with this: who is the one getting books published?

I never read Stephanie Meyer before, but i love this book. She really is a good writer. The only downside that i had was that i watched the movie first - therefore i knew what was going to happen. But book was so much better, with more informations about Souls, and better characterization. And, one important thing: you will either love or hate this book.One thing also that i really loved was that it was not an insta love, no matter how it seemed. The whole book happens in a long period of time - months actually, but nothing felt extremely rushed. And it can also be said that this is actually a love fourangle - 3 boddies and 4 souls. This story is actually centered on romance and less on science fiction (if it can even be put as sci fi, because we only meet aliens...and find out about some of their worlds).\"What was it that made this human love so much more desirable to me than the love of my own kind? Was it because it was exclusive and capricious? The souls offered love and acceptance to all. Did I crave a greater challenge?...Or was it simply better somehow? Because these humans hate with so much fury, was the other end of the spectrum that they could love with more heart and zeal and fire?\"___________________________________________STORY:___________________________________________World has never been more perfect - there are no wars, no hunger, no unecessary pain, no illness. But, the world belongs to the aliens called Souls. They are conquers and they are \"parasites\". They need hosts to live - otherwise they die. And when they discovered Earth which was slowly being destroyed, they thought it was perfect chance to save it. Therefore, they occupy it and start fixing the Earth. Souls are kind, caring, intelligent race, but can their good qualities compare to what they had done to human race? They destroy minds of humans and possess the bodies. Only a handful of people are left on Earth, the unpossessed ones called rebels. And they want to take their world back, but they can't do anything against them. To make things go as planned and to protect Souls, Souls placed Seekers to be something like a police for them. Seekers are the only one who are not honest, who lie and who hurt - and they are eager to find every human there is.This is a story about Wanderer, a Soul who was put into the body of Melanie Stryder, a rebel human.The thing that Wanderer didn't expect though was that Melanie is still alive and kicking in her mind. Melanie wants her body back, but she can't do anything about it and Wanda wants her gone, because the body belongs to her now. Melanie then shows her memories of Jared, her boyfriend and Jamie, her brother, and Wanda begins to realize that she slowly falls in love with those humans. And when she goes to try to find them, things don't exactly go as planned. The only thing left is to keep moving forward.___________________________________________CHARACTERS:___________________________________________♦WANDERER/WANDA AND MELANIE/MEL:\"Body and soul. Two different things\"Melanie and Wanderer are both kind, caring and wonderful characters. They made me feel so much, both of them are the characters i really love, and i loved how the book was told from Wanda's perspective. Wanda, the Soul, is one of the most kind of them all. She is called Wanderer for a reason: she never settled on any planet, and she was on a lot of them. Earth is all knew to her, and human race is confusing to her as well...our emotions are not easy for her at the beginning. But, she begins to feel like Earth is the planet for her:\"This place was truly the highest and the lowest of all worlds - the most beautiful senses, the most exquisite emotions.. the most malevolent desires, the darkest deeds. Perhaps it was meant to be so. Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached.\"And even though she didn't like Melanie at the beginning, as can be said for Mel too, she starts loving Mel, and the other way around, until they became friends and sisters by souls.But, even if Melanie spammed her mind with Jared and Jamie, she can't really know how she feels. She begins to love Ian, but her body loves Jared....and it makes it so confusing to her.Melanie is fun, she is sarcastic, strong and amazing. And she is a fighter. She doesn't give up easily and her love for Jared and Jamie is so strong that she starts showing memories to Wanda, so she could understand. I loved Melanie, she was just awesome :)\"Melanie Stryder?\" he asked, addressing her.We both started at the name.Ian went on. \"I'd like the chance to speak with Wanda privately, if you don't mind. Is there any way that could be arranged?\"Of all the nerve! You tell him I said no chance in hell! I do not like this man.My nose wrinkled up.\"What did she say?\"\"She said no.\" I tried to say the words as gently as they could be said. \"And that she doesn't… like you.\"Ian laughed. \"I can respect that. I can respecther. Well, it was worth a try.\" He sighed. \"Kind of puts a damper on things, having an audience.\"What things?Mel growled.I grimaced. I didn't like feeling her anger. It was so much more vicious than mine.Get used to it.♦JARED:Jared is Melanie's boyfriend. They met when Mel was robbing someone, and they both thought the other one was Soul... Except Jared noticed it first and he kissed her, which made Mel angry and she punched him (he deserved it).\"My name is Jared Howe. I haven't spoken to another human being in more than two years, so I'm sure I must seem… a little crazy to you. Please, forgive that and tell me your name, anyway.\"\"Melanie,\" I whisper.\"Melanie,\" he repeats. \"I can't tell you how delighted I am to meet you.\"And then, they slowly but surely, fall in love.But, when he finds out that Melanie is gone and that Wanda took her place, he becomes cruel and unforgiving. He hurt Wanda many times and he said many many unkind things. And it shattered both Mel's and Wanda's heart seeing him like that. In some way, i can understand what he felt, it's not easy when the person you love is gone. And that someone else took her place. But he didn't have to be that much cruel (no wonder why everyone is team Ian). And even after all of that, i started liking the poor bastard, and in the end i loved him.♦IAN:Ian is one of my favorite characters in this book. Even though he wasn't exactly kind to Wanda in the beginning (in that include him trying to strangle her), he grew to my heart. He regret what he had done to Wanda and soon starts seeing her as herself, not just the body. He starts to like her and eventually, he starts loving her.\"It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful.\"♦JAMIE:Jamie is Melanie's little brother. He was forced to grow up earlier than he wanted to. He became like an adult, despite his young age. He wanted to believe that Melanie was still alive, he wouldn't accept it otherwise, and he is the one of the rare ones who thought that Wanda is wonderful person and that she should be given a chance...♦EVERYONE ELSE:Jebwas amazing. When he was young he found out about a cave, which fortunately, saved their lives by becoming a perfect hiding place for humans who survived. The motto he has is \"My house, my rules\" and everyone respects him. He believed in Wanda, he saw her as she is, he liked her from the beginning and he was kind to her.Kyle, Ian's brother, got on my nerves so many times, but in the end, i loved him too. Ian doesn't like him, and actually, no one really does, mostly because of his attitude and because he was irritating.Wanda's Seekeris one of the characters i don't know how to feel about. We find out about her, but for me she was just confusing. But she isn't a quitter and she knows what she is doing. And that makes her scary opponent.There are so many characters i wish to talk about, but i would be tempted to spoil and we don't want that to happen, do we? :D___________________________________________OVERALL:___________________________________________I love this book. And i am sad that it ended. But, i will surely read it again and again, because i want to be with Mel, Wanda, Ian and Jared again... I am also happy that there is going to be a sequel and i can't wait for it.This review can be found on my blog:infinity-of-time.blogspot.comalso known as..."

If I haven't already died... then there you go.DEAD! <3Everybody, we haveTHE HOST TEASER TRAILERin this world now.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUkE5Q...First things first.Dear Author,Do you want readers to have an optimistic opinion about you? Do you want to be normal and popular again after your dramatic fail, you know what I am talking about, of-course, The Twilight series? Here are three steps to make your life better again.Tell all the publishers to stop printing The Host.STEP NO 1-Change the cover. The eye is just too creepy.STEP NO 2-Change your name on the cover to, \"Bad author gone good- in the human world\"STEP NO 3-ERASEThe following line, \"Author of the twilight saga\"And then let them print. I ensure you, The host will sell more than you have ever expected or imagined.Yours truly,Saniya.P.s... I still don't like you, get over it.Ahh. After reading this book for one whole week, I can finally say...I liked it.You: Hahaha, you are kidding me, right? You are talking about Stephenie Meyer here? Author of The 'twilight' saga, remember?Me: Hahaha, Sadly, I am not. -_-Let me show you a prove,\"Unexpectedly moving.... Stephenie Meyer's novels throb with an overwhelming emotional intensity.\"- ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTIONHere is the thing, whoever wrote this, was a really good human. The very first words said were my feeling,Unexpectedly movingand kindly notice the four dots, FOUR dots after that.The situation must be like:The guy/girl reading it, \"Oh, I will hate this book anyway.\"Few moments after reading this book, *Typing on the computer* Unexpectedly moving... \"Damn, what should I write next?\"COPY-PASTE-COPY-PASTE. ~overwhelming emotional intensity shit~Her face, '=D' Net nowadays. Saves the day! :DEven after reading a future, dystopian novel, I liked it. (I hate dystopian novels like anything, nowadays) The book would definitely be confusing for readers who haven't read books based on the future or soul before, at first, but then it becomes easy to understand and follow afterwards.I think the only reason I finished this book so late was because the author wrote this book so slowly. One chapter consisted of her laying down, one of her eating, one of her feeling awkward and so on. This book could have easily been for about 400 pages if the author didn't use the pages unnecessarily on how the heroine was feeling and all.And after a few chapters, I also started noticing that the writing was somehow, forced. Not like, \"WRITE IT OR I WILL KILL YOU\" but like, \"how can I make this book much longer than it already is.\" Some situations were so not necessary. It clearly looked like she was writing this book for a movie.Anyway, surprise surprise... or not. Saoirse Ronan is playing Melanie Stryder in The Host movie which is gonna be released in 2013. =D I am so waiting for it! ^.^The story was good, nothing that I could explain and yes.I LOVE YOU IAN! =DMARRY ME! ^.^I HEART YOU! <3I, SANIYA, A HUMAN SOUL, LOVES YOU!I LOOKED UP ALL ABOUT YOU ON THE NET!I KNOW, I KNOW, I AM NOT A CRAZY STALKER!..actually I am... *hehe*GOSH, HOT! ^.^ Everyone wants Ian Somerhalder to be Ian. And if, IF he is cast-ed as Ian, If will die with joy and have tears in my eyes of pure happiness.Yeah, yeah. Give this book a chance, its really good, blah, blah, blah. And I will give this book 4/5 stars. :DBut seriously, don't make a trilogy out of this. Let it be a stand alone novel. Please. :)"

I remember loving it when I read it when it first came out (around 12-13 years ago) and when a friend was going to read it I figured it was time for a re-read. The audio was a bit slow paced, as I listen at x2 speed normally, and I was able to listen to this one at x2.5 speed. I loved it just as much this time around. It made me cry more than once and I forgot that it was an emotional one, at least for me. I especially love Ian and Jamie. This made me nostalgic to read some of my old favorites.Audio book source: Libby (library borrow)Story Rating: 4 starsNarrators: Kate ReadingNarration Rating: 4 starsGenre: Sci-fiLength: 23 hours"

        "user_review": "[The exchange below is part of a conversation between myself and ChatGPT. The answer given was ChatGPT's first response to the question, and I have not edited it in any way.Note that, as described at greater length in the comment thread, ChatGPT's opinions on \"La Prisonnière\" do not obviously agree well with the content of the book.]Me:Write a sexy, funny 500 word review of Stephenie Meyer's \"The Host\", comparing it to Marcel Proust's \"La Prisonnière\", the epic of Gilgamesh, and \"Noddy in Toyland\".ChatGPT:I recently read Stephenie Meyer's \"The Host\" and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a far cry from her \"Twilight\" series, and I found it to be a refreshing and entertaining read.One of the things I found particularly interesting about \"The Host\" is how it explores the idea of possession and how it can affect an individual's identity. This theme is not unlike Marcel Proust's \"La Prisonnière\", in which the main character is held captive by her own desires and memories. In \"The Host\", the main character, Melanie, is taken over by a soul called Wanderer, but instead of losing her identity, the two must learn to coexist and come to understand each other's thoughts and feelings.Another aspect of the book that I found fascinating was the way it dealt with the themes of love and loyalty. This reminded me of the epic of Gilgamesh, in which the titular character must embark on a journey to find the secret of eternal life in order to impress the woman he loves. In \"The Host\", the character Jared must fight to protect Melanie, even after she has been taken over by Wanderer, because of his love for her.At the same time, \"The Host\" also has a playful and light-hearted side, reminiscent of \"Noddy in Toyland\". This is particularly evident in the character of Jamie, Melanie's young brother, who provides much of the book's humor with his playful antics and childlike innocence.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed \"The Host\" and would highly recommend it to fans of science fiction, romance, and coming-of-age stories. It's a clever and well-written book that manages to be both thought-provoking and entertaining._______________I've seen worse. It could have tried harder with the sexy and funny, but maybe I was too demanding?"

        "user_review": "Wanderer has just arrived on Earth and been implanted into her new host. She has lived on seven worlds before coming here. She is arriving toward the end of the alien invasion when very few humans remain. The aliens are known as \"souls\" and are a peace loving type that don't know of violence or lying.Very few humans remain on Earth. When the remaining humans are discovered, they are captured by Seekers - the closest thing to a police force the \"souls\" have. Once captured, they are prepared for implantation where a small cut is placed at the base of the skull and the \"soul\" is put in the body. The \"soul\" connects to the body and takes control. The first experience the \"soul\" has is the receiving of the host body's memories. Typically, the host recedes and leaves the \"soul\" alone to continue life as usual. For Wanderer, this didn't happen.Since the only humans left are ones that are rebels, placing a new \"soul\" into an adult has become risky. The rebels seem to resist the implantation since they know what is happening. The Wanderer was granted this request because of her experience on so many other worlds and has proven herself as a strong and brave \"soul.\" Melanie is the name of Wanderer's host and Melanie doesn't go away quietly.Melanie remains active and talks to Wanderer all the time. Melanie bombards Wanderer with her memories of life so much so that Wanderer feels the same feelings that Melanie did when she had control over her own body. Melanie hides the memories that Wanderer needs though. A Seeker has been assigned to Wanderer in order to get information about the human rebels that worked with Melanie. Melanie is strong enough to block those memories from her.Eventually, in a weakened state, Melanie allows something to slip through the wall she has constructed to keep Wanderer away from the people she loves. She shows her memories of Jared, the man Melanie desperately loves, and Jamie, her younger brother. These memories overwhelm Wanderer and she physically aches for Jared and Jamie herself. Melanie knows where they might have gone into hiding since she was captured. She convinces Wanderer to go search for them and when the chance presents itself she slips away from the Seeker and sets off to find the people THEY love.When Wanderer finally stumbles upon the rebels she is both elated and terrified. She is so relieved to know that Jared and Jamie are both alive and well, but at the same time, is frightened for her own life. Wanderer endures weeks of isolation and deprivation once in custody while the rebels decide what to do with her. Slowly some people warm up to her and begin to allow her some freedom around the hideout, but she is never alone. They are afraid she is there to get information to take back to the Seekers and then come back and capture them all. It takes a very long time for them to see that she has no intention of turning anyone in to the Seekers.The story is complex. Not only is there the issue of Melanie loving Jared and the Wanderer loving Jared because of Melanie's memories; we also have Ian, another member of the rebels. Ian takes it upon himself to become a permanent fixture in Wanderers life. He is friend and protector and begins to have feelings for her and her alone (not Melanie since he didn't know her prior to the invasion).The story ends on a note of hope. It is an emotional ride from beginning to end - all 631 pages. Any science fiction fan will enjoy this story, but I think Stephenie Meyer may have done for science fiction what she did for fantasy when she wrote Twilight. THE HOST is set in enough of a realistic setting that even people who aren't sci-fi fans will enjoy this story. I want to read it again, but I have so much else to read that I can't right now, but THE HOST is definately on my \"to be read again\" pile. I hope Stephenie Meyer writes another novel after she finishes with the Twilight Series."

        "user_review": "So much potential in this book.I don't understand why Stephenie Meyer isn't continuing the sequels and it's been 8 years since this was published. I loveTwilight Sagabut this is better and I'm not kidding. I have watched the movie first without any idea of the story and I really enjoyed it but my reading experience was incredible.\"Souls\" are parasitic like aliens invading the humans on Earth making them as theirhost. These souls lived for thousands of years and have taken over many living things but humans are challenging because some of them are resistant to be inhabited. With a surgical procedure, these parasites were put in their hosts and they gain access on their memories. It's their decision to adapt their host's memories or erase them completely and make a new identity for themselves. Mostly, they erase them and it's like killing their souls but the body remains alive.The concept is fascinating, unique and intriguing. Despite of the slow pacing, everything in this book is intricate.Our main characters areWanderer/Wanda, a soul andMelanie Stryder, a human. Wanderer occupies Melanie's body but Melanie's memory is strong and vivid and her presence makes it difficult for her to fully take over. These two communicated through the mind and somehow shared a bond.Wanderer is a special soul. She's humble, selfless and caring. While Melanie is a courageous, tough and bold woman.These two were different in some ways but they are both complex and I love them equally as heroines. They helped each other to find Jared Howe, Melanie's boyfriend and Jamie, Melanie's younger brother and locate Jeb's hideout (Melanie's uncle) which is an enormous cave.There are other humans in the cave and they are against Wanda to live with them. It took time before they got used to her and assured that she's not going to expose them to Seekers. Wanda adapted to human ways and she really appreciate their acceptance to her. She works hard and even it's dangerous, she helps on raids later on.The romance in this book is fascinating. It is a love triangle (but not really) and it's well done.You don't know how torn I am between Ian O'Shea and Jared Howe.Goodness gracious, Jared is more of a bad boy than Ian. You know how I love bad boys but how can I resist Ian? He's so sweet, protective and gentle. I can't decide who I want. With Max Irons and Jake Abel portraying them? Perfect! Especially Max Irons ASDFGHJKL ;)Seriously, I am hoping Stephenie Meyer will continue writing the sequels. My waiting game is ON...forever."
